                <p>Of a Journey to attend the Indian Treaty, pro<lb/>-posed to be held at <placeName

                        >1793</date>;<lb/> interspersed with various observations remarks,<lb/> and
                    circumstances, that occurred on this inte-<lb/>resting occasion. </p>
                <label>INTRODUCTION</label>
                <p>As preliminary information to the reader, it may<lb/> be proper to state, that
                    about the year <date when="1791">1791</date>, a mis-<lb/>understanding existed
                    between the United States,<lb/> and several of the Indian Tribes. On this
                    occasion,<lb/> the Meeting for Sufferings held in <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, ad-<lb/>dressed a memorial to Congress, the
                    object of which<lb/> was, to show the expediency of pursuing
                    pacific<lb/>measures towards settling the disputes with the In-<lb/>dians. Their
                    representation was well received; —<lb/> but the measures they recommended were
                    not then<lb/>adopted; and the calamities of war still continuing to<lb/>prevail
                    on the Western frontiers of the States,--<lb/> the Yearly Meeting held in <date
                        when="1792">1792</date>, appointed a large<lb/>Committee, to unite with the
                    Meeting for Sufferings,<lb/> in deliberating on this momentous subject, and
                    if<lb/> practicable, to recommend such measures, as would<lb/> be most likely to
                    promote peace and friendship with<lb/> the Indians.</p>
                <p>Early in the year <date when="1793">1793</date>, deputies from several
                    In-<lb/>dian Nations, visited Philadelphia, with a view of<lb/>
                    <pb n="50" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_050"/> forwarding an accommodation of
                    differences with<lb/> the United States: and, Government having agreed<lb/> that
                    a treaty should be held in the Indian country,<lb/> near <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit</placeName>, during the summer following, — those<lb/> Indian
                    deputies repeatedly urged that some Friends<lb/> should attend the negociations,
                    stating, that “the<lb/> Nations they represented had a special confidence<lb/>
                    in Friends, as a people who, from their first settle-<lb/>ment in America, had
                    manifested a steady adherence<lb/> to the maintenance of peace and friendship
                    with the<lb/> Natives.” In accordance with the desire which<lb/> Friends had
                    long felt, to promote peace, the propo-<lb/>sal was acceded to; and six Friends
                    were deputed to<lb/> accompany the Commissioners appointed by govern-<lb/>ment,
                    on this occasion, after having obtained the<lb/> President's approbation.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners appointed on this embassy<lb/> were, <persName key="glinc1"

                <p>It was a close<lb/>

                    youngest child<lb/> was much indisposed. But the resignation and for-<lb/>titude
                    with which my beloved companion was sup-<lb/>ported, helped me to bear the

                    and a violent gale ensued<lb/> from the north east. The tide also leaving us,

                    anchor, and ran<lb/> almost ashore. About daylight our captain ran in<lb/> to
                    the wharf again. We took the opportunity of<lb/> going to forenoon and afternoon
                    meetings. At the<lb/>last of which, <persName key="wsave1">William
                        Savery</persName> desired to see Friends<lb/> and others, at seven o'clock
                    in the evening. About<lb/> which time, the streets being crowded with
                    people<lb/> going to meeting, the captain sent a messenger to <lb/>call us on
                    board. The strait indeed was great; but<lb/> William and I agreed, let the
                    consequences be what<lb/> they might, we would attend the meeting; we did<lb/>
                    so, and a favoured time it was. About nine o'clock, <lb/><pb n="53"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_053"/> several Friends, merchants of the city,
                    accompanied<lb/> us to the vessel, where the passengers and captain<lb/> were in
                    a heat; but we kept down, and it blew over.<lb/>
                    <persName key="clans1">Capt Lansing</persName> told me afterwards with
                    seriousness,<lb/> he did believe the storm was permitted in order to<lb/> give
                    us time for the meeting.</p>
                <p>About midnight they weighed anchor, and stood<lb/> up the <geogName key="nrive"
                        >North river</geogName>. Our progress was slow and te-<lb/>dious, which gave
                    us opportunity to view the rug-<lb/>ged margin of that great water, which
                    exhibited sub-<lb/>jects for awful contemplation. The rocks and moun-<lb/>tains
                    rise from the water several hundred feet high;<lb/> on the tops of divers of
                    which, are the remains of<lb/> fortifications made in the time of the late war;
                    at<lb/> some of which places, bloody contests had been<lb/> held. We passed
                        <placeName key="westp">West Point</placeName>, <placeName key="fputn">Fort
                        Putnam</placeName>, and <lb/>divers others on the tops of the highest hills,
                    com-<lb/>manding the prospects of diSirent reaches of the<lb/>

                <p>We passed a stream tumbling over the
                    rocks<lb/> into the river, called the <geogName key="buttf">Buttermilk
                        Falls</geogName> — a good<lb/>seat for a mill. But the barren appearance of
                    the<lb/>banks, with the prospect of the divers dark habita-<lb/>tions of death
                    and destruction, brought me into a<lb/> humbling sense of the excellency of that
                    holy reli-<lb/>gion, which breathes peace on earth and good will<lb/> to men.
                    The situation of these strong holds on the<lb/>tops and peaks of mountains,
                    perhaps three or four<lb/>hundred feet high, were associated with ideas
                    which<lb/>more strongly confirmed my mind in the approach<lb/>of that day, in
                    which the King of kings will exalt<lb/>his holy mountain above them all.</p>
                <p>Passed by <placeName key="nwind">New Windsor</placeName>, <placeName key="marlb"

                        >Barnagat</placeName>. At the latter are many limekilns, which<lb/>
                    <pb n="54" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_054"/> burn lime for New York. The kilns are in
                    the<lb/> bank, close to the river. <placeName key="pough"
                        >Poughkeepsie</placeName> is a village<lb/> on the east side of the river.
                    The land appears bar-<lb/>ren and shrubby, especially where the limestone<lb/>
                    mostly abounds.</p></div>

                <p>About six in the morning, arrived at
                        <placeName key="alban">Alba-<lb/>ny</placeName>, having sailed one hundred
                    miles in twelve hours.<lb/> Last night we passed the city of <placeName
                        key="huds">Hudson</placeName>, where a<lb/> number of Friends reside. At
                        <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> we met with<lb/> great civility.
                    The minister of the congregation in-<lb/>troduced himself to us, and said he
                    wished our er-<lb/>rand crowned with success; and that he would make<lb/> it his
                    care, publicly to offer up his prayers for us,<lb/> which would be joined by ten
                    or eleven hundred<lb/> others, and he hoped would be available. He
                    ap-<lb/>peared a good natured, tender spirited man. His<lb/> name was <persName
                        key="bass2">Bassett</persName>.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, five Indians passed through this<lb/> town. I stopped them at
                    the city tavern, gave them<lb/> some refreshment, and money to bear their
                    expenses.<lb/> Their company consisted of an old woman, a son,<lb/> two
                    daughters, and a grandson. One of the young<lb/> women was named <persName
                        key="mehet">Mehetable</persName>, the other <persName key="ketur"
                        >Keturah</persName>.<lb/> Our secretary, Story, sent a written message to
                        <persName key="haupa1">Cap-<lb/>tain Hendricks</persName>, at the <geogName
                        key="oneil">Oneida Lake</geogName>, by one of the<lb/> young men, one
                    hundred and twenty miles distant:<lb/> which he engaged to deliver in three
                    days. They all<lb/> appeared simple, and their countenances innocent.<lb/> Their
                    name and visage impressed my mind with a<lb/> remembrance of good old Abraham,
                    Isaac and Jacob.</p>
                <p>The city of <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> is chiefly settled with the
                    de-<lb/>scendants of emigrants from Holland. They are<lb/> generally a recluse,
                    busy people: which bears the<lb/> appearance of inhospitality, or want of
                    sociability <lb/><pb n="55" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_055"/> and attention to
                    strangers. When we arrived at the<lb/> city tavern, we found <persName
                        key="glinc1">general Lincoln</persName> nearly alone.<lb/> He was very
                    anxious to move forward that after-<lb/>noon, for which purpose a horse and
                    chair was sought<lb/> and procured: the horse was a poor old gray, such<lb/> as
                    I have seen turned out to die. This treatment of<lb/> the general roused my
                    feelings for the honour of our<lb/> government, and the regard due to its
                    respectable<lb/> officers: of which number I considered him as one —<lb/>
                    especially on the present intended peaceful embassy.<lb/> I then went out, and
                    represented the reflections it<lb/> must draw upon the reputation of the place,
                    to <persName key="clans1">Capt.<lb/> Lansing</persName> and some others, who had
                    exulted much in<lb/> the antiquity and reputation of their city. They<lb/>
                    pretty soon procured a better horse and sulkey, and<lb/> the old friend
                    proceeded that evening to <placeName key="schen">Schenecta-<lb/>dy</placeName>.
                    We staid all night at <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and
                    observed<lb/> their manner of burial; where no women attended:<lb/> neither do
                    they on any such occasions, attend the<lb/> corpse of the nearest relative to
                    the grave. The<lb/> females assemble at the house, and immediately af-<lb/>ter
                    the coffin is borne out, they proceed to eat cakes,<lb/> drink wine, and smoke
                    tobacco for a short time; and<lb/> then all clear out before the men return. The
                    men<lb/> resume the feast, made in consequence of the decease<lb/> of their
                    neighbor or friend, regale themselves, and<lb/> return home.</p></div>

                <p>We got into a wagon, and rode sixteen
                    miles<lb/> to <placeName key="schen">Schenectady</placeName>, situated near the
                        <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogName>. —<lb/> We passed about ten
                    houses on the road, each a ta-<lb/>vern. The land very poor and covered with
                    pines,<lb/> the whole of the way. The town of <placeName key="schen"
                        >Schenectady</placeName> is<lb/> supposed to consist of about three hundred
                    houses,<lb/> mostly Dutch built, except some modern houses of<lb/>
                    <pb n="56" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_056"/>more elegant construction. It appears
                    strange to see<lb/> the manners and customs of the people, and the face<lb/> of
                    the country: yet my mind is mercifully preserved<lb/> in great quietude, and
                    every place looks and feels<lb/> like a temporary home. Dined at a public house in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="schen">Schenectady</placeName>, where we had the pleasure of
                        <persName key="pschu1">General<lb/> Schuyler</persName>'s company. After
                    dinner, we went on<lb/> board a batteau, accompanied by seven others,
                    load-<lb/>ed with our baggage and stores, and embarked on<lb/> the <geogName
                        key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogName>, in the presence of more than<lb/> one
                    hundred spectators. Two of our boats were<lb/> manned with six men each, the
                    other six boats with<lb/> three men each. We proceeded about four miles,<lb/>
                    and stopped at a house, where the mother and three<lb/> children were entirely
                    insane. The three children<lb/> never learned to speak, being idiots — the
                    mother<lb/> went distracted, and was confined in chains. The<lb/> several
                    circumstances attending this distressed fami-<lb/>ly, deeply affected my mind,
                    and caused me secretly<lb/> to acknowledge, that I was not thankful enough
                    for<lb/> the manifold favours and blessings, mercifully dis-<lb/>pensed to
                    me.</p>
                <p>The bed of the <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogName> I suppose to be<lb/>
                    about two hundred yards across, and averaging three<lb/> feet deep; some places
                    shoal and rapid, where the<lb/> poor boatmen had very hard work to make
                    headway<lb/> against the current. The river winds across a val-<lb/>ley about
                    half a mile wide; alternately washing the<lb/> southern and northern hills. The
                    bottoms in the<lb/> bends, and on the banks of the river, are rich black<lb/>
                    sand, exceeding fertile, and tolerably improved, pro-<lb/>ducing wheat, Indian
                    corn, peas, flax, &amp;c in abun-<lb/>dance. We had an agreeable prospect of a
                    range of<lb/> fine plantations, interspersed with an abundance of<lb/>
                    <pb n="57" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_057"/>fruit trees in blossom. Vegetation
                    appeared about<lb/>as forward here as when I left home. It is an old<lb/>
                    settled country: the inhabitants mostly the descen-<lb/>dants of Low Dutch
                    emigrants, and generally, speak<lb/> that language, also, tolerable English.
                    They say it<lb/> was settled before <placeName key="schen"
                        >Schenectady</placeName> or <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>;
                    which<lb/> must be more than one hundred and twenty years.<lb/> One young woman
                    told me, her father's great-grand-<lb/>father was born on the place where she
                    then lived.<lb/> The banks of the river, in general, rise about twelve<lb/> or
                    fifteen feet above the surface of the water, and<lb/> obscure, in a great
                    measure, the pleasing prospect<lb/> of its fruitful margin from travelers who go
                    in boats.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-10">10th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Our little fleet, consisting of eight
                    boats,<lb/> worked by thirty men, exclusive of twelve passen-<lb/>gers, set out,
                    and with great exertions, opposed the<lb/>rapids of the <geogName key="mohaw"
                        >Mohawk</geogName> for about sixteen miles, through<lb/> a champaign
                    country. Passed by many banks and<lb/> points of land, memorable for having
                    forts and for-<lb/>tifications, in time of war; particularly the old
                    resi-<lb/>dence of Sir <persName key="wjohn3">William Johnson</persName>, whose
                    mansion house<lb/> is now in ruins — the lands confiscated, and in
                    pos-<lb/>session of strangers. This estate was said to have<lb/> been obtained
                    from the Indians by chicanery. Such<lb/> is the uncertainty of the most
                    extensive worldly pos-<lb/>sessions, more especially when obtained through
                    un-<lb/>righteous channels. This day we passed a rock pro-<lb/>jecting out of
                    the bank of the river, whereon was<lb/> painted, with great ingenuity, in red
                    colours, a ca-<lb/>noe with the representation of seven men in it.--<lb/> Which
                    is said to be done annually, by Indians,<lb/> coming several hundred miles for
                    that purpose, in<lb/> order to commemorate the slaughter of seven In-<lb/>dians,
                    who went off from that neighbourhood in<lb/>
                    <pb n="58" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_058"/> some former wars, and were all destroyed.
                    We<lb/> passed the mouth of the <geogName key="schoh">Schoharie</geogName>, and
                    stopped<lb/> about a mile higher up the river, on a beautiful<lb/> bank, where
                    we proposed to lodge. Here I saw a<lb/> plough with two wheels, about eighteen
                    inches dia-<lb/>meter, just before the coulter. They are in general<lb/> use in
                    this neighbourhood, and appear to answer the<lb/> end well. Their land is level,
                    light and rich near<lb/> the river. Their field peas are just coming up,
                    and<lb/> appear luxuriant, and beautiful.</p></div>

                <p>Had a fine wind, our little fleet hoisted
                    their<lb/> sails, which propelled the boats against the current<lb/> at about
                    four miles an hour, without the help of set-<lb/>ting poles or oars. Passed the
                        <placeName key="canaj">Canajoharie</placeName>, and a<lb/> mountain called
                    the <geogName key="antho">Nose</geogName>, where is a remarkable<lb/> cave, into
                    which one of our boatmen said he enter-<lb/>ed about five perches, but found so
                    much wind issu-<lb/>ing out of it, that he was afraid to proceed any
                    fur-<lb/>ther. The land in this day's rout, is very good. The<lb/> settlers here
                    were greatly distressed, about the year<lb/>
                    <date when="1780">1780</date>, by the Indians and white people who were<lb/>
                    opposed to the principles of the revolution, and were<lb/> influenced, and, in
                    some instances, commanded, by<lb/>
                    <persName key="jjohn4">John Johnson</persName> (son of Sir <persName
                        key="wjohn3">William</persName>) who took refuge<lb/> with the British, and
                    came on with a party of In-<lb/>dians, &amp;c. into his old neighbourhood, burnt
                    their<lb/> houses, took off many prisoners, and others they<lb/> killed. Where
                    we breakfasted, the man of the house<lb/> told us, his father and father-in-law
                    were both killed<lb/> by them, on the same morning. Where we dined,<lb/> the
                    woman's husband had been killed, in like man-<lb/>ner. This day we passed
                    several old fortifications,<lb/> block houses, &amp;c. which appeared a weak
                    defence:<lb/>and breathing aspirations were raised, to become an <lb/><pb n="59"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_059"/> inhabitant of a city whose walls are salvation,
                    and<lb/> whose light and glory the Lord of hosts is. We<lb/> also passed several
                    places for worship. The whole<lb/> journey of this day was about twenty-three
                    miles.<lb/> The country very fertile, and capable of abundant<lb/> improvement,
                    which may increase the useful trade<lb/> of <placeName key="schen"
                        >Schenectady</placeName> and <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, keep
                    up the sound of<lb/> the millstones near the <geogName key="nrive">North

                    Ve-<lb/>getation appears nearly the same from day to day,<lb/> as we proceed to
                    the north west, which is the gen-<lb/>eral course of the river thus far.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-12">12th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Which was the first of the week, we set<lb/>
                    out from Esq. Nellis's, which is about fifteen miles<lb/> north of <geogName
                        key="otseg">Otsego lake</geogName>, the head source of the north<lb/> branch
                    of <geogName key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogName>, and about fifty miles
                    north<lb/> of the boat and raft navigation of the <geogName key="delaw"
                        >Delaware</geogName>. Pro-<lb/>ceeding up the river we found the water very
                    shoal;<lb/> in many places not more than fifteen inches deep.<lb/> The
                    navigation is exceedingly hurt by the river be-<lb/>ing divided into many parts
                    by islands, some less,<lb/> and some larger, from one to seventy acres in
                    size.<lb/> We landed and tarried awhile at <placeName key="famst">Fort
                        Hendricks</placeName> on<lb/> the south side of the river. Opposite, on the
                    north<lb/> side, comes in, a large stream, called <geogName key="wcana">Canada
                        creek</geogName>,<lb/> about the size of <geogName key="brand"
                        >Brandywine</geogName>. This place was the<lb/> seat of an old Indian king.
                    We noticed many large<lb/> old apple trees, said to have been planted by
                    the<lb/> Indians.</p>
                <p>This day, tho wind blew very brisk, and directly<lb/>against us; which made our
                    progress slow, and the<lb/> labour of the men exceeding hard. With
                    consider-<lb/>able difficulty, we stemmed the current ten miles,<lb/>
                    <pb n="60" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_060"/> to the falls of the river, which are
                    thirty-eight and<lb/> a half feet in three quarters of a mile. It is a very<lb/>
                    romantic spot. In one place, the water pitches down<lb/> about seven feet. Here
                    is a fine grist mill, saw mill,<lb/> and fulling mill. A Scotch gentleman, named
                        <persName key="jport1">John<lb/> Porteous</persName>, is the proprietor of
                    the seat. It will, some<lb/> time, in all probability, become a great interest.
                    —<lb/> Here are great preparations making to open a canal,<lb/> which I think
                    they will complete, as nature has done<lb/> abundance toward facilitating this
                    very important<lb/> object. The river is contracted by rocks and hills<lb/> to
                    one hundred feet wide, at the falls, and for some<lb/> distance below. At this
                    place, a spacious wooden<lb/> bridge is erected across the river. On the
                    north<lb/> side, are evident marks of nature having, at some<lb/> very remote
                    period of time, undergone a great re-<lb/>volution. I think it appears to a
                    demonstration,<lb/> that the river once ran among the rocks, that are<lb/> now
                    thirty perches from the present bed of the wa-<lb/>ter, and twenty feet above
                    its level. Rocks and<lb/> stones are lying in a very irregular position, but
                    so<lb/> smoothed, and worn into curves of many shapes,<lb/> like ovens, large
                    kettles, and some worn down like<lb/> a hollow gum, six or seven feet deep, and
                    bear every<lb/> appearance of the rocks in the bed, and on the sides<lb/> of the
                    river, at present. This afternoon, we enga-<lb/>ged seven wagons to transport
                    our stores and boats,<lb/> one mile across these falls. We were kindly
                    received<lb/> by our friend <persName key="jport1">Porteous</persName>, and the
                    superintendent of<lb/> the canal, a very intelligent man, Major <persName
                        key="fdeza1">Frederick<lb/> Augustus De Zang</persName>; where I drank tea,
                    and lodged.<lb/> He emigrated from Saxony, and married <persName key="clawr1"
                        >Caleb Law-<lb/>rence</persName>’s daughter, of New York. Though this
                    place<lb/> is so rocky and wild, it is said a rattlesnake has not<lb/>
                    <pb n="61" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_061"/> been found at any time, north of
                        <geogName key="wcana">Canada creek</geogName>. On<lb/> the east side of that
                    water, about seven miles distant,<lb/> they abound to such a degree, that the
                    settlers there<lb/> are obliged, in their own defence, to keep large<lb/> herds
                    of swine, of three or four years old — and such<lb/> is the sagacity of the
                    swine, that they will set their<lb/> foot on the head of the reptile, and begin
                    at the tail<lb/> to eat.</p>
                <p>Below these falls, for three miles, the water is an<lb/> amazing depth — perhaps
                    eighty feet deep. Here<lb/> our setting poles were of no account, and our
                    oars<lb/> and paddles were not sufficient to propel the boat<lb/> against the
                    wind; so that at one time I did not know<lb/> but we should here have made our
                    beds. But through<lb/> the abounding mercy of Him “who holdeth the winds<lb/> in
                    his fists, and measureth the waters in the hollow<lb/> of his hand," we got
                    through to comfortable lodgings.<lb/> The three precedingg nights we lay on our
                    mattresses,<lb/> except the general, who was accommodated with a<lb/> bed.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-13">13th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>The wagons assembled about sunrise,
                    took<lb/> our baggage and boats about one mile, to the still<lb/> water above
                    the falls. We dined at our friend <persName key="jport1"
                        >Por<lb/>teous</persName>'s — embarked in the afternoon — passed the<lb/>
                    wolf riffle and one other piece of strong water —<lb/> about six miles, to the
                        <placeName key="gefla">German Flats</placeName> — on the way,<lb/> passed
                    several block houses, and one meeting house.<lb/> Here we were but six miles
                    north of the head wa-<lb/>ters of the <geogName key="susqu"
                        >Susquehanna</geogName>. But it felt to me, a land<lb/> of darkness, and a
                    land of blood. Many of the peo-<lb/>ple had had their relations killed and
                    scalped, whose<lb/> spirits remain rough, and much exasperated against<lb/> the
                    Indians.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-14">14th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <pb n="62" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_062"/>
                <p>Proceeded forward, and that evening
                    reach-<lb/> ed <placeName key="fschy">Fort Schuyler</placeName>, where is
                    erected a wooden bridge,<lb/> whose arch is one hundred and twenty feet
                    wide,<lb/> without any support from below. The butments<lb/> are of framed
                    timber, without stone in any part of<lb/>them. The sweep of the arch appeared to
                    be about<lb/>seven feet. The land in this day's progress, was<lb/> very rich;
                    and the whole face of the country, as far<lb/> as I could see, was flat, and
                    abounding with very<lb/> large sugar trees, elm, white walnut, beech, &amp;c.
                    —<lb/> The water, in this day's journey, which was about<lb/> twenty-three
                    miles, was a fine, deep, still run, great<lb/> part of the way, without using
                    our oars. This coun-<lb/>try settles rapidly. I was much perplexed for
                    miles,<lb/> with the continued smoke from the fires on shore,<lb/> where they
                    are clearing the lands, and manufacturing<lb/> pot and pearl ash, and maple
                    sugar. The potash is<lb/> a great article of trade, selling at from forty-five
                    to<lb/> fifty pounds per ton. At New York, one merchant,<lb/> I was told,
                    procured one thousand tons the last year.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-15">15th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>The morning clear, and the air cold.
                    Here<lb/> the earth is very dry, having had but little rain for<lb/> two months.
                    Several of our company took horse at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="white">Whitestown</placeName>, and rode to <placeName
                        key="fstan">Fort Stanwix</placeName>, at the head<lb/> of the boat
                    navigation, on the <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogName>. The<lb/> fort
                    stands on the highest ground between the wa-<lb/>ters which run to the sea
                    southward, and those which<lb/> run into the <geogName key="oneil">Oneida
                        lake</geogName>, and empty into the <geogName key="stlar">St.<lb/> Lawrence
                        river</geogName>. Our journey this day by water,<lb/> was twenty-four miles.
                    Those who rode by land,<lb/> about sixteen miles. They passed the ground
                    where<lb/> a battle had been fought with the Indians, in the last<lb/> war; in
                    which many fell on both sides; but the In-<lb/>dians kept the ground. The skulls
                    of divers remain<lb/><pb n="63" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_063"/> on the ground,
                    having the marks of the tomahawk<lb/> and scalping knife evidently upon them.
                    One of our<lb/> party brought a skull along with him. The land as<lb/> we came
                    up the river, appears rich. The river about<lb/> one hundred feet wide, and
                    exceedingly crooked,<lb/> much resembling a worm fence — the reaches about<lb/>
                    fifty perches long. The country very little settled.<lb/> We dined in the woods,
                    on the bank of the stream.<lb/> The timber very large, — sugar trees are here
                    in<lb/> abundance — also buttonwood and white walnut of<lb/> large size. Here,
                    and for thirty miles below, hills<lb/> and mountains quite disappear. The land
                    on the<lb/> dividing ridge, stony and thin, much covered with<lb/> pitch pine.
                    But when the earth shall disclose her<lb/> blood, and no more cover her slain, a
                    tremendous<lb/> account must be settled, for the blood shed on the<lb/> banks of
                    the <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogName>. One skeleton, and a gun by<lb/> his
                    side, is said to have been harrowed up a few<lb/> days past — the remains of a
                    beaver hat, decayed<lb/> stockings, &amp;c.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-16">16th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>It took up this day to get the boats and
                    bag-<lb/>gage across the carrying place, one mile, to <geogName key="woodc"
                        >Wood<lb/>creek</geogName>, a small stream about ten yards wide, and
                    very<lb/> shoal. Five of our company, on the morning of the<lb/>
                    <date when="1793-05-17">17th</date>, took wagon, and proceeded down <geogName
                        key="woodc">Wood creek</geogName><lb/> by land. But such a ride I never had
                    before. Pole<lb/> bridges, slotches of mud and water, and short nob<lb/> hills,
                    sometimes one side, then another, like to over-<lb/>set; and the wagon very
                    shackling, made the tour<lb/> very disagreeable. However, in about three
                    hours,<lb/> we arrived at <persName key="crann1">Captain Ranney</persName>'s, at
                    the junction of<lb/>
                    <geogName key="wcana">Canada creek</geogName>. The whole of the eight miles,
                    a<lb/> dreary hemlock and beech wilderness, without in-<lb/>habitant that I saw,
                    except musquetoes in thousands.<lb/>
                    <pb n="64" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_064"/> It appears well adapted for their
                    existence. At the<lb/> mouth of <geogName key="wcana">Canada creek</geogName> we
                    re-embarked, and pro-<lb/>ceeded down <geogName key="woodc">Wood
                        creek</geogName> eight miles to the <placeName key="oakor">Oak<lb/>
                        Orchard</placeName>, where <persName key="jamhe1">General
                    Amhurst</persName>’s army encamped<lb/> on his way to the Canada expedition, in
                    the French<lb/> war. Here our little camp pitched their tents. I<lb/> rested
                    well on the bank of <geogName key="woodc">Wood creek</geogName>.</p>
                <p>Struck our tents early in the morning of the <date when="1793-05-18"
                    >18th</date>,<lb/> and proceeded down the stream about six miles;<lb/> then
                    kindled up a fire on the bank, and cooked a<lb/> breakfast of tea and chocolate.
                    The land continues<lb/> low, level, and rich, abounding with sugar trees
                    and<lb/> white walnut. The navigation of the creek is abun-<lb/>dantly
                    obstructed by vast quantities of timber. —<lb/> Here the stream is about fifty
                    feet wide. These<lb/> waters abound with fish, of which we caught some,<lb/>
                    with a gig, from the bow of our boat, and some<lb/> trout, with hook and line.
                    About noon, we dined<lb/> at the Big Bend, four miles from the lake, on the<lb/>
                    bank of the creek, not having seen a cabin for twen-<lb/>ty- five miles. The
                    banks abound with lofty timber,<lb/> sugar trees, elm, some large oaks, and
                    shellbark<lb/> hickory, in which the pigeons innumerable build<lb/> their nests.
                    Here and there a small fox squirrel ap-<lb/>pears, — a few robins, blackbirds,
                    and jays. About<lb/> three o'clock we came to the entrance of <geogName
                        key="oneil">Oneida<lb/> lake</geogName>, which, though among the number of
                    inferior<lb/> lakes, makes an awful appearance, and is doubtless<lb/> a
                    wonderful display of that infinite Wisdom and<lb/> Power by which the worlds
                    were made. Our course<lb/> along this little ocean appeared to be a little
                    north<lb/> of west; and the wind being brisk from that point,<lb/> we raised our
                    tents, as no habitation appeared. </p>
                <pb n="65" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_065"/>
                <p>This evening, a number of Indians came to our<lb/> camp, viz. <persName
                        key="clewi2">Col. Lewis</persName>, <persName key="cjohn1">Capt.
                        John</persName>, and a very old<lb/> chief, named <persName key="poney1"
                        >Beechtree</persName>, or King Doe, and several<lb/> young warriors, painted
                    red, with black streaks. —<lb/> Some had their ears cut in strings, with
                    trinkets in<lb/> them; and they mostly had bobs of wampum, metal,<lb/> or bright
                    shells, hung in their noses. They had<lb/> two of their wives with them— each
                    had a child<lb/> laced with its back to a board — the front side made<lb/> of
                    skins, lined with soft flannel, and a canopy of<lb/> curious work like
                    embroidery, overhead — of like<lb/> workmanship, were the laces and bandages
                    with<lb/> which the infant was fastened in — these they loose<lb/> with great
                    facility, and take out the babe. The<lb/> whole has the appearance of a case,
                    narrow at bot-<lb/>tom, and widens upwards — it is about two feet in<lb/>
                    length, and has a bow to the front side of it, to go<lb/> over the mother's
                    breast, when she carries the child.<lb/> There were about eleven Indians in this company;<lb/>
                    <persName key="skirk1">Kirkland</persName>, their missionary, was with them, and
                    in-<lb/>terpreted for us. The old chief said he heard we<lb/> were there, and
                    with trembling knees, leaning on<lb/> his staff, he had come to see us; as we
                    were on the<lb/> work of peace, he rejoiced to see us on that errand,<lb/> and
                    hoped the Great Spirit would bless our endea-<lb/>vours, with which he united,
                    and did not know<lb/> what he lived for, except it was to see it. <persName
                        key="cjohn1">Captain<lb/> John</persName> spoke to like import, and said he
                    was glad<lb/> some of the sons of Onas were along. We imparted<lb/> some small
                    tokens of respect to the women and chil-<lb/>dren, who after a visit of about
                    two hours, went<lb/> away, with some of the young men. The old ones<lb/> staid
                    and supped with us on the bank of the lake,<lb/> and then departed.</p>

                <p>About eight in the evening, the wind lulled, we<lb/> struck our tents, and
                    hurried on board. The lake<lb/>was smooth, and the moon shining. We went
                    with<lb/> our oars, beautifully, about twelve miles. Suddenly<lb/> there
                    appeared a cloud rising in the south-west,<lb/> which soon spread, and obscured
                    the light of the<lb/> moon. It began to rain, with a heavy gale of wind,<lb/>
                    and the scene was soon changed, from serenity and<lb/> calmness, into a foaming
                    tempest. Our little fleet<lb/> got scattered — the swells became so great as to
                    ren-<lb/>der oars useless. The water being shoal, and the<lb/> shore rocky, we
                    durst not attempt to run in. Our<lb/> boatmen proposed to raise the mast, and
                    hoist sail;<lb/>which, with great difficulty, from the beating of the<lb/>
                    waves, and the extreme darkness, was effected. —<lb/>After which, our little
                    bark ran violently before the<lb/>wind, rocking over the swells like a tub on
                    the wa-<lb/>ter. But through the providence of Almighty pow-<lb/>er, about break
                    of day, we got into the mouth of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="oneir">Oneida river</geogName>, though several of our boats did
                    not<lb/> arrive for some hours after. This lake is about thir-<lb/>ty miles
                    long, and eight wide. In crossing which,<lb/> I underwent a close and searching
                    baptism, not only<lb/> respecting the present embassy, but all the actions<lb/>
                    of my life: for eternity appeared very near.</p></div>

                <p>Being first day, we resumed our
                    navigation<lb/> down the <geogName key="oneir">Oneida river</geogName> about
                    eighteen miles, to the<lb/> junction of the <geogName key="sener"
                        >Seneca</geogName> or <geogName key="onori">Onondago river</geogName>. It
                    is<lb/> about as large as the <geogName key="oneir">Oneida</geogName>; each
                    perhaps three hun-<lb/>dred feet wide. At this place we met three families<lb/>
                    of new settlers, who were glad to see us, as were<lb/> we to see them. Here also
                    we met several Indians,<lb/> mostly young men and women, marvellously
                    trim-<lb/>med with cut ears, ear-rings and nose jewels. --<lb/><pb n="67"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_067"/> Amongst them, was a young warrior, grimly
                    paint-<lb/>ed; even his hair painted and plaited, and stood out<lb/> on each
                    side in opposite directions.</p>
                <p>Here we had conversation with a man who lives<lb/> at the Salt Springs on the
                        <geogName key="cayug">Cayuga Lake</geogName>, which is<lb/> about ten miles
                    long and seven broad. He related<lb/> that when wood was provided, and two
                    kettles set,<lb/> of sixty gallons each, he could make five bushels<lb/> per
                    day; that the fountain appeared inexhaustible;<lb/> that excellent fresh water
                    springs were found within<lb/>twelve yards of the salt; and that eighteen miles
                    land<lb/>carriage would take it to the <geogName key="chemu">Chemung
                        river</geogName>, a branch<lb/> of the west fork of the <geogName
                        key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogName>.</p>
                <p>We resumed our voyage — passed about a mile of<lb/>rapid water — and afterwards
                    eleven miles of still<lb/> water, to <geogName key="oswef">Oswego
                        Falls</geogName>. Here the river is about<lb/> two hundred yards wide, and
                    the water at one pitch<lb/> all across the river, falls eight feet, and forms
                    a<lb/> strong, foaming rapid for one mile below. The<lb/> banks of this river
                    are low, and subject to be over-<lb/>flowed. The land apparently rich.</p></div>

                <p>Drew our boats across the carrying
                    place,<lb/> about sixty yards, launched in below, and proceed-<lb/>ed to
                        <placeName key="oswft">Oswego garrison</placeName>, held by the British.
                    They<lb/>expecting us, we were admitted, and dined with the<lb/> commanding
                    officer, <persName key="cwick1">Capt. Wickham</persName>. After dinner,<lb/> we
                    pursued our journey on the <geogName key="lakeo">sea of Ontario</geogName>,
                    fifteen<lb/> miles to a harbor called <placeName key="lsodu">Little

                    About the middle<lb/> there is no view of land northward, eastward or<lb/>
                    westward in the clearest day.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-21">21st</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>We sailed and rowed, passed the mouth of<lb/>
                    <geogName key="sodus">Great Sodus</geogName>, to Apple Boom harbour,
                    twenty-seven<lb/> miles from <placeName key="lsodu">Little Sodus</placeName>.
                    This day was exceeding<lb/>
                    <pb n="68" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_068"/> warm on the lake, and the journey very
                    lonesome.<lb/> Day after day not a face to be seen, but our own<lb/> company.
                    The water of the lake is clear and cold;<lb/> much more so than the rivers which
                    empty into it.<lb/> Our navigation is along the southern margin of <geogName
                        key="lakeo">On-<lb/>tario</geogName>. The land appears well timbered and
                    habita-<lb/>ble; but I could perceive no springs, or small rivu-<lb/>lets
                    emptying into the lake. The shore is composed<lb/> of high banks for miles
                    together; then low vallies in<lb/> succession, which form bays and harbors for
                    the<lb/> boatmen in case of sudden storms of wind, which<lb/> are very frequent,
                    and make a surprising commotion<lb/> in the waters. In these storms many
                    adventurers,<lb/> after enduring amazing difficulties, have perished;<lb/> and
                    others have marvellously escaped. We did not<lb/>venture more than one mile from
                    shore. The water<lb/> is from three to ten feet deep — the bottom,
                    appear-<lb/>ed as if paved with close jointed flag stones of seven,<lb/> ten, or
                    twenty feet square — or like a street paved<lb/> with round smooth stones.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-05-22">22nd</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>The wind was high and the water rough.<lb/>
                    We lay in the harbor till four in the afternoon,<lb/> when we journeyed forward,
                    rowing about eight<lb/> miles, and after sundown, made the shore. Where<lb/>
                    also a boat from <placeName key="niaga">Niagara</placeName> came with several
                    passen-<lb/>gers on board — a clergyman, <persName key="tspea1">Townsend
                        Speakman</persName>'s<lb/> brother's six orphan children, and a <orgName
                       key="delaware">Delaware</orgName> In-<lb/>dian man,
                    who could speak some English; he seem-<lb/>ed pleased with the prospect of
                    peace; and said, he<lb/>was at no time for war.</p></div>

                <p>Set out a little after daylight. The
                    wind<lb/> being against us, about eight o'clock we put in to<lb/> shore a little
                    eastward of the mouth of <geogName key="genes2">Genessee<lb/> river</geogName>;
                    struck up fires and breakfasted; then passed<lb/>
                    <pb n="69" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_069"/> on -- and arrived at the <placeName
                        key="oakor">White Oak Orchard harbor</placeName><lb/> about dark. Here we
                    encamped amongst a number<lb/> of Indian graves. Here also came a boat, with
                    two<lb/> families, removing from <placeName key="genes">Genessee</placeName> to
                    Upper Canada,<lb/> on account of the sickly situation of the <placeName
                        key="genec">Genessee<lb/> country</placeName>. In this day's journey the
                    margin of the<lb/> lake appeared very low, the timber small and shrub-<lb/>by,
                    abundance of bays, and swampy ground. Bra-<lb/>doe's bay is the most beautiful
                    of any I saw on the<lb/> sides of the lake.</p></div>

                <p>The air sharp and cold, we stood up the
                    lake<lb/> with a fair, gentle breeze, which gradually increased,<lb/> and
                    carried us with velocity past Golden Hill, Cag<lb/> Inlet, &amp;c. over many a
                    foaming wave, which at<lb/> length ran so high, that the boats began to ship
                    wa-<lb/>ter, and we put into eighteen mile creek harbor.<lb/> Here I walked out,
                    and met with what appeared to<lb/> me to be a piece of antiquity. A mound fifty
                    yards<lb/> in circumference, raised to more than six feet high.<lb/> On the
                    elevation about two feet above the base, is a<lb/> white oak tree, of two feet
                    diameter, which I sup-<lb/>pose has originated since the formation of this
                    artifi-<lb/>cial mount. But the design remains matter of con-<lb/>jecture.
                    Perhaps some kind of fortification, or to<lb/> commemorate some great
                    achievement, or more pro-<lb/>bable the sepulchre of ancient kings.</p></div>

                <p>We struck our tents, and journeyed on
                    eigh-<lb/>teen miles to the garrison of <placeName key="fniag"
                        >Niagara</placeName>, a strong for-<lb/>tification, but a dark, noisy,
                    confused, dirty place.<lb/> We ferried over the river to <placeName key="nav"
                        >Navy Hall</placeName>, in the do-<lb/>minions of the king of Great

                    It<lb/> was now confirmed to us, that the Indians would <lb/><pb n="70"

                    separated from the dear-<lb/>est connexions in life, and driven into the
                    sickly<lb/> season of the year, so that I found a necessity for<lb/> the
                    exercise of faith and patience. My mind was<lb/> turned to the Lord for counsel,
                    in this proving sea-<lb/>son. Several things revolved in my mind — whe-<lb/>ther
                    to to return home, or to try to seek out some of<lb/> the scattered sheep, in

                    To which we replied accord-<lb/>ing to the understanding given. He is a plain

                    for one shive of<lb/> bread, paid twelve shillings for twelve pounds of<lb/>

                    interspersed with a vast number of stiff, pointed<lb/> quills; which are its

                    the Balm<lb/> of Gilead. It resembles the lombardy poplar. Here<lb/> also, the
                    juniper abounds. They are natives of this<lb/> latitude. Gooseberries and
                    currants of divers colours<lb/> and kinds, are found here.</p>

                <p>A wet day—which is a blessing to the
                    earth<lb/> and its inhabitants hereaway, as it has been exceed-<lb/>ing dry.</p>
                <p><date when="1793-05-30">30th</date>. <persName key="jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore</persName>, <persName key="jelli1">John Elliott</persName> and
                    myself,<lb/> went about two and a half miles, to visit that phe-<lb/>nomenon in
                    nature — the great <geogName key="niagf">Falls of Niagara</geogName>,<lb/> whose
                    thunders, for several days, had with awful-<lb/>ness reached mine ears. When I
                    approached this<lb/> tremendous cataract, it truly appeared amazing, and<lb/>
                    with the voice of thunder, proclaimed the majesty<lb/> of its sublime Architect.
                    When we came to the mar-<lb/>gin of the river below the falls,<lb/> we descended
                    the<lb/> almost perpendicular bank, by several windings,<lb/> from one rock to
                    another, and with the aid of seve-<lb/>ral Indian ladders, at length reached the
                    surface of<lb/>the water, I suppose at least one hundred and fifty<lb/>feet
                    below the summit. The irregular position of<lb/> multitudes of huge rocks, which
                    no doubt had tum-<lb/>
                    <pb n="73" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_073"/>bled from their ancient seats, made our
                    progress up<lb/> toward the pitch, rough and difficult. We found<lb/>logs,
                    pieces of canoes, &amp;c. in abundance, twelve or<lb/> fifteen feet above the
                    present level of the water —<lb/> also ducks, loons, cormorants, catfish,
                    pickerels, and<lb/> various kinds of fish and water fowl, which had<lb/> been
                    killed by the dashing of the columns of water,<lb/> tumbling off a precipice not
                    less than one hundred and<lb/> twenty feet perpendicular. The rocks and stones
                    are<lb/> mostly excellent limestone, as are the stones in the<lb/> banks for six
                    or seven miles below, where, from<lb/> every appearance, I think it is not
                    absurd to sup-<lb/>pose the falls once were, but have worn up to the<lb/>
                    present barrier, where the river makes a bend, and<lb/> the water is divided by
                    an island; though two thirds<lb/> of it, or more, pass on the north side of the
                    island. I<lb/> think it is not improbable that the lands adjoining,<lb/>derive
                    considerable advantage to vegetation, from<lb/> the misty vapors which arise,
                    and are exhaled to<lb/> the clouds, or blown by the varying winds, on the<lb/>
                    neighboring farms. Some of these are exceeding<lb/> fertile; abounding with
                    grass and grain. After spend-<lb/>ing an hour or two, almost lost in admiration,
                    we<lb/> ascended by the way we went down, and rode eight<lb/> miles to the
                    landing, where we dined at <persName key="bcanb1">Benjamin<lb/>

                    meet-<lb/>ing being appointed about five miles distant, I set<lb/> out on foot
                    to attend it. On the way, in the woods,<lb/> I looked back and at a few perches
                    distance, were<lb/> two Indians coming after me, on a trot — one of them<lb/>
                    frightfully painted from below one eye to the mid-<lb/>dle of his forehead, with
                    a vermillion red; the other<lb/> side, jet black. His cheek and chin under the
                    black,<lb/> was painted red, and the other side, under the red,<lb/> was painted
                    black. He had a tail of hair, and skins<lb/> of beasts, and birds with the
                    feathers on, which hung<lb/> down below the calves of his legs, and blew out
                    be-<lb/>hind him. He had his scalping knife in his hand.<lb/> His stature was
                    middle sized; but his visage was ex-<lb/>ceeding fierce and grim. I was quite
                    alone. I turned<lb/> sideways, and stood till he came up, I believe
                    with-<lb/>out visible emotion of fear, and accosted him thus:<lb/> Which way in
                    such a hurry? He said, Hooch king,<lb/>
                    <geogName key="buffc1">Buffaloe creek</geogName>! and passed along. I went on to the<lb/>
                    <pb n="75" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_075"/> meeting, where my companions and divers
                    Friends,<lb/> and other settlers in this new country, came, to the<lb/> number
                    of about one hundred. The meeting was<lb/> solid and satisfactory. We went to
                        <persName key="jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore</persName>'s<lb/> to dine, had a solid
                    opportunity in his family, and<lb/> went to our kind friend <persName

                    of the mighty power of Him, who created the<lb/> heavens and the earth, the seas
                    and fountains of wa-<lb/>ter. The rapids above, are about one mile square.<lb/>
                    Pleasingly grand is the prospect — the waves dash-<lb/>ing, and tumbling from

                    mass of water, dashing on the rocks<lb/> below, that it more resembles smoke

                <p>and first of the week. Last<lb/>
                    night was a solemn, awful season. The preceding<lb/> day was very warm. The
                    thermometer at eighty.<lb/> A little before sunset, the wind lulled into a
                    per-<lb/>fect calm. A dark cloud arose south westward, and<lb/> slowly
                    approached us. About midnight it came on,<lb/> with terrible wind, thunder and
                    lightning,—to a<lb/> humbling degree to me and the rest, more especially,<lb/>
                    as we had fifty barrels of gunpowder on board, and<lb/> between eighty and
                    ninety passengers, divers of<lb/> whom had been fierce warriors, both Indians
                    and <lb/><pb n="78" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_078"/> white men. Under every
                    consideration, I felt my<lb/> own righteousness as filthy rags, and dare not
                    indulge<lb/> a secret thought that it would be unjust if the schoo-<lb/>ner
                    should be blown up. I had no where to rest my<lb/> confidence, save in the
                    unspeakable mercy of Israel's<lb/> mighty God, by whose power we were
                    preserved.<lb/> The noise, and exertions of the seamen, were great.<lb/> Their
                    care and activity was as commendable, as it<lb/>was admirable. My spirit visited
                    my habitation, to<lb/> take a solemn leave of my dear companion, and
                    ten-<lb/>derly beloved children. I felt the peace it would<lb/> be, to yield up
                    life at home. I remembered, I had<lb/> been baptized into death, and brought
                    under great<lb/> awfulness, even unto tears and trembling, before I<lb/> set out
                    on this journey: and upon the whole, I was<lb/> favoured with a good degree of
                    quietness and resig-<lb/>nation. We now approached near the islands at the<lb/>
                    west end of <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>. Our captain lowered
                    sail,<lb/> and stood eastward till morning, then put about and<lb/> passed the
                    first island about noon. The wind very<lb/> unstable, frequent squalls succeeded
                    by little breezes<lb/> and calms. In the afternoon, came in sight of nine<lb/>

                <p>A fair wind — stemmed the heavy current<lb/>
                    eighteen miles up <geogName key="detror">Detroit river</geogName> to the
                    garrison. Ma-<lb/>ny plantations are on both sides of the river, mostly<lb/>
                    occupied by French people. On our arrival, I went<lb/> with three other Friends,
                    to the citadel, to produce<lb/> our passport from <persName key="gsim">Governor

                <p> Here are fine banks, well improved. The oldest<lb/> orchards appear luxuriant —

                    streams<lb/> with falls: being obliged to have recourse to wind-<lb/>mills to
                    manufacture their grain. Of these mills<lb/> they have a number in sight. The

                <p>Held a conference with <persName
                        key="cjohn1">Capt. John</persName> and se-<lb/>veral other Indian chiefs and
                    principal men; in<lb/> which our peaceable mission was more fully
                    explain-<lb/>ed, than heretofore. Notwithstanding our disinter-<lb/>ested, and
                    universal principles of love and good will<lb/> to mankind, we are sensible our
                    path is narrow, and<lb/> our situation delicate--the eyes of four different
                    in-<lb/>terests being open towards us;— British, United<lb/> States, Indians,
                    and the reputation of our religious<lb/>society.</p>
                <p>This afternoon, walked three miles down the west<lb/>side of <geogName
                        key="detror">Detroit river</geogName>, to a spring, at which I was
                    re-<lb/>freshed, not having drank any other than river wa-<lb/>ter for ten days.
                    On our route to the spring, we<lb/> called at a French house, to keep out of a
                    gust of<lb/> rain. The family appeared polite, loving, and pleased<lb/> to see
                    us. On our return, we called to see an old<lb/> noted Indian trader, <persName
                        key="iwill2">Isaac Williams</persName>, who is well ac-<lb/>quainted with
                    the Indian affairs, and their disposi-<lb/>tions. He related many alarming
                    circumstances of<lb/> Indian cruelty; and said they were at present more<lb/>
                    haughty and insolent, than heretofore. He rehear-<lb/><pb n="80" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_080"/> sed an
                    instance of a riot which happened that day<lb/>week, with a violent party of
                    Indians: in which he<lb/>interfered, to prevent murder, but he got
                    wounded<lb/>in the arm, with a scalping knife. He insinuated<lb/>doubts of our
                    ever returning from <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>, unless<lb/>the
                    commissioners submitted to the Indian demands,<lb/> which were very high. These
                    were also the senti-<lb/>ments of divers persons acquainted with Indians, in
                    <lb/>this place. All which conspired to our deep humi-<lb/>liation, and
                    dependance on the Omnipotent Arm,<lb/> having none other to lean to.</p>
                <p>We frequently meet Indians here, where they get<lb/>too much strong drink; in
                    which state they discover<lb/>a very alarming, and disagreeable ferocity.
                    Here,<lb/> are divers persons who have been prisoners amongst<lb/> them, some of
                    whom recite shocking accounts of<lb/>their cruelty, in many instances; others
                    speak more<lb/> favourably of their treatment. However, upon the<lb/> whole,
                    under all the circumstances of the approach-<lb/>ing treaty, it evidently
                    appears a serious business; and<lb/> little, if any thing, short of offering up
                    life, by those<lb/>who attend it. We have hitherto found very few of<lb/> the
                    natives, who have any knowledge of Friends, or<lb/>their principles.</p>
                <p>This evening we met <persName key="cengl1">Col. England</persName>, and a
                    number<lb/> of the officers, on the bank of the river; with whom<lb/>we had
                    considerable conversation; in which, I hope,<lb/>we acknowledged, and supported
                    the peaceable prin-<lb/>ciples of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour
                    Jesus<lb/>Christ. They treated us on every occasion, like<lb/>gentlemen, in
                    their way, — polite, and courteous to<lb/>strangers, at least to us. <persName
                        key="cengl1">Col. England</persName> told us, he<lb/>had with much pains,
                    and expense, procured more<lb/>than fifty prisoners from the Indians, clothed
                    them,<lb/><pb n="81" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_081"/> and forwarded them homeward; many of whom
                    dis-<lb/>covered little sense of gratitude for the kindness;<lb/> yet he felt a
                    reward, as being the friend of humanity.<lb/> At night, returned to <persName
                        key="mdols">Matthew Dobson</persName>'s, where we<lb/> have taken
                    lodgings.</p></div>

                <p>Had a solid conference with <persName
                        key="dkenn1">David Kenne-<lb/>dy</persName>, a half Indian, a man of
                    learning, and a man of<lb/>influence; having been educated in Scotland, he
                    visit-<lb/>ed London, Jamaica, &amp;c. He lives with the Indians,<lb/> and
                    professes christianity; is well versed in the Scrip-<lb/>tures, and says he has
                    initiated divers into the Chris-<lb/>tian faith, by a medium widely contrasted
                    with our<lb/> mode. He told us, some Indians used to mock and<lb/> ridicule his
                    going to church; but at a certain time,<lb/> he undertook to drub them severely,
                    and ordered<lb/> them and their families to attend church in future,<lb/> or he
                    would be under the necessity of dealing more<lb/> sharply with them. On which,
                    they appeared the<lb/> next day of public worship, and had continued
                    stea-<lb/>dy ever since; he supposed it the most substantial<lb/> method of
                    making converts, as also of ending quar-<lb/>rels or disputes. To all which I
                    opposed several<lb/> texts out of the New Testament; to the validity of
                    <lb/>which he assented, and strongly avowed his friend-<lb/>ship for us, and
                    promised to use his influence, in or-<lb/>der to open our way amongst the other
                    nations of<lb/> his acquaintance, which is extensive.</p>
                <p> We had to dine with us, a religious Dunker and his<lb/> wife, settlers hereaway,
                    with whom we had fellow-<lb/>ship. They felt near to us; which I believe was
                    re-<lb/>ciprocal. In the afternoon, we had a visit from <persName key="cjohn1"
                        >Capt.<lb/> John</persName>, <persName key="ypete1">Young Peter</persName>, and
                    another Indian; to whom<lb/>we read Friends' address, with which they
                    express-<lb/>ed satisfaction, renewed their professions of friend-<lb/><pb
                        n="82" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_082"/>ship, and wanted a copy of our epistle,
                    which we<lb/> waived, until the general assemblage at the great<lb/> Council. In
                    the evening, had a visit from two re-<lb/>spectable, intelligent British
                    officers, who behaved<lb/> with politeness and civility.</p></div>

                <p>Had an interview with <persName key="celli1"

                    has been, for several weeks, enga-<lb/>ged with numerous tribes of Indians, in
                    their coun-<lb/>cils at the rapids of <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>,
                    preparatory to the great<lb/> Council. <persName key="celli1">Elliott</persName>
                    has great influence with the mid-<lb/>dle hostile nations of Indians, and being
                    an intelli-<lb/>gent person, and I thought, well disposed, might be<lb/>
                    extensively useful in promoting the desirable work<lb/> of general peace. We
                    suggested to him, as the sup-<lb/>plies for the treaty came through his hands,
                    to guard<lb/> against spirituous liquors being furnished. To the<lb/> propriety
                    of which, as well as to divers other re-<lb/>marks, he assented. We received an
                    invitation to dine<lb/> with the British officers at the mess house
                    to-morrow.<lb/> Through the variety of company and visiters, my<lb/> mind is
                    preserved in a quiet, humble hope, that the<lb/> Lord is preparing our way.</p>
                <p>Here I met with a Quebec Calendar, wherein was<lb/> inserted the names,

                    the Squaws and<lb/>others, with tails of wild beasts passing over the top<lb/>
                    of their heads, and hanging down their backs. But<lb/> my genius, pen, and even
                    imagination in its strong-<lb/>est picturesques, must fall short of the
                    shocking,<lb/> striking, curious prospect of these northern inhabi-<lb/>tants of
                    the wilderness. They had drunk rum to<lb/> excess, before we reached them.
                    Several were much<lb/> disguised. The more sober shook hands, and ap-<lb/>peared
                    friendly, to whom I gave a small present.<lb/> Yet two very stout, grim,
                    middle-aged men, were<lb/> raised into rage and anger at us, loudly saying
                    —<lb/> shemochteman! shemochteman! I said no; not she-<lb/>mochteman — brothers,
                    from <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. At which<lb/> they rose
                    higher, and more clamorous. We found<lb/> they could understand little or none
                    of our conver-<lb/>sation. Some of the young Indians, meanwhile,<lb/> were
                    singing the hair off a small animal over a fire,<lb/> preparing for breakfast.
                    We conjectured it to be a<lb/> puppy.</p>
                <p>My heart felt exceeding sorrowful, and the lan-<lb/>guage of my soul was, how
                    much owest thou unto<lb/> thy Lord! The picture of these poor degraded
                    ani-<lb/>mals in human shape, involved many serious consi-<lb/>derations
                    respecting their approaching Council; where <lb/><pb n="87"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_087"/> would probably be many hundreds, more wild
                    and<lb/> ferocious than these. My mind was covered with<lb/> lamentation
                    respecting the cause of such degrada-<lb/>tion, which, at least in part, appears
                    to arise from<lb/> abandoned and profligate white people having the<lb/>
                    greatest intercourse with them in their trade, and<lb/> towns; to which,
                    stimulated by the love of money,<lb/> they resort, at the risk of their lives —
                    carrying their<lb/> vices, immoralities, and bad example with them.<lb/> These,
                    the poor uncultivated Indians easily imbibe;<lb/> and, taking root in a soil,
                    adapted to receive evil<lb/> seed, produce fruit, dreadful to behold.</p>
                <p>The greatest discouragements attending from day<lb/> to day respecting the
                    desired peace, arise from a<lb/> query or doubt, that a neglect of religious
                    duty to-<lb/>wards these poor people in earlier time, might be<lb/> rewarded by
                    a continuance of unrelenting, savage<lb/> chastisement on our borders, from the
                    old inhabitants<lb/> of the land; whose murderous practices and their<lb/> cruel
                    instruments of death, and engines of destruc-<lb/>tion, I tremble to relate —
                    such as rifles, bayonets,<lb/> scalping knives, and tomahawks of brass and
                    steel;<lb/> and the bodies of some almost covered over with<lb/> silver, tin and
                    other plates, broaches, bobs, &amp;c. as<lb/> hostile ensigns. In all which, may
                    I not say with<lb/> sorrow and blushing, they have been equalled, if<lb/> not
                    exceeded, by the professed followers of the meek<lb/> and humble Jesus, whose
                    holy kingdom and divine<lb/> law suffer violence arid depression, to a
                    mournful<lb/> degree.</p>
                <p>This day, we dined at the mess house, with about<lb/> sixteen respectable British
                    officers; all young gen-<lb/>tlemen from Great Britian and Ireland: several
                    of<lb/> whom were estated men, to a great amount. They <lb/><pb n="88"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_088"/> behaved with a modest civility, far exceeding
                    my<lb/> expectation from military characters. The enter-<lb/>tainment was
                    luxuriously sumptuous, and hospitable,<lb/> as to flesh, fish, fruit, and
                    vegetables, with variety<lb/> of wines and excellent London porter. We
                    dined<lb/> at four o'clock, and spent till near sunset in agree-<lb/>able
                    conversation, on various subjects — such as reli-<lb/>gion, governments, war,
                    peace, theatrical exhibitions;<lb/> and, at the conclusion, they begged leave to
                    drink<lb/> a toast; which, out of complaisance, they dispensed<lb/> with, except
                    the King's health. We told them we<lb/> could not encourage the practice, as it
                    frequently<lb/> proved an inlet to intemperance, and sometimes
                    in-<lb/>toxication; which they granted — nevertheless they<lb/> took the liberty
                    to drink, success to the Quakers in<lb/> the present honourable, and
                    disinterested underta-<lb/>king.</p>
                <p>After night, a lad named <persName key="dfraz1">Daniel Frazer</persName>, came
                    to<lb/> our lodgings. He told us he was taken prisoner by<lb/> the Indians, out
                    of Russell county in <placeName key="virgi">Virginia</placeName>. Here<lb/> came
                    also, <persName key="jhenr1">James Henry</persName>, a smart young man, a
                    pri-<lb/>soner with the <persName key="blind">Blind Chief</persName>, near the
                    mouth of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="rouger">river Roosh</geogName>, twelve miles from <placeName
                        key="detro">Detroit</placeName>. He is adopt-<lb/>ed; which renders his case
                    difficult. They have put<lb/> jewels in his nose and ears, and figured him like
                    an<lb/> Indian. He is desirous of returning to his relations<lb/> near
                        <placeName key="geort">Georgetown</placeName>, Eastern Shore of Maryland.
                    In<lb/> this house is hired a young woman, whose name is<lb/> Field, taken from
                    Ohio, below <placeName key="fpitt1">Fort Pitt</placeName>, where her<lb/> father
                    lived when she was taken. We have met<lb/> with divers others, whose cases
                    excite sympathy<lb/> and concern, and to which attention has been paid;<lb/> but
                    we thought it most prudent not to make strenuous<lb/> exertions at present, lest
                    it might operate to our dis-<lb/><pb n="89" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_089"/>advantage
                    at the treaty, in procuring the enlarge-<lb/>ment of prisoners more
                    generally.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-15">15th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p><persName key="apark1">Abiah Park</persName>
                    came to see us. He is a trader<lb/> with the Indians. He entertains doubts of a
                    peace;<lb/> yet says, if one can be made, it will be permanent.<lb/> This
                    forenoon felt easy to appoint a meeting, to be-<lb/>gin at ten o'clock
                    to-morrow, at a shop in the ship-<lb/>yard, under the direction of <persName
                        key="wbak">William Baker</persName>, a Friend<lb/> in principle, and cousin
                    to <persName key="gbake1">George Baker</persName> of <placeName key="phila"
                        >Phila-<lb/>delphia</placeName>.</p>
                <p>In the evening several Indians of the <orgName
                        key="wyandot">Wyandot<lb/> tribe</orgName> came to our lodgings
                    to see us. They live<lb/>about twenty miles from this place, at a town called<lb/>
                    <placeName key="mongu">Mogogam</placeName>. One <persName key="ssand1">Samuel
                        Sanders</persName>, a Scotchman, who<lb/> lives with them, interpreted. They
                    told us they<lb/>had heard their fathers say, the Quakers were hon-<lb/>est, and
                    never wronged them; and they hoped we<lb/> would stand for justice, and not see
                    them wronged,<lb/> at the treaty. We informed them we came in love to<lb/> see
                    them, and to renew old friendship; that the power<lb/> did not lay with us — but
                    we believed the commis-<lb/>sioners were sincerely disposed for peace.
                    There<lb/> also came to our lodgings, a party of the <orgName
                        key="ojibwe">Chipawas</orgName> —<lb/> an old chief and several
                    warriors, one of whom had<lb/> a human scalp, with beautiful fair curled hair on
                    it,<lb/> tied to his ear. These were some of those, who, a<lb/> day or two
                    before, had treated us so roughly. A<lb/> white man who stood near us at that
                    time, and un-<lb/>derstood their language, told us they had a desire<lb/> to
                    have our scalps. They appear to be a terrible<lb/> nation, fierce, insolent and
                    warlike; and, I believe,<lb/> exceedingly injured by their intercourse with
                    the<lb/> white people, especially the French, many of whom<lb/> are little more
                    refined than they. Their almost in-<lb/><pb n="90" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_090"/>
                    cessant importunity for rum, made the interview not<lb/> so agreeable. We mostly
                    evaded giving them liquor,<lb/> and substituted pipes and tobacco, to put them
                    off.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-16">16th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>First of the week. Went to meeting,
                    where<lb/> a large number of the inhabitants of the town, and<lb/> military men,
                    assembled. I believe it was a solid<lb/> season, and truth's testimony was
                    exalted over all<lb/> opposition; notwithstanding rawness and dark
                    in-<lb/>sensibility were painfully prevalent. We came to<lb/> our lodgings, and
                    dined with two <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName>
                    chiefs,<lb/> who had been to see us the preceding evening. —<lb/> They behaved
                    with decency at table, equal to any<lb/> of us; handled their knife and fork
                    well, eat mode-<lb/>rately, drank two glasses of wine, and through the<lb/>
                    whole, conducted with a decorum that would do ho-<lb/>nour to hundreds of white
                    people. We afterwards<lb/> went down the river in <persName key="cengl1">Col.
                        England</persName>'s boat, about<lb/> six miles, to the house of <persName
                        key="jpowe1">Judge Powell</persName>, where we<lb/> had appointed a meeting.
                    The <persName key="jpowe1">Judge</persName> and his fami-<lb/>ly being gone to
                    England, his steward had kindly<lb/> offered his house. A considerable number
                    conve-<lb/>ned, and I was comforted in a belief that the ever-<lb/>lasting
                    gospel was preached in Canada. After which<lb/> we returned to our lodgings.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-17">17th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>This morning there were many
                    unfavour-<lb/>able reports respecting the hostile dispositions of the<lb/>
                    Indians passing on to the treaty. The circumstances<lb/> of things appear very
                    critical, and alarming. Even<lb/> our personal safety is called in question, and
                    much<lb/> doubted, unless the commissioners have very exten-<lb/>sive powers. As
                    I was writing in the chamber<lb/> where I lodged, two <orgName
                        key="Wyandot">Wyandots</orgName>, much in liquor, came<lb/> up into the
                    room, and teazed me for rum. I put<lb/> them off. After some time they laughed, shook<lb/>
                    <pb n="91" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_091"/> hands and departed. At which I was glad,
                    as I was<lb/> alone. Dined with <persName key="cengl1">Capt. England</persName>,
                        <persName key="cleab1">Capt. Leaburn</persName>,<lb/>
                    <persName key="mandr1">Maj. Andrews</persName> and several other military
                    gentlemen,<lb/> and two of their ladies. They were very courteous<lb/> and
                    polite.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-09-18">18th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>We wrote a letter two days ago, in
                    order<lb/> to hasten the commissioners to come forward to this<lb/> place, being
                    more contiguous to <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>, and more<lb/> in
                    the way of information. This morning we wrote<lb/> a few lines to <persName
                        key="amcke1">Col. McKee</persName>, at the great preparative<lb/> council at
                        <geogName key="miamr1">Miami rapids</geogName>, expressive of our
                    peace-<lb/>able mission.</p>
                <p> Ten principal Indians, <orgName key="seneca"
                    >Senecas</orgName> and <orgName key="cayugaind"
                        >Cayugas</orgName>,<lb/> came to see us. Several of them old men, with<lb/>
                    gray hairs, and furrowed brows; evident marks of<lb/>a round of years, attended
                    with variety of hardships,<lb/> exercise, sorrow and pain. Their depressed
                    coun-<lb/>tenances awakened all the compassionate feelings of<lb/> my mind,
                    towards them. But my agency seemed so<lb/> feeble, I could only retire into
                    solemn quietude, and<lb/> intercede the common Father, to be the comfort
                    and<lb/> prop of their declining years. The old Fish-carrier<lb/> was one of the
                    number.</p>
                <p>This day, my exercise of mind was heavy, and<lb/> my heart sorrowful, in a
                    feeling of the sufferings of<lb/> the pure Seed in this place, and the cruelty
                    and op-<lb/>pression which reign among the children of men,<lb/> even of the
                    most polished nations. What enormous<lb/> salaries are given to military
                    officers, both sea and<lb/> land, as also to officers in civil government, who
                    too<lb/> generally stand opposed, with thousands of others<lb/> in more inferior
                    stations, to the spreading and in-<lb/>crease of the kingdom and government of
                    the Prince<lb/> of Peace. In a little interview with <persName key="cmuns1"
                        >Capt. Munsey</persName>,<lb/>
                    <pb n="92" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_092"/> a sprightly British officer, I took the
                    liberty to men-<lb/>tion the possibility, that when the broils in France<lb/>
                    should subside, the African slave trade be abolished,<lb/> and a permanent peace
                    concluded with our Ameri-<lb/>can Indians, all this globe might be at peace;
                    and<lb/> that swords (of which he had one by his side) might<lb/> be beaten into
                    ploughshares. He quickly replied,<lb/> he hoped not to see such a time, as it
                    would also<lb/> beat up his bread and butter, (meaning his living.)<lb/> Such
                    are the views of too many, in this day.</p>
                <p>A middle aged Indian, of the <orgName key="delaware"
                        >Delaware tribe</orgName>, dined<lb/> with us. He talked a little English,
                    by which we<lb/> understood he was in possession of several sheets of<lb/>
                    ancient writings; that he had heard of Friends, and<lb/> just faintly remembered
                        <persName key="zhest1">Z. Heston</persName> and <persName key="jparr1">John
                        Parrish</persName><lb/> being at their town. He said there were but
                        <persName key="bukon1">Buchon-<lb/>geholas</persName>, <persName
                        key="cpipe1">Pipe</persName>, and two other chiefs belonging to their<lb/>
                    nation; that we might depend, if they said peace, it<lb/> would be peace; but if
                    they said war, it would be<lb/> war. Also said, we would find the middle
                    tribes<lb/> more faithful and manly than the <orgName
                        key="ojibwe">Chipawas</orgName> and<lb/>
                    <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandots</orgName>; for they were
                    treacherous. I told him,<lb/> they had called us Shemochteman, or Big Knife,
                    and<lb/> said they wanted our scalps; at which he laughed.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-06-19">19th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Crossed the river, and went down the
                    east-<lb/>ern bank four miles, to the house of <persName key="jmess1">John
                        Missiner</persName>,<lb/> where we had a solemn season, with a number
                    of<lb/> his neighbours, to the contriting of the hearts of di-<lb/>vers present.

                        <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> was favoured, in an
                    extraordinary<lb/> manner. After parting with them, we walked up<lb/> the river
                    about a mile, called at the house of <persName key="fcorn1">Francis<lb/>
                        <pb n="93" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_093"/> Cornwall</persName>, and had
                    conversation with him and his<lb/> precious wife Anna, on the subjects of water
                    bap-<lb/>tism, the bread and wine, &amp;c.; which they endeavour-<lb/>ed, for a
                    while, to defend; but at length gave it up.<lb/> We likewise had a close
                    conversation with a French<lb/> militia captain, on the subject of war, which we
                    held<lb/> to be incompatible with the purity, spirit, and pre-<lb/>cepts of the
                    gospel. To the general scope of which,<lb/> he assented; but alleged, that
                    according to the oath<lb/> of allegiance to his king, when he ordered
                    martial<lb/> enterprises, he must obey; and that his king must<lb/> be
                    responsible for what was done. We silenced his<lb/> arguments; and proceeded to
                        <persName key="farno1">Frederick Arnold</persName>'s.<lb/>On the way, I went
                    to visit a man who was deranged.<lb/> He was chained in a barn. At first, he
                    would nei-<lb/>ther look at me, nor speak to me. He was sitting<lb/> down. I
                    spoke to him in the fear of the Lord, and<lb/> desired him not to be
                    discouraged; but trust in the<lb/> Lord; for he was come to seek and to save
                    that which<lb/> was lost. He then lifted up his eyes, and stared at<lb/> me very
                    wildly. I said, I hoped he would be bet-<lb/>ter. He said, he hoped he would. He
                    then stood<lb/> up on his feet, and said, my trust is in the Lord,<lb/> and not
                    in going into the water. I learned he had<lb/> been pressed by some zealous
                    Baptists to undergo that<lb/> operation, which he could not consent to. I
                    gave<lb/> him some further counsel, and left him. I heard,<lb/> next day he was
                    so rational as to be unchained.—<lb/> Lodged with <persName key="farno1"
                        >Frederick Arnold</persName>, a long bearded Tun-<lb/>ker, an inoffensive
                    man; but, like his brethren, and<lb/> too many others, loves money.</p></div>

                <p><persName key="jelli1">John
                        Elliott</persName> and myself walked several<lb/> miles up the river, and
                    were ferried over it in a<lb/> canoe, by a Frenchman. The river is about three-<lb/>
                    <pb n="94" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_094"/> quarters of a mile wide, opposite the
                    town. In this<lb/> excursion I made the following observations:</p>
                <p> From <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName> up to this place, is
                    eighteen<lb/> miles. Each farm is laid out about forty perches on<lb/> the river
                    — mostly improved, with houses, gardens,<lb/> and orchards; and extending back,
                    where the land is<lb/> level, and abounds with grass, and where hundreds<lb/> of
                    cattle thrive exceedingly, producing beef, butter,<lb/> cheese, veal, &amp;c. in
                    plenty. Their winters are about<lb/> four months, in which it is requisite to
                    feed stock.<lb/> The country, at present, is excellently adapted for<lb/>
                    raising live stock. The soil is mixed, and various,<lb/> clay, gravel, sand,
                    &amp;c. Here are fine fields of wheat,<lb/> and peas, but too wet for corn. Tile
                    whole country<lb/> is level, to a fault, without a stone, except on
                    islands<lb/>in the mouth of the river Croeseel, and on the banks<lb/> of the
                    lake, which are generally limestone — these<lb/> are monopolized by old Indian
                    traders, and sold to<lb/> the inhabitants, at a high rate, for the purpose
                    of<lb/> building their chimnies, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>
                    <placeName key="hogis">Hog Island</placeName> is in sight, above the garrison.
                    It<lb/> appears to be well timbered. I am told it took its<lb/> name from this
                    circumstance; being infested with<lb/> rattlesnakes to such a degree that people
                    were afraid<lb/> to enter upon it; and, as the best expedient, they<lb/>turned
                    on it a large herd of three or four year old<lb/> swine. In time, the hogs
                    destroyed the reptiles so that<lb/> it became habitable, and thence was called
                        <placeName key="hogis">Hog Island</placeName>.</p>
                <p> Large rafts of excellent timber are brought into<lb/> the king's yard, in this
                    place, from the <geogName key="thame">river Lau-<lb/>trench</geogName>; and some
                    fine masts and beams, come by<lb/> water out of <geogName key="lakeh">lake
                        Huron</geogName>, quite through <geogName key="lakst">lake St.
                        Clair</geogName>.<lb/> The changes of weather, are great and frequent<lb/>
                    here. There are no eels found in the waters, nor <lb/><pb n="95"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_095"/> rats on the land, west, or above the <geogName
                        key="niagf">great Falls of<lb/> Niagara</geogName>. Here is an abundance of
                    corn boiled in strong<lb/> lye, and made into what we call slut hominy, to
                    go<lb/> in the north-west trade, an far as a place called the<lb/> Black North,
                    said to be eighteen hundred miles dis-<lb/>tant, now in the hands of British and
                    Scotch mer-<lb/>chants. They go thither in batteaux. I saw a man<lb/> who
                    resided there three years; who says, early in<lb/> the spring they set out with
                    choice peltry, such as<lb/> beaver, otter, minks, martins, &amp;c. come to the
                    great<lb/> portage, where they are met by the batteaux from<lb/>
                    <placeName key="montr">Montreal</placeName>, exchange their load, and each
                    returns just<lb/> as winter sets in. To the north-west posts, Indians<lb/>
                    frequently come that never saw a white man before.<lb/> They are clothed in
                    buffaloe and bear skins, neatly<lb/> softened, whitened and dressed. They are
                    kind and<lb/> good natured, use bows and arrows, and have no<lb/> fire arms.
                    They cover their cabins with large rough<lb/> skins: as the merchants rarely
                    purchase even deer<lb/> skins; having such an abundance of more rich furs,<lb/>
                    that they cannot send the coarse skins forward. This<lb/> trade is rich and
                    extensive, and employs the capitals<lb/> of many merchants, both in England and
                    Canada.<lb/> The great channel of this trade is down the <geogName key="grand"
                        >Grand<lb/> river</geogName> from <geogName key="lakeh">Huron
                        lake</geogName>, to which is but a short car-<lb/>rying place. An immense
                    quantity of skins pass<lb/> this way. The whole of the trade makes way for<lb/>
                    large numbers of Canadian watermen to get a living.<lb/> The wages for them, and
                    also for hands on land,<lb/> average about six pounds a month. Cows sell at
                    fif-<lb/>teen pounds a head— sheep, six dollars a piece —<lb/> veal calves,
                    twelve dollars each.</p>
                <p> The English and German farmers are likely to<lb/> alter the manner of living,
                    and customs in this place,<lb/>
                    <pb n="96" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_096"/> for the better. The old French settlers
                    in general<lb/> are poor economists, and proud withal — live mise-<lb/>rably at
                    home, yet appear grand abroad. It is said<lb/> they live much on boiled fish,
                    supping the broth with-<lb/>out either bread or salt. They are superstitiously
                    reli-<lb/>gious, going to mass more than two hundred days<lb/> in the year. They
                    have two large worship houses<lb/> here, and a number of crosses, set up on the
                    banks of<lb/> the river and other places, to evince their christianity.</p></div>

                <p>
                    Walked up the river about four miles, to
                    a<lb/> place called <geogName key="blood">Bloody Bridge</geogName>, from a
                    contest which<lb/> happened there between the British, Canadians, and<lb/>
                    Indians, where many fell. We called at a respect-<lb/>able French farmer's, who
                    took us into a curious<lb/> garden of fruit, flowers, &amp;c. also into his
                    house,<lb/> where were pictures, representing Christ on the<lb/> Cross, old
                    Saints, &amp;c. <persName key="jelli1">John Elliott</persName> talked
                    French<lb/> to them; they appeared pleased, and behaved polite-<lb/>ly. Though
                    much apparent superstition and idola-<lb/>try are indulged amongst them, yet I
                    hope many<lb/> are looking beyond it to the more substantial parts<lb/> of true
                    worship: although I have seen them after<lb/> mass, frolicking and horse racing
                    in the road pass-<lb/>ing the worship house, or as it were, at the door,<lb/>
                    the remaining part of the day, to their reproach.<lb/> The buildings on the
                    banks of the river, though low,<lb/> being mostly a story and a half, are
                    beautiful, and<lb/> the farms fertile — but their fuel and rails are all to<lb/>
                    be drawn about four miles. On our return, we fell<lb/> in with several <orgName
                       key="ojibwe">Chipawa</orgName> camps — they had
                    tents of<lb/> mats curiously wrought of flags, reeds, rushes, &amp;c.<lb/> Their
                    canoes were made of bark, with great skill and<lb/> ingenuity.</p></div>

                <p>
                    First-day. Had a meeting in the
                    sail-loft,<lb/> with a considerable number of people. It was a time<lb/>of
                    stripping and heavy exercise; yet I trust the gos-<lb/>pel testimony did not
                    suffer reproach. A number of<lb/> Indians came to see us, and behaved civilly.
                    One<lb/> said, he was glad at his heart to see us.</p></div>

                    Air cold and chilly. This forenoon a
                    wolf<lb/> was brought to the wharf, which was shot on <placeName key="hogis"
                        >Hog<lb/> Island</placeName>. It is said to have been floated there
                    from<lb/> the main land last winter on a cake of ice. Since<lb/> which time he
                    has killed sixty pigs. The owner of<lb/> the island advertised twenty dollars
                    for his head.<lb/> A half Indian shot him. He was higher than any<lb/> dog I
                    ever saw, and his teeth larger and stronger<lb/> than a mastiff's. He was about
                    six feet long from<lb/> the end of the nose to the feet or paws of the hind<lb/>
                    legs — of a grayish colour, short, broad ears, and a <lb/>long hairy, but not
                    bushy, tail. </p>
                <p> This morning we received account, that a compa-<lb/>ny of <orgName
                        key="ojibwe">Chipawa Indians</orgName> who had got too much
                    rum,<lb/> differed in their tent on the commons. Two of them<lb/> attacked a
                    third, and stabbed him to death with their<lb/> knives. A sorrowful instance of
                    the shocking, hor-<lb/>rid effects of this man-bane, (distilled spirits.) This
                    <lb/><pb n="98" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_098"/> has been the great engine, and mainspring, which<lb/>has
                    prepared the way and led to thousands of acts of<lb/>hostility, and murders
                    without number. It has evi-<lb/>dently appeared to me, to be the greatest
                    obstacle in<lb/> the way of the civilization and happiness of the In-<lb/>dian
                    natives — the removal of which, loudly calls for<lb/> the united exertions of
                    our Government, and that of <lb/>Great Britian, together with the unremitting
                    endea-<lb/>vours of all Christians, and lovers of mankind. I<lb/>consider this
                    important object of so great magnitude,<lb/> as hardly to be equalled by any
                    terrestrial achieve-<lb/>ment. Oh! that legislators would lay it more
                    deep-<lb/>ly to heart, and the professed followers of Jesus,<lb/> lift up a glorious
                    ensign against this mighty destroy-<lb/>er of mankind! Instead of which, sorrow
                    is now<lb/>added to affliction, until blood touches blood, by<lb/> furbished
                    swords, harnessed men and horses, glitter-<lb/>ing spears, sounding drums and
                    trumpets — while<lb/>elated captains, colonels, and generals, glorying
                    in<lb/>their multitude and their pomp, forget that "Tophet<lb/>is ordained of
                    old" for those, and that they should<lb/> descend into it — forgetting also “the
                    sword that is<lb/> bathed, and that shall come upon the mountains of<lb/>Idumea"
                    — forgetting too, the God of armies, who is<lb/>able, by the diminutive fly or
                    worm, to lay the glory<lb/> and pomp of all nations in the dust — nor
                    consider-<lb/>ing that it is righteousness which exalteth a nation.</p>
                <p>This town is piquetted all round. It consists of<lb/>about one hundred and fifty
                    houses, crowded togeth-<lb/>er. The fort lays adjoining the town, on the
                    north<lb/> side. Watchmen are placed at four gates leading<lb/>into the town;
                    sentinels also stand on the ramparts<lb/> and bastions of the fortifications,
                    who cry from one<lb/> to another, every fifteen minutes, from nine in the<lb/>
                    <pb n="99" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_099"/> evening, to three o'clock in the morning, <emph rend="italic">all
                        is well</emph>,<lb/> and the last cries, <emph rend="italic">all is very
                        well</emph>. But it appeared<lb/> a superficial sound to me. This day we
                    dined at<lb/> W.F.'s, which I think nothing could have induced<lb/>us to
                    attempt, but the remembrance of our great Ex-<lb/>ample being a friend of
                    sinners. The old man treat-<lb/>ed us with generous hospitality, which we
                    requited<lb/> with plain dealing.</p></div>

                <p>Twenty-eight Indians arrived to-day, from<lb/>

                    of the most<lb/>respectable merchants in this place. We were en-<lb/>tertained
                    in a pleasing manner. His wife is a French<lb/> woman, of an amiable, easy,
                    graceful deportment.<lb/> We had the company of <persName key="dwrig1">Dr.law

                    young girl, and others. Our topics were, re-<lb/>signation and dependence on

                    spi-<lb/>ritual and temporal blessings. The origin of the<lb/>Indians, with
                    remarks on many traces of antiquity<lb/> found in the wilderness. From all
                    which, with<lb/>their sacrifices; observations of moons; care for

                    many tribes, — the probability, and<lb/>almost certainty, was inferred, of their
                    being the<lb/>dispersed tribes of Israel; and therefore, from Scrip-<lb/>ture
                    testimony and prophecy (some part of which<lb/>was fulfilled, which strongly
                    corroborated that which<lb/> yet remained) it was inferrible that they would
                    be<lb/> restored, — not to a Jewish, ceremonious Israel, but to<lb/>a spiritual
                    Israel of the circumcision, made without<lb/><pb n="100"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_100"/> hands. It was also urged, that it was our duty
                    to<lb/>use endeavours to promote, and pray for this, in pre-<lb/>ference to
                    effecting their extermination. For which<lb/> purpose, many dark and diabolical
                    machinations are<lb/> proposed; one of these I had recently heard of, viz.<lb/>
                    To take a large quantity of liquor, of which they<lb/> are extremely fond, and
                    infuse the strongest poison<lb/> therein: take it into an army which should
                    make<lb/> feint shows, until the body of them should be col-<lb/>lected, then
                    make a sham battle, and retreat with<lb/> precipitation, leaving the liquor
                    behind. The sub-<lb/>ject was closely combated, and I thought, ended in<lb/>
                    favor of the cause of injured humanity.</p>
                <p>After our interview closed, three of us walked out<lb/> to speak to the <orgName
                       key="ojibwe">Chiapas</orgName>, lately arrived. We
                    met<lb/> five or six of them; but they could not understand<lb/> us, neither we
                    them, only this much, Chemochte-<lb/>man, Bostone. I offered my hand to them
                    repeat-<lb/>edly, as also did <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName>,
                    which they as often<lb/> refused. They had come down the lakes four
                    hun-<lb/>dred miles; which shows how wide and deep the<lb/> prejudice against
                    our citizens has extended.</p></div>

                    several<lb/> other officers, who continue very respectful to us.</p>
                <p>From this place, many hundreds of bushels of<lb/> hominy, go yearly to <geogName
                        key="mackr">McInoi</geogName>, from whence it is<lb/> forwarded to the
                        <placeName key="grandp">Grand Portage</placeName>; there it is parceled<lb/>
                    out at one bushel to a man — who is more prudent<lb/> than to use one grain in

                    thou-<lb/>sand miles from the <placeName key="grandp">Grand Portage</placeName>,
                    as it is to be his<lb/> main support in case of sickness, accidents, &amp;c.
                    one<lb/> whole year. But while health remains, they substi-<lb/><pb n="101"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_101"/>tute huckleberries in their season, which they
                    dry<lb/> in the smoke, to take off the insipid sweet taste —<lb/> other times,
                    wild rye is gathered and boiled — at<lb/> others, they catch large fish, boil
                    them, select the<lb/> large bones, which being pounded or beaten, are<lb/>
                    packed in the skin of some beast just taken off, to<lb/> preserve for use. They
                    kill beasts and birds, eat <lb/>the flesh and drink the blood, without either
                    bread<lb/> or salt. Thus they live.</p>
                <p> The trade is principally carried on (that is, the<lb/> labour,) by Canadians,
                    who are quite as hardy, and<lb/> almost as savage, as the Indians themselves.
                    They<lb/> are not allowed by the merchants at <placeName key="montr"
                        >Montreal</placeName>, to<lb/> take into the north-west, more than one
                    bushel, as<lb/> their canoes must be of just such a weight as two<lb/> men can
                    carry on their shoulders, and will just hold<lb/> so much, as is completely
                    filled with goods suita-<lb/>ble for Indian trade. The company has arrived
                    at<lb/> great opulence by this business. They extend it by<lb/> their accounts,
                    so far as to mix, at times, and meet<lb/> with merchants of the wilderness like
                    themselves,<lb/> employed by the Hudson Bay company. One old man<lb/> is
                    returned, whom <persName key="jaski1">John Askin</persName> says he never
                    knew<lb/> to deviate from the truth, as too many travellers do:<lb/> He says he
                    has explored those high latitudes fifty<lb/> years, and that far beyond all
                    buffaloes, bears, and<lb/> large beasts of any kind; the country there will
                    pro-<lb/>duce no kind of grain, nor large trees; but the most<lb/> fine furs,
                    the beaver, otter, and martin skins, always<lb/> selling at market for a third
                    more than middle furs.<lb/><persName key="jaski1">Askin</persName> says,
                        <persName key="ahenr1">Alexander Henry</persName> frequently tried to<lb/>

                    never<lb/> could get one ear in perfection. All which, and<lb/> abundance more

                    beings to breathe in. This evening,<lb/> had a visit from <persName key="cdrak1"
                        >Capt. John Drake</persName>, an old Guinea<lb/> trader, now a navigator on
                    these lakes, remarkable<lb/> for using no kind of drink but water; yet is a
                    healthy,<lb/> robust man. He is employed in the north-west trade,<lb/> and just
                    arrived from the Falls of <persName key="stmar">St. Mary</persName>, at the<lb/>
                    entrance into <geogName key="lakes">Lake Superior</geogName>. On this trade,
                    the<lb/>company has one topsail vessel, and a larger on the<lb/>stocks, ready to
                    launch. They navigate that lake<lb/> about four hundred miles, and some distance
                    up a<lb/> river, to the <placeName key="grandp">Grand Portage</placeName> —
                    where the goods are<lb/>taken to canoes, by about one thousand men.
                    These<lb/>canoes run, as it is supposed, at least fifteen hundred<lb/> miles,
                    west-north-west — which requires them to be<lb/> exceedingly industrious to make
                    the post before<lb/> winter — and when winter sets in a week or two<lb/> sooner
                    than common, they are frequently caught by<lb/> the way.</p>
                <p>One <persName key="amack1">McKenzie</persName>, and ten men, set out last
                    spring<lb/> was a year, from the Black, or by some called the<lb/> Grand North
                    Post, to attempt further discoveries;<lb/> they have not been heard of since. He
                    had been<lb/> out once before, for twelve months; and met with<lb/> mountains of
                    salt ice. He now expects to be out<lb/> three years. Some of these northern
                    adventurers<lb/> return, and appear as well as those who remain at<lb/> home,
                    feasting on delicacies. In short, the young<lb/> men hereaway, think themselves
                    no more accom-<lb/>plished for company or conversation, not having<lb/> taken
                    this journey, than our young gentlemen, not<lb/> having taken the tour of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>A day or two past, we had the company of five<lb/>
                    <orgName key="moraind">Moravian Indians</orgName>,
                    whose sorrowful history deeply<lb/><pb n="103" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_103"/>
                    affected us. After ninety-six of their people had<lb/>been barbarously murdered
                    at <placeName key="muski">Muskingum</placeName>, they<lb/> were terrified, and
                    driven from one place to an-<lb/>other, seven times. Their last movement was
                    to<lb/> the <geogName key="thame">river Traunch, or Thames</geogName>. They put
                    in seventy<lb/> acres of corn last year, which grew to good size,<lb/> but being
                    a little too late, was killed by the frost.<lb/> By which means, about one
                    hundred and forty men,<lb/> women, and children, are under great suffering,
                    for<lb/> want of bread. Government furnished two hundred<lb/> bushels of corn
                    for their relief, which was nearly<lb/> expended. On consideration of their
                    being as the<lb/> first fruits of Indian civilization, and are reputed<lb/> very
                    industrious; as also on consideration of the<lb/> concern of our society for the
                    natives of the land,<lb/> and the business in which we were embarked, we,<lb/>
                    on conferring together, were united in prospect,<lb/> that it would be right,
                    strangers and pilgrims as we<lb/> were, to try our credit to supply them with
                    one<lb/> hundred dollars worth of corn and flour. Which<lb/> being procured from
                        <persName key="mdols">Matthew Dolson</persName>, we furnished<lb/> them with
                    it; for which they and their missionary,<lb/>
                    <persName key="gsans1">Sensemer</persName>, appeared thankful; and I believe it
                    had a<lb/> good savour amongst the people here. We wrote<lb/>a short epistle,
                    expressive of our good wishes for,<lb/> and kind remembrance of them, and sent
                    by <persName key="swhit1">Sam.<lb/>White</persName>, <persName key="jkilb1">John

                <p>Had a visit from a <orgName
                        key="wyandot">Wyandot chief</orgName>, who ap-<lb/>peared to have
                    much concern respecting the ap-<lb/>proaching treaty — also, a remembrance of
                        former<lb/><pb n="104" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_104"/> treaties and belts. Some
                    long and broad belts, he<lb/>said they had, that were intended, not only to
                    bind<lb/> us by the hands, but clasp us by the arms, so that<lb/> no small
                    accidents should in future, be able to make<lb/> a separation. And that,
                    notwithstanding all that had<lb/> happened, the <orgName
                        key="wyandot">Wyandots</orgName> felt some of the old
                    affec-<lb/>tion to possess their breasts, and he hoped we would<lb/>find it so
                    at the general Council: but could speak for<lb/>none but themselves. We desired
                    our interpreter,<lb/>
                    <persName key="jheck1">J. Heckewelder</persName>, to assure him we possessed the
                    same<lb/>love and friendship for them, and for all other Indians,<lb/> that we,
                    or our forefathers, ever did — that our prin-<lb/>ciples had always restrained
                    us from making war<lb/>against them. But when we believed the govern-<lb/>ment
                    was disposed to make peace with them, on<lb/>principles of justice, we were
                    willing to leave our<lb/>homes and near connexions, and at a great
                    expense,<lb/>undertake a long and hazardous journey, to endea-<lb/>vour to
                    promote it, and to be present at the conclu-<lb/>ding of so good a work. On
                    delivery of which, he<lb/>said, he knew long ago we did not fight, but
                    were<lb/>for peace. He then got up, and shook hands with<lb/>Friends, then sat
                    down, and spoke in substance as fol-<lb/>lows: That as we had come a long
                    journey, and were<lb/>all preserved in health, it was evident the
                    Great<lb/>Spirit was pleased with our coming; and he hoped<lb/>some good would
                    be done, and that the Great Spirit<lb/>would bring us home in the same good
                    health, with<lb/>peace and joy. To which we replied, we were glad<lb/>of such an
                    opportunity to talk with him, and if the<lb/>great and good work of peace could
                    be effected, we<lb/>hoped we should return home with joy and peace;<lb/>which
                    was all the reward we wanted or looked for.<lb/> He asked whether it would be
                    disagreeable, if he <lb/><pb n="105" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_105"/> was to come and
                    dine with us, to which we invited<lb/>him.</p>
                <p>We were also visited this morning by <persName key="ab">Abram</persName>,<lb/>
                    <persName key="katha">Katherine</persName> his wife, <persName key="rebek"
                        >Rebekah</persName> and <persName key="mary">Mary</persName>, his
                    daugh-<lb/>ters. They live at <geogName key="miamr1">Miami Rapids</geogName>,
                    are <orgName key="mahican">Mohickons</orgName>,<lb/>and
                    appear much civilized. Also, some <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnee</orgName><lb/>women, one a widow, who, because of her
                    situation,<lb/> had taken off her bobs, jewels, and trinkets, with<lb/>which the
                    others shone with splendor, having massy<lb/>plates of silver about them, I have
                    no doubt, to an<lb/> amount that would have clothed them in silk and<lb/>velvet.
                    Had it not been for the profuse introduction<lb/>of distilled spirits amongst
                    these people, and the<lb/>frauds in consequence of it,<lb/> imposed upon them,
                    al-<lb/>so the ravages and depredations of war, with multi-<lb/>plied murders
                    and thefts, they would at this day have<lb/>been a very wealthy people in silver
                    and gold, cat-<lb/>tle and horses. But the reverse is, at present,
                    their<lb/>sorrowful situation, I fear to our condemnation. The<lb/>history of
                    their barbarity, treachery, and breach of<lb/>faith to the white people, and to
                    one another, which<lb/>we have heard rehearsed by people well
                    acquainted<lb/>with facts, since we arrived here, would be painful,<lb/>tedious,
                    and indeed too shocking to relate. These<lb/>circumstances almost stagger the
                    faith of their best<lb/>friends. Even one of the <orgName
                        key="moraind">Moravian</orgName> missionaries<lb/>said, that
                    even if peace should be concluded, it<lb/>would not last long, until they were
                    further chas-<lb/>tised. <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> asked,
                    by what means? Did<lb/>he mean the sword? It was answered, yes — not<lb/>until
                    they were convinced the United States were<lb/>too powerful for them, and able
                    to subject them. —<lb/>These being the sentiments of those who had
                    lived<lb/>long among them, solely to promote peace, and the<lb/><pb n="106"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_106"/> principles of the gospel, proved very
                    discouraging<lb/>to us. They also pronounced it impossible to in-<lb/>struct
                    them in the principles of justice, equity, and<lb/>government; which I was not
                    willing to admit.</p>
                <p> We had a visit to-day from <persName key="nwill1">Nathan Williams</persName>,
                    an<lb/> intelligent man, especially in Indian affairs, which<lb/>he has been
                    intimately acquainted with. He, in a<lb/>friendly manner, suggested fears that
                    we would be<lb/> either killed, or kept as hostages, at the ensuing<lb/>Council.
                    And truly I am not astonished at their ideas,<lb/>considering the spectacles of
                    human misery they are<lb/> almost daily presented with, and the rumors
                    they<lb/>hear — where tribes of Indian warriors have so fre-<lb/>quently passed,
                    with their disconsolate prisoners;<lb/>and with poles stuck up in the front of
                    their canoes,<lb/>some with fifteen, others with thirty scalps suspend-<lb/>ed
                    on them, in trophy of their courage and victory.<lb/>Though it must be said in
                    honour of British huma-<lb/>nity, and commendation of this government,
                    Upper<lb/>Canada, and its truly respectable and generous offi-<lb/>cers, they
                    have interfered to the relief of scores of<lb/>prisoners, and obtained their
                    redemption at a great<lb/>price. Divers of these we have met with, and
                    they<lb/>appeared as the very outcasts of England and Ire-<lb/>land, who, as
                        <persName key="cengl1">Col. England</persName>, and other officers,
                    told<lb/>me, hardly had the manners to acknowledge the<lb/>kindness, though in
                    some instances it cost one hun-<lb/>dred pounds. But in case of a real American,
                    they<lb/>never begrudged it.</p>
                <p> This has been a high day at the Roman chapel;<lb/>being canonized in honour of
                    St. Peter. They rung<lb/> the bells, and it is said, carried about the host.
                    At<lb/>ten, they assembled at the chapel in great numbers,<lb/>men, women, and
                    children. Some kneeled, and ma-<lb/><pb n="107" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_107"/>ny
                    sung aloud. I saw them through the windows,<lb/>from our lodging. Many of them
                    appeared sincere.<lb/>But oh! the clouds of lifeless ceremonies, of images,<lb/>
                    pictures, water, wine, wafers; schemes of human<lb/>policy and earthly wisdom,
                    operating as so many<lb/>veils which obscure the inshining of the rays of
                    the<lb/>sun of righteousness, darkening counsel, to a sorrow-<lb/>ful degree,
                    often amongst men in eminent stations.<lb/>Indeed, the veil of the covering,
                    spread over all na-<lb/>tions, is only destroyed in proportion as we
                    approach,<lb/>and ascend the Lord's peaceable, holy mountain, in<lb/>the purity
                    of his saints, as little children, — where,<lb/>without cloud of ceremony, or
                    mist of darkness or<lb/>unbelief, their angels do behold the face or
                    appear-<lb/>ance of their Father in heaven, — they behold his<lb/>universal
                    love, — in his pure fear, — in the awful at-<lb/>tributes of his righteous
                    judgments, — and incompre-<lb/>hensible mercies, — more than heart can think,
                    or<lb/>tongue can speak, — and, in abasement, they bow be-<lb/>fore the name of
                    the Lord Jehovah, in whom sure-<lb/>ly, is everlasting strength, and to whom, I
                    desire to<lb/>commit my cause, and commend my soul, with my<lb/>dear companion,
                    and our tender babes, if we should<lb/>never more meet in this vale of
                    tribulation.</p>
                <p> Last night, about eleven o'clock, five or six guns<lb/>went off smartly one
                    after another. The report<lb/>sounded unpleasant, especially, anticipating if
                    it<lb/>should so happen at <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>, how it
                    would pro-<lb/>bably alarm. I understand it was at some wolves,<lb/>which had
                    destroyed a neighbour's sheep.</p></div>

                    We were visited by a principal man of the<lb/>

                        <persName key="blind">Blind Chief</persName>, with his
                    nephew,<lb/>grand-son, and great-grand-son, a likely lad of twelve<lb/>years
                    old. They were well dressed, and appeared<lb/><pb n="108"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_108"/> friendly. We informed them, by an interpreter,
                    of<lb/>our friendly motives in this visit, and explained our<lb/>uniform
                    peaceable principles and practice, for more<lb/>than one hundred years; and that
                    we wished to pro-<lb/>mote peace in our country. He told us, eight of<lb/>their
                    principal men were gone to the Council at<lb/>
                    <geogName key="miamr1">Miami Rapids</geogName>, with pacific views and
                    intentions.<lb/>They took leave of us in a decent, respectable man-<lb/>ner.</p>
                <p> This day, we had two meetings in the king's sail-<lb/>loft, largely attended by
                    citizens, officers, and sol-<lb/>diers, of <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit</placeName>, which, though deeply exercising,<lb/>wading us through
                    mire, and dirt, and rubbish, yet<lb/>were to a good degree, satisfactory.</p></div>

                        key="celli1">Capt. Elliott</persName>'s: af-<lb/>terwards, attended the
                    burial of <persName key="ishon">Isidore Shone</persName>, at<lb/>the Roman
                    chapel, where the priest in his pontifical<lb/>robes, was preceded by a man
                    bearing on an ensign<lb/>like a halbert, a large cross; and attended by
                    singers,<lb/>and two little lads, each with a candle. They, with<lb/>the priest
                    and singers, were clothed in black petti-<lb/>coats, and covered over the arms
                    and shoulders with<lb/>a white surplice, which reached down to the
                    knee.<lb/>When the coffin, which was covered with a black<lb/>pall with costly
                    fringe, approached the threshold of<lb/>the chapel, the bearers made a small
                    halt, the priest<lb/>turned round with a brush in his hand, and
                    sprinkled<lb/>water on the apparatus about the deceased. I did<lb/>not go inside
                    of the house, but saw numbers of light-<lb/>ed candles burning in it; which made
                    but a feint<lb/>light, as the sun shone bright, and the day was ex-<lb/>ceeding
                    warm. Notwithstanding which, the eccle-<lb/>siastical part of the procession
                    went bare-headed,<lb/> and very slow, muttering, or rather growling, a
                        sen-<lb/><pb n="109" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_109"/>tence or two of Latin, over
                    and over, all the way.<lb/>Indeed the whole of this religious parade,
                    appeared<lb/>to have more of Jewish ceremony, or Gentile super-<lb/>stition in
                    it, than Christian simplicity or gravity. —<lb/>They deposited the poor
                    tabernacle under the floor,<lb/> rung the bells, sung aloud, made their sanctum
                    sanc-<lb/>torum resound, and then departed. Numbers of them<lb/>come to mass on
                    first-day, eight or ten miles, just<lb/> step in, and (they say) rhyme over
                    their paternoster,<lb/>dip their finger into the font, cross themselves,
                    and<lb/>out again, to drink and frolic.</p></div>

                <p>
                    I went on board the Ottoway, <persName
                        key="ccow">Capt. Cowan</persName>,<lb/> just arrived from <placeName
                        key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>, in hopes of hearing from<lb/>home; in
                    which I was disappointed. I found eigh-<lb/>teen <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneida Indians</orgName> on board, with whom I
                    had<lb/> some conversation. The captain informed me, he<lb/> had put sixty on
                    shore at the mouth of the <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>,<lb/> on their
                    way to the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, where, we are
                    inform-<lb/>ed, twelve hundred Indians are assembled. This<lb/>day we received a
                    letter from <persName key="amcke1">Colonel McKee</persName>, con-<lb/>taining
                    friendly sentiments, and an assurance that<lb/>we should have timely notice of
                    the opening of the<lb/>treaty. We also received one from a young man
                    on<lb/>board the Chipaway, informing that <persName key="cbutl1">Colonel
                        Butler</persName>,<lb/> who was passenger with his Indians on board
                        <persName key="ccow">Capt.<lb/> Cowan</persName>'s vessel, came on board
                    their vessel, and in<lb/>conversation in a select company, where he had no<lb/>
                    suspicion, expressed, that if the commissioners should<lb/>propose, or even hint
                    any other terms than what<lb/>were concluded upon by the Indians, he would
                    not<lb/>think it strange, if every person from the colonies,<lb/>comissioners,
                    Quakers, and all, should be sacrificed<lb/>on the spot; for they know no
                    distinction, but their<lb/>own people. This, the young man communicated to
                        <lb/><pb n="110" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_110"/> us out of pure friendship,
                    having heard it himself:<lb/>which we treasured up at present. But truly,
                    the<lb/> pressure of murdering, dark, blood-thirsty spirits,<lb/>from day to
                    day, is exceeding heavy; always re-<lb/>quiring us to watch and pray, that we
                    may be fur-<lb/>nished with the whole armour of light.</p></div>

                    <persName key="cengl1">Col.
                        England</persName> came to visit us. We went to<lb/>see his garden — in the

                    often<lb/> as we wished, to retire into his arbours in the heat<lb/>of the day.
                    We acknowledged his kindness, and<lb/> went to our lodgings to dine, where we
                    had the<lb/>company of a young <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnese</orgName> chief. He was neat-<lb/>ly dressed in Indian style. I
                    computed he had, at<lb/>least, one thousand silver broaches stuck on a
                    new<lb/>silk hunting shirt. He behaved at table with great<lb/>gentility.</p></div>

                <p>Fourteen Indians came to see us. They
                    ap-<lb/>peared friendly. The weather exceeding warm. Al-<lb/>though we are well
                    supplied with provisions, yet,<lb/>the water being all brought from the river,
                    and<lb/>standing in a tierce in the sunshine, makes our drink<lb/>disagreeable.
                    This, with a host of flies by day, and<lb/>fleas and bugs by night, added to our
                    state of sus-<lb/>pense, required some fortitude and patience to keep<lb/>our

                    the wilderness at the time they<lb/><pb n="111" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_111"/>
                    were, fourteen years ago. Such a situation, contrast-<lb/>ed with a land of
                    peace, and the security of life,<lb/>liberty, and property, may enable us to
                    make some<lb/>estimate of the blessings we enjoy, and the princi-<lb/>ples which
                    lead to a permanent security of them.</p>
                <p> This morning the Ottoway, <persName key="ccow">Capt. Cowan</persName>,
                    sailed<lb/> for <placeName key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>, to go by the way

                        key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>. With whom <persName key="celli1">Capt.

                    join<lb/> McKee at the council. We acquainted him repeat-<lb/>edly with our

                    business in<lb/>agitation, and engaged him to use his influence as<lb/>speedily
                    as possible, to open the way for a treaty. I<lb/>sent by this vessel some
                    intelligence to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/>and sailed
                    up the river past <placeName key="hogis">Hog Island</placeName> and <geogName

                    long, and eighteen broad.<lb/>After taking a prospect of <geogName key="gross"
                        >Gross Point</geogName>, the residence<lb/>of <persName key="cgran1"

                    eight or<lb/>nine miles to our lodgings. <persName key="wsave1">William

                    Hartshorn</persName>, in our absence, were visited by<lb/> a <orgName
                       key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName> warrior, who
                    announced to them what had<lb/>before been frequently suggested to us by divers
                    per-<lb/>sons, that if the commissioners did not immediately<lb/>agree, that all
                    the land west of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, should
                    be<lb/>evacuated, and given up by the United States, or<lb/>even hinted any
                    thing to the contrary, by offering<lb/>gifts or money as purchase, of which they
                    under-<lb/>stood they had brought abundance with them, that<lb/>none of them, or
                    their company, would ever go off<lb/>the ground alive — for their fathers, who
                    are now all<lb/><pb n="112" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_112"/>gone, had sold lands for
                    knives, broaches, and rum, till<lb/>they were now driven almost to the
                    sun-setting, where<lb/>they were determined to make a stand. He com-<lb/>plained
                    of the ruinous consequences of the introduc-<lb/>tion of spirituous liquors
                    amongst their fathers, say-<lb/>ing, at first, they called it bitter water, and
                    some,<lb/>fiery water. But by repeated offers of it to them,<lb/>they at length
                    fell in with it, to their hurt in gene-<lb/>ral. He also informed, that four
                    days before he left<lb/>the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, a
                    deputation of two chiefs of each nation<lb/>had embarked to meet the
                    commissioners at <placeName key="niaga">Niaga-<lb/>ra</placeName>, to let them
                    know the outlines of their conclusions,<lb/>and that if the white people would
                    settle to the banks<lb/>of <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, on the east
                    side, and agree that the river<lb/>should be the line, they would be glad, and
                    take them<lb/>by the hand, and call them brothers. All which intel-<lb/>ligence,
                    he said, might be depended on as true. Our<lb/>apprehensions that the
                    commissioners were vested<lb/> with no such powers, and that the government
                    had<lb/>no such intentions, tended to thicken the cloud which<lb/>seems
                    impending over this land; as the seeds of de-<lb/>struction are sowing in a
                    soil, prepared to produce<lb/>shocking scenes.</p>
                <p>This same Indian, getting raised with strong drink<lb/>in the afternoon, made a
                    stroke with his tomahawk<lb/>at one <persName key="sash1">Sylvester
                        Ash</persName>, an interpreter, who had long<lb/>resided with the <orgName
                       key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>; <persName
                        key="sash1">Ash</persName>’s exertions pre-<lb/>vented his killing him; he
                    then knocked off our<lb/>landlord's hat, who struck him several hard
                    blows,<lb/>and turned him out of the house. <persName key="cmuns1">Capt.
                        Munsey</persName>,<lb/>being present, sent for two soldiers, who put
                    him<lb/>out of the garrison. He was much enraged. Upon<lb/>the whole, all things
                    conspire to increase the gloom,<lb/><pb n="113" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_113"/>and
                    assure us that nothing short of wisdom from on<lb/>high will do for us to lean
                    to.</p></div>

                    con-<lb/>sideration, how the way may open in this dark land,<lb/>to lift up our
                    testimony for the excellency of the<lb/>government of Christ, our Redeemer, in
                    these hea-<lb/>then regions of both white and red people. The<lb/>Felicity is

                    deputation being<lb/>gone to meet the commissioners at <placeName key="niaga"
                        >Niagara</placeName>, accom-<lb/>panied by <persName key="cbutl1">Col.

                    First of the week. Held a meeting in
                    the<lb/>sail-loft, which was in a good degree comfortable<lb/>and satisfactory.
                    Just arrived from the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, <persName
                        key="cjohn1">Capt.<lb/>John</persName>, <persName key="dkenn1">David
                        Kennedy</persName>, and <persName key="mohic">Mohican Samuel</persName>,
                    by<lb/> whom we received a letter from <persName key="haupa1">Capt.
                        Hendricks</persName>,<lb/>importing, twenty nations were then assembled;
                    that<lb/>there were runners sent to bring forward the <orgName
                        key="potaw">Poto-<lb/>watomie</orgName> chiefs; that in a
                    few days, they should move<lb/>to <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>,
                    and that a desire for peace was gaining<lb/>ground amongst them. This account,
                    from a man<lb/>in whom we had confidence, was encouraging to us.</p>
                <p> In the afternoon, we held a meeting for worship<lb/>at a mill, at the <geogName
                        key="rouger">river Ruzche</geogName>, about five miles from<lb/><placeName
                        key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, with a considerable number of middle
                    aged<lb/> and young people, to the peace of our minds. Re-<lb/>turned in the
                    evening, they having sent up horses<lb/>to bring us down and carry us back.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-08">8th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Had an interview with <persName key="dkenn1"
                        >David Kennedy</persName>, a<lb/>learned, intelligent man, just returned
                    with <persName key="cjohn1">Capt.<lb/>John</persName> from the <geogName
                        key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>. He informs, there are a nu-<lb/>merous host
                    of Indians there, and that the general<lb/>sentiments were looking towards
                    peace; yet the<lb/>young <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnese</orgName> were high, and rough in their<lb/><pb n="114"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_114"/>dispositions, especially the warriors. We also
                    had<lb/>an opportunity with about ten or twelve Indians of<lb/>the Six Nations,
                    desiring them to use their influence<lb/>to promote the work of peace; which
                    they appeared<lb/>to unite with.</p>
                <p> This forenoon we wrote to <persName key="haupa1">Capt. Hendricks</persName>
                    by<lb/>Samuel, also sent him some money (five dollars) for<lb/>which he wrote.
                    We have lately understood that<lb/>hostilities have commenced between the
                        <orgName key="ojibwe">Chipawas</orgName><lb/> and
                        <orgName key="sioux">Sioux of the
                    Meadows</orgName>, and <orgName key="sioux">Sioux of
                        the Woods</orgName>,<lb/>against each other. They are powerful nations.</p>
                <p> This day was another interment at the Roman<lb/>chapel, of a man, said to be one
                    hundred and fifteen<lb/>years old. It was, as usual, attended with
                    abundance<lb/>of Romish pomp and superstition. The house was<lb/>wonderfully
                    replenished with lighted candles, which,<lb/>in meridian sunshine, appeared to
                    reflect no light at<lb/> all; but rather a gloom — which is truly the case
                    with<lb/>spiritual sunshine, or gospel light. It all appeared<lb/>dark.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-09">9th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>
                    I went to visit <persName key="cengl1">Col.
                        England</persName>, where I met<lb/><persName key="bljac1">Capt. Blue
                        Jacket</persName>, a chief warrior among the <orgName
                        key="delaware">Dela-<lb/>wares</orgName>, who, it is said, was in
                    command at <persName key="gstcl1">General<lb/>St. Clair</persName>'s defeat. He
                    was dressed in scarlet, with<lb/>gold tassels, and a laced hat. A brave,
                    masculine<lb/> figure of a man. I spoke to him by an interpreter,<lb/>letting
                    him know I was one of the people called<lb/>Quakers, who were men of peace, and
                    that we were<lb/>come to try to heal, and make peace. He replied,<lb/>he had
                    heard of Quakers, and that they were harm-<lb/>less people, and did not fight.
                    He was going to<lb/><placeName key="montr">Montreal</placeName>; but had given
                    his opinion before he came<lb/>away, and hoped matters would be settled.<lb/><pb
                        n="115" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_115"/>We also had a visit to-day from several
                        <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>.<lb/>One
                    of them was a middle-aged man, the most solid<lb/>countenanced I had seen
                    amongst them. We spoke<lb/>to him by an interpreter, and let him know who<lb/>we
                    were, and what our views were in coming; and<lb/>also our apprehensions of the
                    sincerity of the go-<lb/>vernment, in the present embassy. With which
                    he<lb/>appeared pleased, and said, he heartily wished we<lb/>might get through
                    with the work of peace, that the<lb/>young and active part of the Indian nations
                    might<lb/>know what to do, as it concerned them most, as the<lb/>old ones had
                    not long to live. He said he had heard<lb/>of our people, that we did justly,
                    and did not fight,<lb/>and that he was glad to be with us. After drinking<lb/>a
                    glass or two of wine, he wished us well, and de-<lb/>parted.</p>
                <p> In my interview with <persName key="cengl1">Col. England</persName>, I was
                    pre-<lb/>sented with a sketch of the <geogName key="niagf">great
                        falls</geogName>, curiously ta-<lb/>ken by <persName key="cstee1">Capt.
                        Steel</persName>, who is an artist at such designs.<lb/>I also had an
                    account to-day, from a man employed<lb/>at the <placeName key="grandp">Grand
                        Portage</placeName>. It is nine miles over, and<lb/>three bundles of seventy
                    pounds each, is the stipula-<lb/>ted burden for each man to carry that distance.
                    But<lb/> some will carry more, and ascend and descend two<lb/>mountains on the
                    way. Two men carry the canoe<lb/>on their shoulders, until the blood will run
                    down<lb/>on green hands; but at length, the skin becomes<lb/>hard as a bullock's
                    neck, accustomed to the yoke.</p>
                <p>Thus they carry and row, over ninety carrying<lb/>places, and as many creeks,
                    puddles, little lakes,<lb/>and rivers, for more than one thousand miles
                    be-<lb/>yond the <placeName key="grandp">Grand Portage</placeName>.</p></div>

                <p><persName key="bljac1">Capt. Blue
                        Jacket</persName> came to see us. We had<lb/>a friendly interview with him.
                    He is married to a <lb/><pb n="116" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_116"/>French merchant's
                    daughter, late of this place, now<lb/>deceased. Two <orgName
                        key="cayuga">Cayugas</orgName> also visited us. But
                    we<lb/>painfully feel the want of suitable interpreters. —<lb/>Many understand
                    their language; but our sentiments<lb/>being generally peaceful, serious, and
                    religious, so<lb/>opposite to those held by persons qualified to serve<lb/>us,
                    that what they delivered, appeared to be with<lb/>shame and reluctance. This put
                    it out of our power<lb/>fully to relieve our minds. My mental powers
                    often<lb/>centred in secret intercession to the Preparer of<lb/>hearts, that the
                    travail of my spirit might be con-<lb/>veyed through such aqueducts, to their
                    advantage<lb/>and edification, as may best consist with his wisdom<lb/>and
                    power. As our minds were bowed, and patient-<lb/>ly waded under it, there
                    evidently appeared a seri-<lb/>ousness at times to impress their countenances.
                    —<lb/> Last evening we received a grateful letter from the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="moraind">Moravian Indians</orgName>.</p>
                <p> We had interviews to-day with several Indians,<lb/><orgName
                    key="munseeind">Munseys</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>, and <orgName
                        key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, to some satis-<lb/>faction.
                    They appeared pleased with our motives<lb/>in coming. This afternoon, I visited
                    a young woman<lb/>educated at <placeName key="newpo">Newport</placeName>, Rhode
                    Island. Her father's<lb/>name, <persName key="wfost1">William Foster</persName>.
                    She went from home, con-<lb/>trary to her father's will, with one Molay, an
                    offi-<lb/>cer in <persName key="gstcl1">St Clair</persName>’s army. He was
                    killed in the defeat<lb/>of <date when="1790">1790</date>, and she taken
                    prisoner by the Indians, who<lb/>kept her eleven months. She then got off, and
                    has<lb/>since lived in <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, and by her
                    conduct, evinced<lb/>that she was not thankful enough for the many
                    mer-<lb/>cies, and great deliverances wrought for her. Lat-<lb/>terly she has
                    been taken with epileptic fits, of which<lb/>she frequently has divers in a day.
                    The intervals of<lb/>health are filled with bemoanings and cries for
                        mer-<lb/><pb n="117" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_117"/>cy. Notwithstanding it
                    appeared to me to be the<lb/>chastening hand of judgment laid upon her, yet
                    my<lb/>sympathy was touched, to consider if she was my<lb/>child, poor and quite
                    destitute of friends able to<lb/>comfort her, how should I feel. Oh! saith my
                    soul,<lb/>that the multiplied mournful instances recited in the<lb/>catalogue of
                    rebellion and disobedience to parents,<lb/>might have the happy effect to induce
                    young people,<lb/>early to seek the kingdom of God, and his righteous-<lb/>ness:
                    so would they be preserved out of snares, temp-<lb/>tations, and beds of anguish
                    and sorrow, the sure<lb/>rewards of sin and disobedience.</p></div>

                <p>Dined at <gap/> Abbott’s, a Detroit
                    merchant,<lb/> with all our company, except <persName key="jmoor3">Joseph
                        Moore</persName>. Indian<lb/>affairs was the topic. In the course of the
                    conver-<lb/>sation, I felt some zeal for the testimony to arise;<lb/>under which
                    I spoke plainly to divers points, and<lb/>some persons present urged the
                    necessity of whip-<lb/>ping, or further chastising the Indians, and the
                    im-<lb/>possibility of effecting their reformation without it.</p></div>

                <p>Went down the river four miles, and
                    paid<lb/> three or four little visits to some friendly people.<lb/>This
                    afternoon, a vessel arrived from <placeName key="ferie">Fort

                    ar-<lb/>rived there, and the commissioners were returned<lb/>to <placeName
                        key="niaga">Niagara</placeName>. Which accounts, with no way opening<lb/>as
                    yet, to see the Indians at the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, and no
                    let-<lb/>ters from <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, make our

                <p>A small vessel arrived from <placeName
                        key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>,<lb/>which brought letters from my wife,
                        <persName key="mmill2">M. Miller</persName>,<lb/>brother J. L. and Jonathan
                    and <persName key="rdawe1">Rumford Dawes</persName>,<lb/>all fraught with love,
                    and instructive communication.<lb/>This was a joyous feast to my mind, and as marrow<lb/>
                    <pb n="118" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_118"/> to my bones, ministering much
                    consolation and en-<lb/>couragement, and animating with increasing
                    ferven-<lb/>cy and dedication, to encounter the difficulties of
                    our<lb/>wilderness journey, with the varied conflicts and<lb/>perils attendant
                    thereon. We also received three<lb/>general epistles, one from <persName
                        key="jpemb1">James Pemberton</persName>, one<lb/>from <persName key="jpemb2"
                        >John Pemberton</persName>, and one from <persName key="hdrin1">Henry

                    our little<lb/>band. To find and feel the help, sympathy, and<lb/>travail of the
                    spirits of our friends at home, was like<lb/>the consecrating oil to each of us.
                    This vessel also<lb/>brought a letter to us from <persName key="cpic">Col.
                        Pickering</persName>, announ-<lb/>cing the arrival of the Indian deputation,
                    just as they<lb/>were about to embark — the commissioners were re-<lb/>quested
                    to return to <placeName key="nav">Navy Hall</placeName>, to have a

                    As it was<lb/>to be a short conference, they desired our further<lb/>patience,
                    and hoped to see us in a few days. This<lb/>intelligence, after five weeks
                    suspense, was not very<lb/>pleasant.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-14">14th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>First of the week. Held a public
                    meeting<lb/>for worship in the ship-yard, which was attended by<lb/>a large
                    number of people, divers of whom are near-<lb/>ly attached to us. It was a
                    solid, quiet season. But<lb/>through ignorance of the divine principle,
                    through<lb/> their inattention to it, and want of faith in it, truth,<lb/>in
                    this Babylonish land, does not rise into that do-<lb/>minion, as I have felt it
                    in some other places.</p>
                <p>I had an opportunity of conversing with <persName key="sgirt1">Simon<lb/>
                        Girty</persName>'s wife, who seems an inoffensive woman. She<lb/>had been
                    long a prisoner amongst the Indians. She<lb/>gave an account of many of their
                    method of torture<lb/>on their enemies. She says they used frequently<lb/><pb
                        n="119" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_119"/> to speak of the Quakers in the nations,
                    as a people<lb/>that did not go to war. <persName key="celli1">Capt.

                <p>Had an interview with <persName key="celli1"
                        >Elliott</persName>; he appears<lb/>much reserved. Our anxious state of
                    suspense con-<lb/>tinues. Being apprehensive of the Indian embassy<lb/>to the
                    commissioners, preventing the proposed trea-<lb/>ty, we wrote to <persName
                        key="amcke1">Col. McKee</persName>, also a short epistle to<lb/>the Indians,
                    to be in readiness to forward by the first<lb/>opportunity.</p>
                <p>Here we observed a species of Indian slaves, call-<lb/>ed <orgName
                        key="pawnee">Pawneys</orgName>, or Punins, who are captives,
                    chiefly<lb/>taken by the <orgName key="ojibwe"
                        >Chipawas</orgName>, from the Suez, (<orgName
                        key="sioux">Sioux</orgName>) or<lb/>Pawney nations. But it is
                    sorrowful to think, that<lb/>in a British government so famed for liberty,
                    they,<lb/>and a number of the African race, are held in bon-<lb/>dage during
                    life.</p>
                <p>This day, I walked out into the woods, a mile and<lb/>a half; when my further
                    excursion was prevented<lb/>by swamps, bogs, and marshes. In my route, I
                    found<lb/>stones in divers places, such as are observed on the<lb/>margin of the
                    lake. The land in general is almost<lb/>sunk under water. My mind was strongly
                    impress-<lb/>ed with a belief, that lakes <geogName key="lakeh"
                    >Huron</geogName>, <geogName key="lakst">St. Clair</geogName>, <geogName
                        key="lakee">Erie</geogName>, and<lb/><geogName key="lakem"
                        >Michigan</geogName> were once united, and the tens of thou-<lb/>sands of
                    acres, of low adjacent land, were all over-<lb/>flowed. By the breaking and
                    wearing away of the<lb/><geogName key="niagf">great falls</geogName>, as
                    mentioned before, the water has lower-<lb/>ed to the present surface: and as
                    cultivation increases,<lb/>I have no doubt, the country will be improved by
                    a<lb/>further diminution of the marvellous cataract. The<lb/>progress of
                    population, at present, is obstructed, not<lb/>only by the wet, unhealthy state
                    of the country, but<lb/><pb n="120" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_120"/>also by other
                    circumstances: viz. one-seventh of the<lb/>whole country is reserved for the
                    crown, and one-<lb/>seventh for the episcopal clergy: also by an
                    existing<lb/>law of old Canada, all real estates, though sold seven<lb/> times
                    in seven years, must be sold at the chapel door,<lb/> mostly on first day
                    afternoon, one-ninth whereof<lb/>goes to the Roman church. By this means,
                    some<lb/>congregations, especially in Montreal and Quebec,<lb/>have become
                    immensely rich, and enabled to carry<lb/>on their idolatrous pomp and parade of
                    worship, so<lb/>as to make the world wonder. But as light is rising,<lb/>a
                    necessary reform is apprehended to be not far dis-<lb/>tant.</p></div>

                <p>
                    Had a solid interview with <persName
                        key="celli1">Elliott</persName>, deputy<lb/>agent of Indian affairs for the
                    British. He is pre-<lb/>paring to return to the Indian council at the <geogName
                        key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>.<lb/> We proposed to him, whether there would
                    be any<lb/>impropriety in our going with him. To which he<lb/>replied, as his
                    sentiment, that where the Indians<lb/>were now assembled, was their own council
                    ground,<lb/>and on a path that was not to be trod in, but by war-<lb/>riors: and
                    therefore, it was his opinion, it would not<lb/>be eligible to move that way at
                    present. We let<lb/>him know our prospects were, that every assistance<lb/>from
                    the British government, towards negociating a<lb/>peace with the Indians, would
                    be afforded. He gave<lb/>us to understand, the Indians were generally
                    acquaint-<lb/>ed with our being here, and our views towards them,<lb/>and hoped,
                    on the return of the Indian embassy,<lb/>some way would open for our relief.
                    Finding no<lb/>way to have an opportunity with them collectively,<lb/>we
                    concluded to write again to the agent, <persName key="amcke1"
                    >McKee</persName>,<lb/> and also to the Indians; which <persName key="celli1"
                        >Elliott</persName> assured us<lb/>should be fully and fairly interpreted to
                    them. With<lb/><pb n="121" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_121"/>this we were for the
                    present obliged to rest satisfied,<lb/>in our probationary tribulated allotment.
                    I can truly<lb/>say, I travailed with many pangs to be delivered,<lb/>with
                    breathings to Him who alone can help and in-<lb/>terpose, when all human aid is
                    utterly unavailing.</p>
                <p> It is wheat harvest; the grain is well filled; but in<lb/>many places, it is
                    much injured by a kind of smut,<lb/>or blast. The grain is as large as good
                    wheat, but<lb/> appears of a dusky color; and being bruised, or cut<lb/>in two,
                    the contents are like soot, black and dusty.<lb/>Sometimes ten blasted ears for
                    one sound one. In<lb/> divers instances, wheat fields are rendered
                    entirely<lb/>useless. When one-half, or one-third, or even one-<lb/>tenth, is
                    smutted wheat, it spoils the whole. The<lb/>farmer is obliged to wash all his
                    wheat, through<lb/>three or four waters, before it is fit for bread.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-17">17th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>No admission being apparent into the
                    In-<lb/>dian country, as the best expedient, we concluded<lb/>to send by
                        <persName key="celli1">Capt. Elliott</persName>, Friends' Address,
                    accompa-<lb/>nied by a short epistle of our own, to the Indians:<lb/>also, a
                    letter to <persName key="amcke1">Col. McKee</persName>. We remain daily
                    ex-<lb/>ercised in a patient, fervent travail, that the Supreme<lb/>Controller
                    of events, may bring to pass his hidden<lb/>purposes, according to his own
                    sacred determination,<lb/>to the exaltation of his own great name, in
                    these<lb/>dark regions of violence, murder, and licentiousness<lb/>of almost
                    every kind. The awful language of the<lb/>Most High to a backsliding people
                    formerly, has<lb/>frequently impressed my mind, as applicable to
                    the<lb/>inhabitants of these countries, with some few ex-<lb/>ceptions, “My soul
                    loathed them, and their souls<lb/>abhorred me.”</p>
                <p>This day a cannon was fired, for the direction of a<lb/>man supposed to be lost
                    in the woods. It frequent-<lb/><pb n="122" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_122"/>ly
                    happens, that people get bewildered in this coun-<lb/>try, and sometimes lost,
                    especially in cloudy wea-<lb/>ther. If they go but one mile in the woods, such
                    is<lb/>the sameness of soil, timber, &amp;c. with no mountains,<lb/>and few
                    streams to guide them, they frequently take<lb/>the opposite direction from the
                    settlement, and get<lb/>into difficulty.</p>
                <p>We have lately heard of the arrival of a number<lb/>of <orgName
                        key="creek">Creek</orgName> and <orgName
                        key="cherokee">cherokee Indians</orgName>, in the
                    neighbour-<lb/>hood of the Indian council; we fear, with views not<lb/>friendly
                    to a peaceable accommodation of matters<lb/>with the western Indians. We have
                    heard, hostili-<lb/>ties between them and the whites, have been renew-<lb/>ed to
                    the southward. Great is the opposition, at<lb/>present, in the earth, to the
                    peaceable kingdom of<lb/> Christ, our Redeemer. Under a sense of which,
                    my<lb/>spirit bows with intercession, that Israel may abide<lb/>in their tents,
                    where they will be covered, as under<lb/>the hollow of his divine hand, until
                    his indignation<lb/>pass over.</p></div>

                <p>
                    I had an interview with <persName
                        key="cwell2">Capt. George Wel-<lb/>bank</persName>, who appeared an
                    intelligent, cool, dispassion-<lb/>ate man. He came with a detachment of
                        <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokee</orgName><lb/>and
                    <orgName key="creek">Creek Indians</orgName>, from
                    their towns in the southern<lb/>territory, he says, more than a thousand miles
                    from<lb/> hence in a straight line; and that they were ninety<lb/>days on their
                    journey. His principal business ap-<lb/>peared to be with <persName key="cengl1"
                        >Col. England</persName>, who immediately<lb/>gave orders for the sloop
                    Felicity to sail, with <persName key="cwell2">Capt.<lb/>Welbank</persName> on
                    board, to <placeName key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>, on the way to <persName
                        key="gsim">Gov.<lb/> Simcoe</persName>. Large rolls of intelligence were
                    despatched<lb/>by him, containing, as we supposed, matters of im-<lb/>portance.
                    Shortly before, <persName key="cengl1">Col. England</persName> assured
                    our<lb/>friends, the Felicity was detained in the harbor on <lb/><pb n="123"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_123"/> purpose to transport us to <placeName
                        key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>, or <placeName key="ferie">Fort
                        Erie</placeName>,<lb/>as was most eligible on the shortest notice.</p>
                <p>In conversation with <persName key="cwell2">Capt. Welbank</persName>, on the
                    situ-<lb/>ation of Indian affairs to the southward, with which<lb/>he discovered
                    extensive knowledge, he asserted as<lb/>follows: — That in the year <date
                        when="1791">1791</date>, a treaty was held<lb/>with the southern Indians,
                    negociated on behalf of<lb/>the United States, by a person who made out
                    the<lb/>articles of the treaty in writing, wherein he inserted<lb/>the free
                    navigation of the <geogName key="tenne">Cherokee river</geogName>,
                    without<lb/>their knowledge, and bribed the interpreter to read,<lb/>ten miles
                    round <placeName key="nashv">Nashville</placeName> village, where forty was<lb/>
                    inserted. There was a large extent of country, for<lb/>which the natives
                    required three thousand dollars<lb/>per annum, but he assured them his power
                    would<lb/>not permit him to go so high; but for the present,<lb/>he would insure
                    two thousand dollars, and had no<lb/>doubt of obtaining the whole sum, by an
                    application<lb/>to Congress. But in the article it was read, two<lb/>thousand
                    dollars, where one thousand only was en-<lb/>tered. And after all, the survey
                    far exceeded the<lb/>limits of the land agreed on. Of which grievances,<lb/>the
                    bloody fellow, <persName key="notaw1">Notawasky</persName>, <persName
                        key="jober1">Joberson</persName>, and Prince<lb/>of Eastern Airy, came to
                    Congress for redress; they<lb/>were politely received, and assured justice
                    should<lb/> take place. On the faith of which, they returned,<lb/>and made
                    report to their people, who rested satisfied,<lb/>until their hopes of redress
                    were laid waste, by Spen-<lb/>cer and others
                    coming over the dividing ridge, be-<lb/>tween <geogName key="holst"
                        >Holstein</geogName> and <geogName key="tenne">Tennessee rivers</geogName>,
                    (which was the<lb/>boundary prescribed) building mills, and piqueting<lb/>forts,
                    on the waters of the <geogName key="tenne">Tennessee</geogName>. <persName
                        key="cwell2">Capt. Wel-<lb/>bank</persName> says, the Indians have applied
                    to the Spaniards,<lb/>and received assurances they shall be supplied with
                        <lb/><pb n="124" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_124"/> necessaries. There were some
                    reasons for believing<lb/><persName key="cwell2">Capt. Welbank</persName> was
                    now here, to negociate a friend-<lb/>ship with the British.</p>
                <p>This afternoon, <persName key="jelli1">John Elliott</persName> and myself,
                    walked<lb/>three or four miles, to see sixteen <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneida Indians</orgName>,<lb/> amongst whom are
                    several principal men, <persName key="gduck1">George<lb/>Duckwell</persName>,
                        <persName key="ab">Abram</persName>, &amp;c. We had some conversation<lb/>
                    with them on the advantages of peace, and the bless-<lb/>ings consequent on
                    being redeemed out of the spirit<lb/>of war. We also entered a little into the
                    subjects<lb/> of the existing uneasiness between the Indians and<lb/>our
                    government. <persName key="gduck1">Duckwell</persName>, an old man, said,
                    the<lb/>dispute was about lands west of the <geogName key="ohior"
                        >Ohio</geogName> — that he<lb/>was at a treaty, held at <placeName
                        key="fstan">Fort Stanwix</placeName>, twenty-four<lb/>years ago, which was a
                    general treaty with all the<lb/>tribes; and then, the <geogName key="ohior"
                        >Ohio</geogName> was agreed to be the<lb/>boundary. Since which time, he
                    knew of no treaty,<lb/>where the chiefs who had a right to sell lands,
                    were<lb/>collected. I find the Six Nations claim a kind of<lb/>sovereignty over
                    the soil, to a great extent south-<lb/>ward. <persName key="ab">Abram</persName>
                    said, he married his wife amongst the<lb/><orgName
                        key="wyandot">Wyandots</orgName>, and some years ago, they made a
                    visit<lb/>to see her relations, "and I say, brothers, what you<lb/>always go to
                    war — fight 'mericas? They say — if<lb/>'mericas love peace, give us our lands —
                    stay that<lb/> side 'hio — shake hands — call brothers; — but if ‘me-<lb/>ricas
                    come take our country, where deer plenty,<lb/>turkeys, wild cows — good land —
                    then war — always<lb/> war." We told him, we never went to war, nor<lb/>our
                    friends, for one hundred and fifty years past —<lb/>that all men, of all
                    nations, white, red, and black,<lb/>were our brothers — that one Great Spirit
                    made us<lb/>all, and was father of us all. They said, Ouch, that<lb/>is good,
                    very good.</p></div>

                <p>Staid mostly at our lodgings, writing,
                    and<lb/>conversing with some intelligent travellers. One<lb/>of them related a

                    — but added, that younger Indians,<lb/>who had travelled further north-west, had
                    seen some<lb/>things still more wonderful. <persName key="frobi1"
                        >Frobisher</persName> asked him,<lb/>if he did not think some parts of their
                    relation un-<lb/>true? The old Indian replied, no; it is not possible<lb/>it can
                    be lies, for they had never seen a white man<lb/>in their lives! A severe
                    reflection on Christians, so<lb/>called.</p></div>

                <p>A woman was interred at the Roman
                    cha-<lb/>pel, with the usual pomp, parade, and superstition.<lb/>Candles burning
                    in clear sunshine — host and holy<lb/>water displayed — black pall surplices.
                    All the males<lb/> bare-headed, walking slowly — the sexton going be-<lb/>fore,
                    the host-bearer next, with a boy on each side,<lb/>carrying lighted candles.
                    Then the priest, in his<lb/> pontifical robes, with a boy before him, with a
                    brass<lb/>laver or font, containing the consecrated water, with<lb/>a brush in
                    it. On each side of the priest were sing-<lb/>ers, dolefully humming Latin. The
                    priest held a<lb/>book in his hand, which he sometimes opened, and<lb/>then sung
                    Latin — several times sprinkling the bier<lb/>and pall with the water. The
                    singers and boys bear-<lb/>ing the candlesticks and laver, as also those
                    who<lb/>supported the bier, were clothed outside with black.<lb/>The bells rung
                    frequently. Indeed, the whole pro-<lb/><pb n="126" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_126"/>
                    cession appeared solemnly dark. When they came<lb/>to the grave, which was about
                    two and a half feet<lb/>deep, in which was much water, the priest took
                    the<lb/>brush, and added a little more — they laid down the<lb/>coffin, and for
                    a time dolefully hummed more Latin.<lb/>During which, the people generally went
                    on their<lb/>knees. When that was over, the people departed,<lb/>leaving the
                    sexton to fill up the grave alone. I am<lb/>told the water rises so near the
                    surface of the ground<lb/>in these countries, that it is difficult to bury a
                    corpse<lb/>so deep, but what the wolves can scratch down to<lb/> it. As they
                    often bury without coffins, many who<lb/>are killed in battle in the woods, and
                    others murder-<lb/>ed in cold blood and left above ground, the wolves<lb/>have
                    devoured them. It is said, these animals have<lb/>become so fierce and fond of
                    human flesh, that they<lb/>have attacked, and destroyed people in the
                    woods.<lb/>The Indians used to call them brothers, and would<lb/>not kill them;
                    but one or two of their people having<lb/>been killed by those creatures, the
                    Indians have<lb/>now proclaimed war against them, killing all they<lb/>can.</p>
                <p> This low, level country, abounds with sugar-trees<lb/>to such a degree, that if
                    the manufactory of sugar<lb/>was promoted extensively in this place, it might
                    be<lb/>ranked among the exports of North America. The<lb/>Indians, who have
                    kettles suitable for the business,<lb/>make large quantities in the spring of
                    the year, and<lb/>sell it as low as six-pence per pound, and under.<lb/>Some
                    have been so fraudulent, as to mix sand with<lb/>it, and when detected,
                    endeavoured to justify them-<lb/>selves, by the example of the white people
                    mixing<lb/>water with the rum, sold to them. A practice, very<lb/>common amongst
                    the rum sellers, who say, rum<lb/><pb n="127" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_127"/> hurts
                    them, and the less they get the better for them.<lb/>It is, therefore, evident,
                    that in proportion to their<lb/>intercourse with the whites, they have increased
                    in<lb/>treachery, fraud, drunkenness, and licentiousness of<lb/>every kind; and
                    appear, at present, not unlikely to<lb/>be a rod prepared for our close
                    chastisement.</p>
                <p>Being in their nature, or by habit, unfeeling and<lb/>ferocious, I have often in
                    this journey, had my feel-<lb/>ings wounded, by seeing old gray-headed
                    women,<lb/>carrying heavy burdens of skins, venison, brooms,<lb/>matchcoats,
                    &amp;c. with large drops of sweat rolling<lb/>from their aged brows; when
                    several sprightly young<lb/> and middle-aged men, went lightly on before
                    them,<lb/>with nothing to carry but their clothes, tomahawk,<lb/>and scalping
                    knife, dangling by their thigh.</p></div>

                <p>Last evening, I had an account from a
                    man<lb/> who came from the Glades up the <geogName key="miamr"
                        >Miami-of-the-lake</geogName>,<lb/>that the <orgName
                            key="creek">Creek</orgName> and <orgName
                        key="cherokee">Cherokee Indians</orgName> passed through<lb/>the
                        <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName> towns
                    there, and produced a piece of<lb/>tobacco died red, which was received as the
                    decla-<lb/>ration of war against the United States — that the<lb/>white
                    prisoners were very numerous amongst the<lb/>Indians — and that, at the Rapids,
                    as he came along,<lb/> he saw a beautiful woman, well dressed, just
                    brought<lb/>in.</p>
                <p>This morning, a number of <orgName key="oneida">Oneida
                        Indians</orgName> came<lb/>to our lodgings, and informed, that two of
                    their<lb/> number had just come from the Rapids, and brought<lb/>tidings, that
                    it was reported there, that Wayne's<lb/>army was advancing, and large numbers of
                    the In-<lb/>dians had left the Council, to go to defend their<lb/>towns. They
                    sent to the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> to
                    repair to their<lb/>assistance, which they were resolved not to comply<lb/>with.
                    Which determination, we endeavored to<lb/><pb n="128" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_128"
                    /> strengthen, and gave it as our opinion, that the army<lb/>was not advancing,
                    and would not advance, until<lb/>the result of the treaty was known. They
                    were<lb/>very jealous of some deception, which it was hard<lb/>to remove.</p>
                <p> This forenoon, had a solid meeting in the ship-<lb/>yard; after which, a number
                    of the gentlemen of the<lb/>town came to see us. In a little time, one
                    came,<lb/>who announced the Dunmore was at the mouth of<lb/>the river, with the
                    commissioners on board. Soon<lb/> after, <persName key="cgibs">Capt.
                        Gibbons</persName>, who was a passenger, came<lb/>and confirmed the news. We
                    had appointed a meet-<lb/>ing at five o'clock, and thought best to
                    endeavour<lb/>for stillness at present. The afternoon meeting was<lb/>not so
                    large as the former. It was a season of heavy<lb/>exercise, through the
                    prevalence of a carnal, luke-<lb/>warm disposition, in many; yet the great
                    Shepherd<lb/>was mercifully pleased to baptize a remnant into<lb/>tenderness of
                    spirit; and the opportunity concluded<lb/>with solemn supplication.</p>
                <p> In the evening, we had a visit from <persName key="cgibs">____
                        Gibbons</persName>,<lb/>an officer in the regiment of Queen's Rangers.
                    He<lb/>was present when the Indians opened their embassy<lb/>to the
                    commissioners, at <placeName key="nav">Navy Hall</placeName>. About
                    ninety<lb/>Indians were there. When the governor, <persName key="gsim"
                        >Simcoe</persName>,<lb/>was present, <persName key="cbran1">Capt.
                        Brant</persName> spoke as follows: “Gen-<lb/>tlemen, you say you are
                    commissioners from the<lb/>United States; have you power to alter the
                    disputed<lb/>line between you and us?" They answered, "We<lb/>have." "Can you
                    tell us the reason of an armed<lb/>force advancing at this time into our
                    country?" The<lb/>answer was, "We cannot, neither do we believe it;<lb/>yet to
                    make all parties satisfied, we will despatch an<lb/>express immediately to the
                    war office, to stop every<lb/><pb n="129" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_129"/>motion of
                    an advance.” Then they said, "Come<lb/>on, we will treat with you.” <persName
                        key="jparr2">Jasper Parrish</persName> was<lb/>despatched to <placeName

                <p>The commissioners not being permitted to come<lb/>here, were landed at the mouth
                    of the river, and<lb/>have sent for us.</p></div>

                <p>I visited <persName key="cengl1">Col.

                        Parrish</persName>, to confer with him, on the most eligi-<lb/>ble mode of

                    his<lb/>wonted politeness, offered his barge; but gave it as<lb/>his sentiment,
                    that we had better stay till fifth-day,<lb/>when the Dunmore would sail, to be
                    at the commis-<lb/>sioners' direction. As it was his orders, it was also<lb/>his
                    inclination, to accommodate them, all in his<lb/>power, we consented to add two
                    days more to our<lb/> confinement.</p>
                <p> We had an interview with several Indians to-day;<lb/>one of them acknowledged he
                    had killed a Kuhemo-<lb/>comon, and stole three horses this spring. He was<lb/>a
                    warlike creature, and we could do little with him,<lb/>for want of an
                    interpreter. I gave him a few hints,<lb/>a pipe, and a loaf of bread, and he
                    departed.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-24">24th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>A solemn morning; my mind composed,<lb/>and
                    engaged in mental aspirations to the Supreme<lb/>Controller of events, that he
                    might be pleased to<lb/>bless our endeavours to promote the glory and
                    ho-<lb/>nour of his own great name, the advantage of our<lb/>country, the peace
                    of nations, and of individuals. —<lb/>In which I beheld, that so long as we
                    dwelt only on<lb/>the surface, and superficies of important subjects, in<lb/>a
                    chain of carnal reasoning, and in the fogs and mists<lb/><pb n="130"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_130"/>of earthly wisdom and human policy, we are in
                    dan-<lb/>ger of making errors in judgment, and of viewing<lb/>the agents of
                    distress, as the primary cause of evil.<lb/>But by tracing effects to their
                    causes, and weighing<lb/> actions in the equal and unalterable scales of
                    justice<lb/>and truth, I believe we shall centre in prospect with<lb/>the
                    inspired penman, “Affliction cometh not forth<lb/> of the dust, neither doth
                    trouble spring out of the<lb/>ground." Is there not a cause? Consider,
                    yea,<lb/>awfully contemplate the announced decree of Him<lb/>"who weigheth the
                    mountains in scales, and the<lb/>hills in a balance, and meteth out the heavens
                    with<lb/>a span, and measureth the water of the seas in the<lb/>hollow of his
                    hand; and before whom, all nations<lb/>are but as the drop of a bucket," — "Such
                    measure<lb/>as ye mete, to you it shall be measured again."</p>
                <p> When I view the dreadful scenes of barbarity, at-<lb/>tendant on the African
                    slave trade, and its train of<lb/>concurrent circumstances, my soul is almost
                    over-<lb/>whelmed with discouragement. Judgment is the<lb/>Lord's, and he surely
                    will repay. Have the Indians<lb/>burned houses; murdered men, women, and
                    chil-<lb/>dren; betrayed their friends; carried away into cap-<lb/>tivity and
                    bondage, old and young, male and female;<lb/>and cruelly burned and tortured
                    others; lurked pri-<lb/>vily for prey; shot down men at their ploughs,
                    and<lb/>travellers on the road? Yea, they have; until the<lb/> rehearsal of many
                    of their horrid scenes of barbar-<lb/>ity, has agitated, shocked, and almost
                    convulsed<lb/>every nerve.</p>
                <p> But what shall I say? How are my feeling<lb/>wounded, on being constrained to
                    contrast these<lb/>reproaches to humanity, with the conduct of civi-<lb/>lized,
                    professing Christian nations? In which I la-<lb/><pb n="131"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_131"/>ment, our own government (in most respects,
                    super-<lb/>latively excellent) is obliged to take a share. Ves-<lb/>sels fitted
                    out, commanded by men, with hearts cal-<lb/>lous to the feelings of humanity,
                    and deaf to her<lb/>cries — which repair to the African coast, stir up<lb/>war,
                    burn towns, kill, catch, and carry captive, in-<lb/>discriminately, these poor,
                    and, as to them, altoge-<lb/>ther unoffending people — bring them to distant
                    and<lb/> different cities and towns, ringing with alarms for<lb/>worship,
                    sounding with hymns and psalms from<lb/>stately temples, where they offer their
                    devotion to<lb/>the universal Parent, who hath revealed his will in<lb/>the
                    language of "do justly, love mercy, and walk<lb/>humbly with thy God" —
                    professing to believe in<lb/>the Divine Lawgiver, whose statute is,
                    "Whatso-<lb/>ever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye<lb/>even so unto
                    them." Instead whereof, they are sold<lb/>like beasts, at market; separated,
                    husband from wife,<lb/>children from parents; without regard to the
                    tender-<lb/>est ties of natural affection: often put under unfeel-<lb/>ing
                    whippers, and cruel taskmasters, where they are<lb/>frequently starved, or whipt
                    to death — and if they<lb/>run away, and are caught, they have been hung
                    up<lb/>without trial or jury. Some who had procured their<lb/>liberty, have been
                    hunted with horses and dogs, and<lb/> shot down. While such enormities are in
                    the land,<lb/>and winked at by the rulers, shall we not lay our<lb/>mouths in
                    the dust, with this language impressed on<lb/>our minds, "O Lord! just, and
                    true, and righteous,<lb/>are thy judgments." I cannot omit remarking the<lb/>joy
                    we feel, at the escape of a captive white, from<lb/>among the Indians; yet, what
                    a stir when a negro<lb/>slave attempts his liberty! advertisements printed,<lb/>
                    and rewards offered to take him, alive or dead.</p>

                <p> This afternoon, had a visit from <persName key="fbaub1">Fransey
                        Baubee</persName>,<lb/>just returned from the assembly of Upper

                        key="gsim">Gov. Simcoe</persName> appeared an advocate on the side of<lb/>
                    liberty. But so strong was the opposition from mo-<lb/>tives of interest, they
                    could carry the subject no fur-<lb/>ther, than liberty at twenty-five years of
                    age, to all<lb/>born after this date. Which account increased my<lb/>exercise
                    for the lamentable state of mankind. Blood<lb/>touching blood, mingled with
                    tears of the oppressed,<lb/>whose groans ascend to the ears of the Lord of

                    ease, and pride, spending days and nights<lb/>in revelling, feasting, fiddling,
                    dancing, drunkenness,<lb/>debauchery, and abominable conversation. On

                    accompanying us. Many of the officers of the gar-<lb/>rison, and inhabitants of
                    the place, came to the wharf,<lb/>to take leave of us. Among the latter, is a
                    very re-<lb/>spectable family, of the name of Reynolds. They<lb/>have an amiable
                    daughter, <persName key="mreyn1">Margaret</persName>. We proceeded<lb/>down the

                    weeks absence: the<lb/>joy was mutual. <persName key="cbunb1">Capt.

                <p>First-day. Walked three miles, and were<lb/>
                    paddled about three miles more in a canoe, by two<lb/>Indians, to a meeting we
                    had appointed on the<lb/>Island of <placeName key="gisle">Grosseel</placeName>,
                    where fifty or sixty people col-<lb/>lected, who behaved with solid gravity. We
                    were<lb/>favoured to feel an evidence of the simplicity, purity,<lb/>and
                    spirituality of the gospel dispensation, which I<lb/>hope was preached to them
                    in the pure disinterested<lb/>love thereof. We returned with peaceful minds
                    and<lb/>thankful hearts. After meeting, a woman said, she<lb/>blushed to tell
                    me, that the preceding evening, she<lb/>joined with others, in condemning us as
                    wolves in<lb/> sheep's clothing; but she was now fully convinced,<lb/>that what
                    she had been seeking abroad amongst forms<lb/>and shadows, was to be found at
                    home in her own<lb/>heart; and hoped to retain a thankful remembrance<lb/>of the
                    mercy vouchsafed to her that day: adding,<lb/>she did not lament her troubles
                    and exercises, which<lb/>were great, seeing they had, at length, brought
                    her<lb/>to the discovery of the way of life. Many others,<lb/><pb n="134"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_134"/> I believe, were reached this day. Yet my joy
                    was<lb/>not of long continuance; for about eight o'clock in<lb/>the evening,
                    some of our jolly fellow-travellers, pro-<lb/>moted an Indian dance, in which
                    they joined. The<lb/>Indians were about twenty in number, with several<lb/>white
                    men in the ring, and a candle in the centre.<lb/>Round and round they danced,
                    with ungrateful grunt-<lb/>ing, barking, and at intervals, screaming and
                    hollow-<lb/>ing — the war dance, the peace dance, the scalping<lb/>dance,
                    &amp;c. which they continued till near midnight,<lb/>frequently regaling
                    themselves with spirits. This<lb/>conduct, considering the solemn importance of
                    our<lb/>business, proved very exercising to my mind, and<lb/>almost overwhelmed
                    me with discouragement.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-07-29">29th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>I felt heavy, and sorrowful, on
                    account<lb/>of the last evening's conduct, which I suggested to<lb/>some of our
                    leading gentlemen. I also testified my<lb/>disapprobation of such conduct, to
                    the Indians; in<lb/>which I was joined by a squaw, whose husband, by<lb/>way of
                    apology, told me, white men promoted it,<lb/>and joined them in it. This I was
                    constrained to<lb/>admit, however degrading. So that upon the
                    whole,<lb/>contrasting Indians and whites, of all nations, upon<lb/>the broad
                    scale, our superiority appears but imag0-<lb/>nary, and does not exist.</p>
                <p>About five o'clock this afternoon, arrived <persName key="celli1">Capt.<lb/>
                        Elliott</persName>, <persName key="tmcke1">Capt. McKee</persName>, <persName

                    other Indians from <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>. The<lb/>Indians
                    encamped opposite to us, on Bay’s Long<lb/>Island. The white men came over to
                    us, and in-<lb/>formed, that the Indians were much dissatisfied, on<lb/>the
                    report of their deputation to the commissioners<lb/>at <placeName key="niaga"
                        >Niagara</placeName>; and had sent their second embassy, ex-<lb/><pb n="135"

                <p>A deputation of twenty-five Indians,
                    came<lb/>over the river about nine o'clock; when seated, the<lb/>commissioners
                    seated before them, and we forming<lb/>an angle at the Indians' right hand,
                    after a solemn<lb/>pause, an Indian inquired, "Are you ready?" <persName
                        key="sgirt1">Si-<lb/>mon Girty</persName>was told to answer, yes. Then a
                        <orgName key="wyandot">Wy-<lb/>andot</orgName> chief
                    arose, took off his hat, and thanked the<lb/>Great Spirit, they had met; and
                    spoke some time,<lb/>introductory to the delivery of a written
                    message:<lb/>wherein they state, that matters were not fully ex-<lb/>plained at
                        <placeName key="niaga">Niagara</placeName>; therefore they explicitly
                    require<lb/>an answer, whether the commissioners have power<lb/>to make
                        <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> the boundary; and if so,
                    immediately<lb/> to remove all the inhabitants off the land, west of<lb/>the
                    Ohio? To which, <persName key="glinc1">Gen. Lincoln</persName> (after all
                    three<lb/> had read it, and consulted together) answered, they<lb/>would inform
                    them to-morrow. After this, we had<lb/>a solid conference with the
                    commissioners, on the<lb/>obstacles thrown in the way, and they explained
                        the<lb/><placeName key="niaga">Niagara</placeName> conference; which we
                    approved as fair and<lb/>candid. This demand appeared a new matter,
                    pro-<lb/>bably suggested by some designing enemy to peace.<lb/>The letter was
                    signed by ten nations, viz. <orgName key="delaware"

                <p>About nine o'clock, the Indians came
                    over<lb/> the river, among whom, <persName key="ocoho1"
                    >Ocohongehelas</persName>, the <orgName key="delaware"
                        >Dela-<lb/>ware</orgName> war chief, his brother, and <persName key="ljonn1"
                        >Little Jonny</persName>, a<lb/>
                    <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName> chief, and

                        key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName><lb/>chief, were principal men. We
                    spoke to them, and<lb/>told them we were their brothers, the Quakers,
                        come<lb/><pb n="136" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_136"/> from <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, to see them. They showed joy<lb/>in their
                    countenances, and shook hands very affec-<lb/>tionately. They told us their
                    chiefs, who knew us,<lb/>were almost all dead. We answered them, our
                    fa-<lb/>thers who were acquainted with our Indian brothers,<lb/>were likewise
                    mostly fallen asleep; but notwith-<lb/>standing, we their children, possessed
                    the same love<lb/>and friendship for the Indians, as our fathers did;<lb/>and
                    wished it to continue to the end of time. They<lb/>were very solid, and their
                    countenances marked<lb/>with the weight and importance of the business.
                    We<lb/>smoked with them; but perceiving their minds un-<lb/>der such pressure
                    and exercise, we did not talk much.<lb/>They told us, through <persName
                        key="sgirt1">Girty</persName>, that they could not<lb/>now say much; but
                    would, after they got their an-<lb/>swer. They staid about two hours, and
                    received no-<lb/>tice from the commissioners, that about five o'clock<lb/>in the
                    afternoon, they should have an answer to the<lb/>embassy. Then they returned to
                    the island.</p>
                <p>This forenoon, four British officers came down<lb/>from the garrison; <persName

                    dined with us, and waited the return of the<lb/>Indian deputation. About five
                    o'clock, the Indians<lb/>came. About six, the commissioners came out. —<lb/>
                    <persName key="cpic">Col. Pickering</persName> politely addressed them; then
                    read,<lb/>and <persName key="tjone1">Thomas Jones</persName> interpreted it into
                    Seneca, in<lb/>substance — beginning at the treaty of <placeName key="fstan"
                        >Fort Stanwix</placeName>,<lb/>twenty-five years ago, and recited the terms,
                        that<lb/><geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> was then, concluded to be the
                    boundary.—<lb/>Then recited subsequent treaties, beginning at <placeName
                        key="fstan">Fort<lb/>Stanwix</placeName>, about nine years ago, and one held
                    ninety<lb/>days after, at one place, another, at another, until<lb/><pb n="137"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_137"/> he mentioned four different places, and the
                    proceed-<lb/>ings of each. That in consequence of these treaties,<lb/>the United
                    States had sold large tracts of land, which<lb/>were now settled, and largely
                    improved, on the north<lb/>west side of the <geogName key="ohior"
                        >Ohio</geogName>. Therefore, impossible now<lb/>to make it the boundary: and
                    that, in order to come<lb/>to a peace, and to understand each other
                    perfectly,<lb/> by writing, was not the way. Which new mode<lb/>they had
                    adopted, contrary to all former precedents.<lb/>But he explicitly declared, the
                    United States wished<lb/>for peace, on the most just and unequivocal terms.<lb/>
                    Which, as the Indians demanded, and no better way<lb/>opened, were inserted —
                    viz. That what the United<lb/>States wished for, was, to have all the lands
                    ceded<lb/>by the treaty at <placeName key="fharm">Fort Harmer</placeName>,
                    confirmed; and a<lb/>small piece at the <geogName key="ohiof">Falls of
                        Ohio</geogName>, for <persName key="gclar1">Gen. Clarke</persName><lb/> and
                    his warriors. And, if all that land could not<lb/>be given up, they were
                    commissioned to draw a<lb/>new boundary, as might be agreed upon in
                    general<lb/>council, if that could be obtained; for which, they<lb/>would
                    advance more money than ever had been ad-<lb/>vanced, at any one treaty, as a
                    purchase for Indian<lb/>lands, with much goods: in addition to which,
                    they<lb/>would engage to pay an annual subsidy in goods,<lb/>accommodated to
                    their wants, equal to what they<lb/>annually procured off the lands, by skins
                    and peltry.<lb/>And further, as formerly, some improper ideas had<lb/>been held
                    up, td their uneasiness, that in conse-<lb/>quence of the right of pre-emption,
                    given up by the<lb/>king of Great Britain, and lately confirmed by
                    Lord<lb/>Dorchester, we considered all the lands east and<lb/>south of the
                        <geogName key="missi">Mississippi</geogName> and the Lakes, the
                    proper-<lb/>ty of the United States, without regard to Indian<lb/>claims. Which
                    right, or pretension of right, we<lb/><pb n="138" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_138"/>
                    publicly disclaimed, until fair purchase was made<lb/>of the Indian owners; and
                    this right of purchase,<lb/>belonged to the United States only. That
                    these<lb/>were the leading traits of their commission. This<lb/>was read by

                    when the paper, containing the above<lb/>sentiments, was delivered to the old

                    to-morrow<lb/>afternoon. They then departed to their camp, and<lb/>we to our
                    tents. It was a cool night; but the exer-<lb/>cise of my mind, arising from the
                    importance of<lb/>the business, was such, that I could hardly forbear<lb/>
                    trembling. The countenances of the Indians, were<lb/> so sedate, solid, and
                    determined, that notwithstand-<lb/>ing the propositions held out, appeared to be
                    liberal,<lb/> and well adapted to the happiness of the Indians,<lb/> yet, such
                    was their jealousy, and want of faith in<lb/> our government, that I was afraid
                    they would not<lb/> take. Which apprehensions, with the screams and<lb/> hollows
                    of an Indian dance, near our tents, inter-<lb/>rupted my repose for hours.</p></div>

                <p>I awoke about day-break; soon<lb/>
                    after, I heard ten reports of a rifle, one after ano-<lb/>ther, in the Indian
                    camp; which was one for each<lb/> nation that had signed the written Indian
                    embassy,<lb/> from the council at the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>.
                    About eight o’clock,<lb/> fifteen of them came over, and informed, they
                    were<lb/>prepared to speak to the commissioners; who soon<lb/>seated themselves:
                    when the old king who spoke be-<lb/>fore, said, <said who="carry1">Brothers, we want to be at
                    peace with<lb/>you; but you tell us you have had treaties there,<lb/>and there,
                    and there, and purchased lands on this<lb/><pb n="139" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_139"

                    twenty-five years ago,<lb/>till now. We are the owners of these lands,
                    and<lb/>we never sold the lands, and they are ours on this<lb/>side <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, and yours on the other side <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>. You<lb/>may go home and tell <persName

                    said to us, very well. We<lb/>expect you understand us.</said> They had <persName
                        key="sgirt1">Simon Girty</persName><lb/>for an interpreter. They then arose,
                    and stepped<lb/>off a few perches, and spoke together, when one<lb/>found he had
                    made a mistake, in saying we might<lb/>go home, and desired the commissioners to
                    wait, till<lb/>they could go to the council, and return with an<lb/>answer;
                    which they supposed might be accomplish-<lb/>ed in five days. We felt some
                    willingness to accom-<lb/>pany them, but the Indians not requesting it,
                    and<lb/>others not appearing desirous for it, particularly<lb/><persName

                        >McKee</persName>,* who were going along,<lb/>we had to resign it. However,
                    we forwarded our<lb/>Address, and a short epistle to the Indians, which<lb/>we
                    had intended to send from <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName> by
                        <persName key="celli1">Capt. El-<lb/>liott</persName>, some weeks ago; but
                    the commissioners arri-<lb/>ving before he set out, he showed our letters
                    to<lb/>them, and they thought proper to detain them, pre-<lb/>suming we would
                    have an opportunity with them<lb/>at the general Council, ourselves. After
                    opening<lb/>and reading them, they encouraged us to send them,<lb/> though at a
                    late stage of the business. About ten<lb/>o'clock, the Indians embarked in a

                <p>The Detroit sloop left this place, loaded
                    with<lb/> skins and peltry, for <placeName key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>. I
                    spent some part<lb/>of this day, on the margin of the river, and bay.<lb/>Here
                    once stood the town and garrison of <placeName key="detro"
                    >Detroit</placeName>.<lb/> Multitudes of graves, and many foundations of
                    build-<lb/>ings are yet discoverable. We are told, about seven-<lb/>ty years
                    ago, the Indians rose, and in one night mas-<lb/>sacred every person in the
                    place, except the Ro-<lb/>man priest, who was concealed by a squaw; and
                    also<lb/>burnt all the houses. After which, the garrison was<lb/>built eighteen
                    miles higher up the river, on the op-<lb/>posite side, where it now stands.
                    Since the English<lb/>have been in possession of Canada, some bold
                    at-<lb/>tempts of like nature, have been made: one by the<lb/>noted Indian,
                    Pontiac, on the present <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>;
                    which,<lb/>in all human probability, would have succeeded, but<lb/>for some
                    intelligence from a squaw, communicated<lb/>the evening preceding the intended
                    bloody enter-<lb/>prize, to the commander, who afterwards attempted<lb/> to
                    dislodge them from the suburbs. This brought<lb/>on the fray, from whence
                        <geogName key="blood">bloody bridge</geogName> took its<lb/> name, where
                    three officers and seventy soldiers are<lb/>reported to have fallen, about a
                    mile and a half above<lb/><placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>. When the
                    veteran saw himself the con-<lb/>queror, it inspired him with ambition to get
                        upon<lb/><pb n="142" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_142"/>
                    <geogName key="fight">Fighting Island</geogName>, and attack one of the king's
                    ships,<lb/> laden with stores for the garrison. As the channel<lb/> obliged her
                    to come within musket shot of the island,<lb/>where a large number of Indians
                    had placed them-<lb/>selves, and the ship lay becalmed, they poured
                    in<lb/>bullets, like hail, against her side, hoping to have<lb/>sunk her. But
                    finding, after two days experiment,<lb/> their metal too light to effect their
                    purpose, they<lb/> took to their canoes, and made to her with toma-<lb/>hawks in
                    hand. Many got on board, notwithstand-<lb/>ing the efforts of the few mariners;
                    and when all<lb/>were expecting death in a few minutes, the captain,<lb/>a
                    resolute man, gave orders aloud, "Blow up the<lb/> ship" — he having powder on
                    board; and one of the<lb/> Indians understanding English, terrified with
                    the<lb/>horrid orders, gave the alarm quickly to his com-<lb/>panions, who
                    instantly jumped off the vessel, some<lb/>into their canoes, and others into the
                    water. Thus<lb/>the vessel, and many lives, were saved.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable, that on the same day the before<lb/> mentioned attempt was made
                    on <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, by <placeName key="ponti"
                        >Pon-<lb/>tiac</placeName>; <placeName key="michi"

                    attacked, and carried by the In-<lb/>dians.</p></div>

                <p>Last night, the musquetoes exceeded any<lb/>

                    by<lb/>which it appeared, the attack was general. This<lb/>confirmed an account

                    much indifference, as if only a<lb/> caterpillar had been bruised. After dinner,
                    I retired<lb/>about thirty perches into a garden, where the loud<lb/> peals of
                    laughter, which could easily have been heard<lb/>half a mile, were truly
                    distressing. I mentioned the<lb/>solemn subject to one of the British officers,
                    who<lb/>replied, "One of my brother officers, whom I loved<lb/>dear as my life,

                <p>This morning, twelve <orgName
                        key="ojibwe">Chipawas</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>,<lb/> and <orgName
                            key="munseeind">Munseys</orgName>, called to see us, on
                    their return home,<lb/> having staid till their clothes were mostly in
                    rags,<lb/>and I believe, they were alarmed at the contagion.<lb/> They report
                    the decease of seventeen Indians,<lb/> amongst whom were three <orgName
                       key="ojibwe">Chipawa</orgName> chiefs; and
                    in-<lb/>form, that in consequence of the sickly situation,<lb/> they were about
                    to move their camp eight miles<lb/> down the river, near the side of the lake.
                    Which<lb/> is agreeable to us, as it will be so much nearer, and<lb/>not so much
                    infested with musquetoes.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-10">10th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Last evening, several of the Indians,
                    who<lb/> arrived in the morning, came to us, much disguised<lb/> with liquor,
                    and wanted more: which not being<lb/>granted, they became rather sulky, rude,
                    and inso-<lb/>lent. One of them, who called himself <persName key="cherm1">Capt.
                        Her-<lb/>maunus</persName>, laid hold of me, partly in jest, and
                    squeezed<lb/> me hard, and said, you Quaker, you my brother.<lb/> One said, his
                    heart was bad, and another said, I am<lb/>a devil, and my name is devil. Several
                    of our com-<lb/>pany, best acquainted with Indians, appeared alarm-<lb/>ed with
                    apprehensions of danger, and did not go<lb/>into their tents till near morning.
                    About eight<lb/><pb n="145" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_145"/> o’clock, one of them
                    came from the camp, who ex-<lb/>hibited a horrid spectacle — hallooing, I am a
                    man —<lb/> I am a warrior — dashing his fist against a tree, drew<lb/> out his
                    scalping knife, brandished it through the air<lb/>with uplifted hand, roaring
                    and making a terrible<lb/>appearance. At length a sober Indian came,
                    and<lb/>took him away. However, with the trouble of In-<lb/>dians, and a host of
                    musquetoes, I dont know that<lb/>I slept ten minutes during the night.</p>
                <p>We dined this day on a masquenungy, which<lb/>weighed eighteen pounds; a very
                    delicious fish. It<lb/> was speared by an Indian. <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogName> abounds with<lb/>sturgeons so plentifully, that a couple of
                    men have<lb/>taken more than a ton weight before breakfast. It<lb/>is said, they
                    originated from four of that species<lb/>having been put in, above the falls, by
                    a French<lb/> officer; before which, it is reported, none were to<lb/>be found
                    above the great <geogName key="niagf">falls</geogName>; and when first
                    dis-<lb/>covered by the Indians, they were much alarmed.</p></div>

                <p>Our commissioners had a visit from <persName
                        key="cwell2">Capt.<lb/> Welbank</persName>, on his return from <placeName
                        key="nav">Navy Hall</placeName>; he gave<lb/> them an account, as I have
                    before noted, respecting<lb/>the treaty with the southern Indians; also
                    mention-<lb/>ed some of <persName key="amcgi1">McGillivrey</persName>'s
                    duplicity in Indian affairs;<lb/>and that the Spanish governor of <placeName
                        key="pensa">Pensacola</placeName> told<lb/>him, he was sorry he had sold off
                    so much land to<lb/>the United States; and that he could not serve
                    two<lb/>masters, he must cleave to the one or the other, and<lb/>he might choose
                    which. It appeared that <persName key="amcgi1">McGil-<lb/>livrey</persName> had
                    proposed to sell to the south branch of<lb/> the <geogName key="ocone">Ocomic
                        river</geogName>; but the nation at large withstood<lb/>it, and would give
                    up no further than the north;<lb/> to which the <orgName
                        key="creek">Creeks</orgName> unitedly agreed. That divers<lb/>
                    attempts had been made to settle it, and large clear-<lb/>ings were made upon
                    it; but at present, he believed,<lb/> there was not a standing house on the
                    space of three<lb/> hundred miles in length, and from thirty to seventy<lb/> in
                    breadth, according to the windings of the river.<lb/>Which space, is the bone of
                    contention at present,<lb/> with the <orgName
                        key="creek">Creek</orgName> nation. <persName key="cwell2"
                        >Welbank</persName> also says, the<lb/> Spaniards are industriously making
                    interest with<lb/> the southern Indians, through the agency of one<lb/>
                    <persName key="olive1">Oliver</persName>, a Frenchman: which is a subject of a
                    seri-<lb/>ous nature to our government.</p>
                <p> This afternoon, the commissioners sent off two<lb/>
                    <orgName key="oneida">Oneida Indians</orgName> express
                    to <persName key="amcke1">Col. McKee</persName>; I suppose,<lb/>to let him know,
                    that the tedious process of the<lb/>business began to feel unpleasant to many of
                    the<lb/> company. One of the interpreters, <persName key="hjone1">Horatio
                        Jones</persName>,<lb/> had lately heard of the decease of his wife, since<lb/>
                    <pb n="147" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_147"/> he left home, and several of our company
                    were<lb/>sick.</p>
                <p>I spent this evening with <persName key="cwell2">Capt. Welbank</persName>,
                        and<lb/><persName key="cbunb1">Capt. Bunbury</persName>, at <persName
                        key="ccald1">Capt. Caldwell</persName>'s, where <persName key="cwell2"
                        >Capt.<lb/>Welbank</persName> talked freely respecting the southern
                    In-<lb/>dians, and their confederates; among whom was the<lb/>governor of
                        <placeName key="pensa">Pensacola</placeName>, and the Indian nations
                    quite<lb/>to the <geogName key="missi">Mississippi</geogName>, and the mountain
                    Leader also,<lb/>who was considered fully attached to the interest of<lb/>the
                    United States. All which intelligence, with<lb/>the present tardy process of our
                    commission, im-<lb/>pressed my mind with ideas of horror and
                    distress,<lb/>approaching our extensive frontier, with some<lb/>doubts, that the
                    speculation in western estates, will<lb/> be disastrous to public tranquility
                    and peace.</p></div>

                    disor-<lb/>dered, occasioned, I supposed, by getting wet in our<lb/>tent by
                    rain, just as we lay down. <persName key="wsave1">William

                <p>My mind much tossed — looking towards<lb/>
                    home — then to the Yearly Meeting. I took a walk<lb/>down the river, where I
                    erected a seat under the<lb/>spreading boughs of a buttonwood, of whose
                    branch-<lb/>es and broad leaves I made a carpet, and sat myself<lb/>down in the
                    native splendor of one of the aboriginal<lb/><pb n="148"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_148"/> lords of the land. I contemplated the tranquil
                    abode<lb/>of our first parents in the garden, and felt happy for<lb/>a moment,
                    which was succeeded by the reflection<lb/>on Jonah's gourd, which it most
                    resembled. I felt<lb/>a necessity to breathe for the approach of that
                    peace-<lb/>ful and blessed day, when every man shall sit under<lb/>his own vine,
                    and fig-tree, and none shall make him<lb/> afraid.</p>
                <p>This afternoon, two young <orgName key="wyandot"
                        >Wyandots</orgName> arrived.<lb/>They looked wild and afraid. One of them
                    was<lb/> introduced to <persName key="glinc1">Gen. Lincoln</persName>, and
                    handed him a mes-<lb/>sage in writing, importing that the several
                    treaties<lb/>held at <placeName key="fmint">Fort McIntosh</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="fmiam">Miami</placeName>, <placeName key="muski"
                        >Muskingum</placeName>, &amp;c.<lb/> where lands had been ceded by two or
                    three nations<lb/> only, were not valid; as they had no right to dispose<lb/> of
                    lands. And as for the large sums of money pro-<lb/>posed to be paid down for the
                    country, they did not <lb/>want it; and a great many of them did not know
                    the<lb/> use of it. Therefore, desired it might be applied,<lb/> with the
                    proposed yearly salary, to the indemnifica-<lb/>tion of the settlers north of
                    the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>. And as they<lb/>supposed they were
                    mostly poor people, or else they<lb/>would not have settled on disputed lands;
                    that there-<lb/>by they might be induced to move off; and make<lb/>the <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> the boundary. For it was their land — the<lb/>
                    country to the westward was filled up — they had no<lb/>where else to repair to,
                    and they were determined<lb/>to lay their bones in it. As to the concessions,
                    the<lb/> commissioners proposed to make, by giving money,<lb/> they did not want
                    it: next, running a new line, was<lb/>but giving them a part of their own land;
                    and as to<lb/> disclaiming the right to all their country, by virtue<lb/>of the
                    peace made with the king, their father, they<lb/>knew they were never conquered,
                    and it could not<lb/><pb n="149" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_149"/> be; and as to the
                    right of pre-emption, that the Uni-<lb/>ted States, and they only, had a right
                    to purchase<lb/>Indian lands, south and east of the lakes, they de-<lb/>nied the
                    king or the United States ever having any<lb/>such right. Upon the whole, it was
                    received as a<lb/>very contemptible speech by the commissioners,
                    and<lb/>strongly marked as British manufacture. The two<lb/>Indian messengers
                    had a glass of wine each, and<lb/>victuals set. They eat but little, got up and
                    slipped<lb/>away, I believe conscious that the contents of their<lb/>message
                    would not be pleasing. This soon appear-<lb/>ed to be the case, as the baggage
                    was ordered on<lb/>board the Dunmore immediately — some for safety<lb/>proposing
                    to sleep on board.</p>
                <p>It felt exceeding gloomy to Friends. We got to-<lb/>gether to see if any thing
                    opened further for us to<lb/>do; which at present does not appear.
                    Therefore<lb/>submit the awful subject to the interposition of the<lb/>Divine
                    Hand, and turn our eyes towards our respec-<lb/>tive habitations. This evening
                    the two runners des-<lb/>patched three days ago to the Indian council,
                    return-<lb/>ed, with only a verbal message, importing that the<lb/>five nations
                    expected us to come forward, and were<lb/>moving six miles down the river, to
                    meet us. Which<lb/>appeared a cunning manœuvre of one side, or the<lb/>other. I
                    was somewhat put to a consternation, on<lb/>hearing <persName key="glinc1">Gen.
                        Lincoln</persName> express, they had received just<lb/>such an answer as he
                    could have wished. What his<lb/>meaning was, I don't know.</p></div>
            <div type="entry"><dateline><date when="1793-08-17">17th</date>. <placeName/></dateline>
                <p>Several of our company slept on board
                    the<lb/> Dunmore last night, others hurrying on board this<lb/> morning. Two
                    runners were despatched with in-<lb/>telligence to the Six Nations. About 11
                    o'clock,<lb/> we were all on board. My mind felt sorrowful, in<lb/><pb n="150"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_150"/> reflecting on the important subject of our
                    journey.<lb/>But on turning my mind to consider, if we had omit-<lb/>ted any
                    thing we might have done, or what might<lb/>yet remain to be done, nothing
                    appeared to give un-<lb/>easiness. I therefore rested satisfied in leaving
                    it<lb/> to the Lord, who judgeth righteously; and with joy<lb/> turned mine eye
                    homeward, willing to leave a set-<lb/>tlement so greatly dissipated with every

                    <lb/>parts swampy — others high, and suitable for wheat —<lb/>abounding with
                    limestone, sugar trees, bass wood, <lb/>beech, and shellbark hickory — and about
                    twenty <lb/>miles of plains. In which distance, are three fine <lb/>streams for
                    mills, with excellent fall. Two as large <lb/>as one of the forks of <geogName
                        key="brand">Brandywine</geogName>, the other as large <lb/>as <geogName
                        key="wclay">Whiteclay creek</geogName>. In the swamps and timber <lb/>lands,
                    the path was rendered difficult by hundreds <lb/>of logs across the way. We met
                    one Indian on the <lb/>plains, he was pleased to see us — we gave him some
                    <lb/>refreshment. Came across <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> and
                    his fami-<lb/>ly, in the woods — he was indisposed — <persName key="jparr1">John

                    <lb/>armed men, who looked grim. We pressed forward <lb/>as far as possible,
                    fearing they might covet one of <lb/>our horses. A little after sun-set, we
                    turned out our <lb/>horses at the east end of the great plains, kindled a
                    <lb/>fire, and began to model a tent; when sable clouds <lb/>obscured the azure
                    sky, and made an awful appear-<lb/>ance, which was soon succeeded by tremendous
                    peals <lb/>of thunder, boisterous wind, and heavy rain. Many <lb/>trees were
                    blown down. We stood exposed to the <lb/>vehemence of the elements, without any
                    shelter, <lb/><pb n="153" facs="SW_JL1793_Page_153"/> not daring to stand by
                    trees, for fear of lightning. <lb/>It lasted near three hours, then cleared
                    away.</p>
                <p>After this dreadful storm was over, we renewed <lb/>our fire, which was almost
                    extinguished by the rain, <lb/>lay down on the wet ground in our wet clothes,
                    <lb/>contemplated the wondrous beauty of our spangled <lb/>canopy, and rested
                    some, having rode forty miles <lb/>the preceding day. </p></div>

                <p>Resumed our journey through a swampy,
                    <lb/>dreary wilderness, for above twenty miles, inter-<lb/>spersed with some
                    ridges of very rich land. Passed <lb/>over a fine stream for water works, where
                    the water <lb/>pitches off a fine limestone rock, six or seven feet at
                    <lb/>once. The banks are low and rich. Sometime after, <lb/>passed over about
                    ten miles of plains, in which is a <lb/>curious spring, covering an acre and a
                    half; the fall <lb/>from it is rapid; — the stream as large as <geogName
                        key="wclay">Whiteclay <lb/>creek</geogName>. Then passed through an Indian
                    village, on <lb/>the flats of the <geogName key="genes2">Genessee
                        river</geogName>: which exceeds any <lb/>land I have seen for richness — the

                    horse-<lb/>back. Thousands of acres fit for mowing — of which <lb/>a great deal
                    is cut, and makes excellent fodder, the <lb/>pods and peas contributing thereto.
                    We forded the <lb/>river, now about as large as <geogName key="brand"
                        >Brandywine</geogName>. This <lb/>place is thirty miles south of <placeName

                <p>Here we were refreshed, refitted, and
                    pre-<lb/>pared to pursue our journey. Here many Indians <lb/>resort — one old
                    woman, supposed to exceed one <lb/>hundred years — I admired her gray head. She
                    said <lb/>she was always kind and good, and always against <lb/><pb n="154"
                        facs="SW_JL1793_Page_154"/> quarrels; therefore God had spared her to see
                    the <lb/>sun a long time. </p>
                <p>The land west of <geogName key="genes2">Genessee</geogName>, belongs to the

                    out the way. After alighting,<lb/>scrabbling for some distance through mud,
                    bushes, <lb/>&amp;c. we were obliged to give up the idea of reaching <lb/>the
                    stage. Tied the horses to the bushes, very hun-<lb/>gry, as were ourselves also.
                        <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> struck <lb/>fire, which with
                    much difficulty, we augmented into <lb/>a blaze — blundered in the dark for
                    wood, and at <lb/>length got a comfortable fire. Laid down in our wet
                    <lb/>blankets and clothes; it having rained most of the <lb/>preceding day, the
                    ground was moist. </p></div>

                <p>Rose early, all in health, and rode about two
                    <lb/>miles to the <placeName key="block">Block-house</placeName>, about
                    thirty-seven miles <lb/>from <persName key="clind2">Col. Lindley</persName>'s.
                    Breakfasted, and fed our horses <lb/>well; then resumed our journey, seventeen
                    miles, to <lb/><persName key="jkyle1">Kyle</persName>'s, on <geogName
                        key="lycom">Lycoming creek</geogName>. The road mountainous <lb/>and rough.
                    Dined, and rode fourteen miles, to <persName key="jwint1"
                        >Win-<lb/>ters</persName>'s. My mare very lame, having wrenched off <lb/>two
                    of her shoes in the mountains, forty miles back. <lb/>Here we got our horses
                    shod, and lodged. </p></div>

                        >Northumberland</placeName>, a town of about <lb/>thirty houses, pleasantly

                <p>Set out — crossed the <geogName key="westb"
                        >west branch</geogName> — rode <lb/>down the west side of the river to
                        <geogName key="lcross">Litle</geogName>'s ferry, <lb/>where I rode the
                    river: having travelled thirty-one <lb/>miles. Lodged at <persName key="mbowe1"
                        >Michael Bowers</persName>'s, whose wife is <lb/>a daughter of <persName
                        key="clane1">Cornelius Lane</persName>, and desired her love <lb/>to

                <p><geogName key="lcross">Litle</geogName>'s ferry is twenty miles from <placeName

                <p> Hence the company proceeded to their several <lb/>homes — having been absent on
                    this toilsome, exer-<lb/>cising journey, about four months and a half.
