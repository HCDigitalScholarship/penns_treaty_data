                <p> Rode over and through the gap in several <lb/>mountains, past a furnace known by
                    the name of <lb/>Kittera's. The precipices on both right and left of <lb/>one of
                    them exhibited a magnificent appearance. <lb/>After which we entered a limestone
                    valley of good <lb/>land, though not improved, as I apprehended, in the
                    <lb/>best manner. Fed our horses at the stone tavern, <lb/>sixteen miles; [then]
                    to <placeName key="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName> twelve and <lb/>one-half
                    miles, part of which, notwithstanding it was <lb/>in the valley, appeared to be
                    very poor, covered with <lb/>pine of small growth and barren oaks. A few miles
                    <lb/>before we reached <placeName key="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName> we passed
                    through <lb/>some excellent wheat land, being covered with black <lb/>oak and
                    hickory. Dined at <placeName key="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName>. The
                    gen-<lb/>eral part of the corn thus far very poor; buckwheat, <lb/>in some
                    place, pretty good. Then proceeded to a <lb/>small village called <placeName
                        key="stras">Strasburg</placeName>, ten miles; through <lb/>tolerable land
                    but no water which I thought fit to <lb/>drink for myself or horse for twenty
                    miles. Then <lb/>ascended the mountain called the Blue Ridge, the <lb/>ascent
                    and descent of which is three miles, affording <lb/>a prospect which shows the
                    wonderful works of the <lb/>Author of Nature. Crossed a branch of the <geogName
                        key="conod">Conodo-<lb/>guinet</geogName> running to the right, and lodged
                    at <persName key="jskin1">Skinner's</persName>
                    <lb/>in <geogName key="horsv">Horse Valley</geogName>. This day's ride,
                    forty-one and a<lb/> half miles.</p>

                    <placeName key="checkPlace"/></dateline>
                <p> In the morning, ascended and descended <lb/>two large mountains, the valley
                    between them called <lb/><geogName key="pathv">Path Valley</geogName>, in which
                    is a small village called <placeName key="ferri">Ferris-<lb/>burg</placeName>;
                    it being seven miles across those two moun-<lb/>tains. In the aforesaid valley
                    is a fine stream run-<lb/>ning to the right, called <geogName key="conoc"
                        >Conogocheak [Conoco-<lb/>cheague]</geogName>; and a pretty good settlement.
                    After <lb/>crossing the mountains, very poor broken land thinly <lb/>inhabited,
                    to <placeName key="flitt">Fort Littleton</placeName>, twelve miles from
                        <lb/><persName key="jskin1">Skinner's</persName>; here we breakfasted. In
                    crossing those <lb/>mountains and valleys my mind was much em-<lb/>ployed in
                    contemplating the wonderful works of an <lb/>all-wise Creator.</p>
                <p> To <persName key="jskin1">John Skinner's</persName> on the top of <geogName
                        key="sidel">Sidling Hill</geogName>, <lb/>eleven miles, being a tremendous
                    mountain, on the <lb/>ridge of which we rode about four miles; at the end
                    <lb/>thereof, and descending the mountain, a grand pros-<lb/>pect opened of the
                        <geogName key="allmo">Allegheny Mountain</geogName> and what<lb/> appeared a
                    tolerably level valley, considerably im-<lb/>proved with plantations; but in
                    riding through it we <lb/>found it to be very hilly, approached to mountains;
                    <lb/>then crossed a branch of <geogName key="junia">Juniata</geogName>, running
                    to the <lb/>right, and rode to <persName key="hart1">Hartley's</persName>, where
                    we expect to lodge. <lb/>The river was frequently on our right hand and
                    fre-<lb/>quently near our left hand, and we on an eminence <lb/>perhaps of one
                    or two hundred feet, some place ap-<lb/>proaching near perpendicular. This day's
                    ride, thir-<lb/>ty-nine miles.</p>

                <p> Rode up the valley through some tolerably <lb/>good limestone land to <placeName
                        key="bedfo">Bedford</placeName>, six miles; crossed two <lb/>branches of the
                    aforesaid water. After leaving <placeName key="bedfo">Bed-<lb/>ford</placeName>
                    passed through a gap in <geogName key="wilmo">Wills' Mountain</geogName> and

                    oats growing of a good length; some <lb/>ripe, some almost ripe, and some
                    standing in shock. <lb/>From thence to <placeName key="berli"
                    >Berlin</placeName>, thirteen miles. On our way <lb/>we met an old man who had
                    just killed a large buck <lb/>which had horns with a number of prongs, covered
                    <lb/>with the velvet, which he had skinned and had some <lb/>
                    <pb n="453" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_02"/> of the meat tied up in it carrying about
                    his neck in <lb/>the manner of a knapsack. In riding six miles we <lb/>came to
                    the foot of the great <geogName key="allmo">Allegheny mountains</geogName>
                    <lb/>where is some good land; buckwheat and oats about <lb/>of an equal
                    ripeness, both good, but the buckwheat <lb/>extraordinary; as much so as I think
                    I have ever <lb/>seen. The ascent of this mountain better land than <lb/>any of
                    the others, being covered with lofty timber of <lb/>divers sorts, and on the top
                    of said mountain got some <lb/>excellent water, being the first I have met with
                    since <lb/>I left home. After we got over the mountains the <lb/>timber was very
                    thick but much destroyed with fire. <lb/>Two or three miles before we came to
                        <placeName key="berli">Berlin</placeName> the land <lb/>appeared to be
                    excellent, covered with heavy timber, <lb/>black oak, white oak, red oak,
                    hickory, and sugar <lb/>maple, grass and other vegetables very flourishing, it
                    <lb/>having been a wet growing season. This day's ride, <lb/>thirty-six
                    miles.</p>

                <p> Took an early set-off from <placeName key="berli">Berlin</placeName>, being a
                    <lb/>village of about 50 houses; passed through some very <lb/>rough lands and
                    roads on which I saw a rattlesnake <lb/>about three feet long with ten rattles,
                    lying in the <lb/>road, appearing to have been just killed by a wagon-<lb/>wheel
                    running over it. Part of the way to this stage <lb/>the land was covered with
                    most beautiful lofty chest-<lb/>nuts, and part of the way very thick set with
                    white <lb/>pine, being thirteen miles; [reached] a Dutch tavern <lb/>where we
                    thought best to breakfast on our own choco-<lb/>late. From thence to <persName
                        key="gbach1">George Bachelor's</persName>, fourteen <lb/>miles in which we
                    crossed what is called <geogName key="laure">Laurel Hill</geogName>, <lb/>being
                    one mountain after another for seven or eight <lb/>miles of the way. The ascent
                    of one of them ex-<lb/>ceeded all for chestnut timber I ever saw; they stand
                    <lb/>so thick together and are so tall that I fully believe <lb/>there are
                    thousands of acres that would yield more <lb/>than 10,000 rails to the acre.
                    Almost all those moun-<lb/>tains that go by the aforesaid name are the most
                    fer-<lb/>tile of any I have yet seen; the trees and vegetables <lb/>of every
                    kind are so luxuriant I could not help feel-<lb/>ing some attachment to the
                    place; but when I con-<lb/>sidered the exceeding rough mountainous face of the
                    <lb/>surface and the intolerable road to and from the <lb/>place, I am content
                    if I should live to return to spend <lb/>the remainder of my days in <placeName

                    sixteen miles. Nothing very remark-<lb/>able the last stage, except in one place
                    about six miles <lb/>back, we rose to or on an eminence where a grand
                    <lb/>prospect opened to view, to the east, the north, and <lb/>the west,
                    particularly to the west where we could see <lb/>as far as the eye could reach-I

                    <lb/>some fifty feet long and twelve wide, in which they <lb/>will carry 360

                <p> Crossed the <geogName key="yough">Yoghogany</geogName>, being a small river,
                    <lb/>perhaps hal fas large as <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> above
                    the Falls. <lb/>About a mile from said river as we rode up a small <lb/>stream
                    large enough to turn a mill, we came to a curi-<lb/>ous limestone rock lying
                    horizontal, about three feet <lb/>thick, forming a concave semi-circle of
                    perhaps 300 <lb/>feet, near the centre of which the water fell about <lb/>
                    twenty-eight feet there being a walk on another rock <lb/>about twelve feet
                    below the other, and near the same <lb/>distance deep back behind the water
                    where we might <lb/>safely walk. Just at one side and near the centre of<lb/>the
                    semi-circle a spacious grist mill is built butting up <lb/>against the rock.
                    Then passed over many hills and <lb/>valleys to <persName key="rcadw1">Reese
                        Cadwallader,s</persName>, twenty miles. Passed <lb/>a new paper-mill
                    occupied by <persName key="jshar3">Jonathan Sharpless</persName>, on
                        <lb/><geogName key="redst">Redstone creek</geogName>; also <persName
                        key="sjack1">Samuel Jackson's</persName> grist mill at <lb/>the mouth of
                    said creek, over which there is a large <lb/>bridge, near thirty feet high, wide
                    enough for a wagon <lb/>to cross. We were expecting to find a road in
                    pro-<lb/>portion; but immediately after getting over we found <lb/>ourselves on
                    a narrow path perhaps not more than <lb/>five feet wide, and a precipice on our
                    left hand down to <lb/>
                    <geogName key="redst">Redstone creek</geogName>, and on our right hand down to
                    <lb/>the <geogName key="monon">Monongahela river</geogName>, each of them near
                    perpen-<lb/>dicular, which was near 200 feet, which to some of <lb/>our company
                    was truly alarming; and I believe <lb/>would have been more so had it not been
                    that a <lb/>bulky woman rode on just before us seemingly with-<lb/>out care or
                    fear. Then rode up the last mentioned <lb/>river through a beautiful town on the
                    bank of the <lb/>same, perhaps of forty or fifty houses. This river I <lb/>think
                    is larger than <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName>, running to the
                    right. <lb/>The land thus far through the Redstone settlement is <lb/>very rough
                    and mountainous, and appears to be very <lb/>fertile, producing wheat, rye,
                    oats, buckwheat, and <lb/>grass in abundance even on the top of the hills, and
                    <lb/>abundance of lofty timber of many sorts, particularly <lb/>sugar maple and
                    white oak. But notwithstanding it <lb/>hath been a very wet growing season and
                    all kinds of <lb/>grain in the ground and vegetables look luxuriant, <lb/>yet
                    the waters are very low, which induces me to <lb/>believe that, when the land
                    comes to be more gener-<lb/>ally cleared and a dry season takes place (which I
                    <lb/>suppose frequently does), the inhabitants will suffer <lb/>from lack of
                    water. The reason in part as I take it, <lb/>of the water's failing so much is a
                    horizontal rock <lb/>which lies a little underground, I believe, over much
                    <lb/>of the country.</p>

                    fifteen miles. About <lb/>one mile from Barclay's is a sawmill occupied and

                    <lb/>No great variations in the land except gradually de-<lb/>clining towards
                    poor land. When we arrived on the <lb/>top of the mountain, where we got the

                    to descend the steepest hill <lb/>I ever saw a wagon road upon, which to me

                    up. Nevertheless the inhabitants say <lb/> they frequently go up loaded. When we

                    three miles after crossing, we rode <lb/>through the richest piece of land I
                    think I ever be-<lb/>held, for so much. The stately walnuts [were] four
                    <lb/>feet through, and a great length, and other timber in <lb/>proportion,
                    every herb and plant appearing as luxu-<lb/>riant as if it had grown out of a
                    dung heap. Soon <lb/>after that, a declension of soil took place and
                    pro-<lb/>gressed until it became, as I thought, very poor, <lb/>rough, and
                    hilly, until we came to one Duncan's,
                    <lb/>where we fed our horses and dined from the supply <lb/>of our bags, it
                    being eighteen miles; from thence to<lb/> one <persName key="bove1"
                        >Bovear's</persName>, where three of our company lodged. <lb/><persName
                        key="jcoop1">James Cooper</persName> and myself rode six miles further to
                    <lb/>my cousin, <persName key="acoat1">Abner Coats's</persName>, who is just
                    newly settled in <lb/>the woods; has got about ten acres of land cleared
                    <lb/>and seems in a likely way to make a living. He was <lb/>very kind and glad
                    to see me; tied up our horses, <lb/>fed them with bran and cut corn-tops, with
                    which <lb/>they seemed to do very well. All this stage appeared <lb/>to me to be
                    very poor, until we turned off the road <lb/>and got near <persName key="acoat1"
                        >Abner's</persName>, where the land appears tolera-<lb/>bly level and pretty
                    good soil. We crossed one large <lb/>and one lesser stream running to the right,
                    called <lb/><geogName key="conyc">Conyconeys</geogName>. Divers places the road
                    was intolerable <lb/>for short steep hills,--so much so that going down
                    <lb/>some of them, leading our horses, we seemed in dan-<lb/>ger of their
                    falling down upon us. This day, rode <lb/>thirty-four miles.</p>

                    we arrived <lb/>about two in the afternoon; appearing to be good quar-<lb/>ters
                    for ourselves and horses, we stayed all night, and <lb/>lodged comfortably in

                    <note resp="editor">[country <lb/>seat of Venango county, Pa.]</note>, a small

                    thirteen miles. The most of <lb/>this stage is stony chestnut land. About four
                    miles <lb/>before we got to <placeName key="frank">Franklin</placeName>, we
                    crossed <geogName key="sandy">Sandy Creek</geogName>, <lb/>the descent and

                    and in <lb/>some places, I think near forty-five degrees of eleva-<lb/>tion.
                    Going down the hill I discovered my mare had <lb/>lost one of her shoes, and by
                    the time I got to this <lb/>place she began to limp pretty much, and no smith
                    <lb/>here. The prospect looks dull to proceed from here <lb/>to <persName

                        >Allegheny river</geogName>, for so much; some bottoms, very <lb/>rich
                    abounding with plums, some of it rather too <lb/>much upon a dead level to be
                    very good for wheat, <lb/>and exceeding thick set with small timber,
                    partic-<lb/>larly quaking asp. About twelve miles from <placeName key="frank"
                        >Frank-<lb/>lin</placeName> we came across a cabin and a few acres of
                    <lb/>ground cleared, where the people looked clean and <lb/>decent; had
                    abundance of watermelons with which <lb/>they regaled us plentifully without
                    charge. A few <lb/>more cabins and small lots cleared we saw on our way
                    <lb/>between <geogName key="french">French Creek</geogName> and <geogName
                        key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName>. Rattlesnakes <lb/>abound here. I saw a

                    wrist. I <lb/>alighted and killed it; cut off the rattles, being nine.
                    <lb/>Great numbers of wild tur-<lb/>keys are here; we saw several flocks
                    containing forty <lb/>or more and might easily have shot some of them if <lb/>we
                    had had guns and ammunition.</p>
                <p> We arrived at <persName key="jtitu1">Titus's</persName> a little before sunset;

                    acres of land, the most of it a rich bottom; <lb/>has got about twenty-six acres
                    of excellent corn in <lb/>the ground, a considerable quantity of wheat in stack;
                    <lb/>a spring of excellent water near the door, large enough <lb/>to turn a
                    breast-mill; so that upon the whole I think <lb/>this farm likely in time to be
                    of most inestimable <lb/>value, <geogName key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName> being

                <p> Being a fine morning, we set off early and <lb/>rode twenty-nine miles near the
                    mouth of a large <lb/>stream called <geogName key="broke"
                    >Brokenstraw</geogName>, where we pitched our <lb/>tent, kindled a fire, and
                    lodged in the woods. I am <lb/>not furnished with language or memory to describe
                    <lb/>the particulars of this day's journey, but may en-<lb/>deavor to note some
                    particulars. After leaving <persName key="jtitu1">Titus's</persName>
                    <lb/>we rode two miles to a newly erected mill and saw-<lb/>mill on a branch of
                        <geogName key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName>, which the Holland <lb/>Company
                    have erected in order to supply the new <lb/>settlers with flour, etc., and
                    divers of them come there <lb/>twenty, twenty-five, and more miles with bags of
                    <lb/>grain on a horse, to be ground; there being no road <lb/>that any carriage
                    can pass, and indeed, (to such who <lb/>have not seen those mountainous new
                    countries), it <lb/>would appear to impraticable to pass with a single
                    <lb/>horse. After leaving the mill we soon entered a<lb/>forest of white pine,
                    hemlock and divers other sorts <lb/>of timber not necessary to mention, and
                    great part of <lb/>our ride this day was through timber of that sort; <lb/>some
                    of the way tolerably level, but a great part of it <lb/>such mountains thickly
                    set with stones and rocks, <lb/>which together with the interlocking of the
                    roots <lb/>of the timber, a little comparable to a corn-rid-<lb/>dle, and the
                    deep swampy guts, it was with difficulty <lb/>we got along over roots and rock
                    the cavities be-<lb/>tween them being so deep and so close together that<lb/>had
                    our horses got their legs in, (and this to appear-<lb/>ance seemed almost
                    unavoidable), they must have <lb/>been broken. But I suppose the way to be much
                    bet-<lb/>ter than it was two years ago, being now a cut path <lb/>all the way,
                    which was not the case then. In many <lb/>places the timber is, I believe, from
                    one hundred to <lb/>two hundred feet high, and thickly set, insomuch that <lb/>a
                    great part of the face of the ground and rocks <lb/>is scarcely ever saluted
                    with the luminous rays of the <lb/>sun, which I think is the reason of the rocks
                    and old <lb/>logs being very thick set with coats of moss; and as <lb/> the seed
                    of different kinds of trees falls on this moss <lb/>which the rocks and old logs
                    contain, there being <lb/>moisture enough contained in it to occasion a
                    vegeta-<lb/>tion, the body or trunk ascends and the roots crawl<lb/> on the
                    surface of the rock or log to the edge, and then <lb/>descend into the gorund,
                    and great numbers of that <lb/>description are grown into large trees the roots
                    of <lb/>which clasp a rock a little similar to the clasp of an <lb/>eagles claw;
                    and on many of these rocks there are <lb/>several trees. I saw one rock about
                    twenty feet in <lb/>diameter, which had seven trees on it, some of <lb/>which
                    were two or three feet over and perhaps <lb/>one hundred and fifty feet high and
                    the rock <lb/>ten or twelve feet high. I think we saw neither <lb/>house nor
                    improvement for twenty miles; neither <lb/>can I suppose much of it will be
                    settled for many <lb/>years to come, We came on the <geogName key="broke"
                        >Brokenstraw</geogName> about<lb/> seven miles above the mouth and rode sixe
                    miles down <lb/>the stream to the place of our encampment, through <lb/>a very
                    rich bottom. As I rode along this day <lb/>I frequently experienced a transition
                    of ideas; <lb/>while passing through the dark shades of the thick <lb/>and lofty
                    timber which sometimes appeared like a <lb/>desolate, gloomy wilderness
                    comparable to the gloom <lb/>of eternal night; and other times so great, so
                    grand, <lb/>so magnificent that it became truly transporting.</p>

                <p> Set off early, without taking breakfast or <lb/>feeding our horses. Rode down
                    the aforesaid creek <lb/>almost to the mouth and with some difficulty got
                    <lb/>along, the Indian path up the river being in many <lb/>places hard to be
                    discovered, to a place called <placeName key="warre"
                        >War-<lb/>ren</placeName><note resp="editor"> [now the county seat of Warren

                    ex-<lb/>cept one cabin and a storehouse built by the Hol<lb/>land Company near
                    the mouth of another large <lb/>stream called <geogName key="concr"
                        >Connowongo</geogName>. Here we breakfasted <lb/>and fed our horses. The
                    people in the cabin were <lb/>very kind, made our chocolate for us and gave us
                    <lb/>some good pigeon soup. [Distance] nine miles. Here <lb/>we hired a guide;
                    rode over the <geogName key="concr">Connowongo</geogName>, and <lb/>followed our
                    guide with undescribable difficulty <lb/>about sixteen miles to <placeName

                    and thick-set young timber rendered <lb/>this stage extremely difficult and
                    tiresome; almost a <lb/>continual succession of logs, in many places three or
                    <lb/>four in a perch, as high as our horses could step over, <lb/>and many of
                    them they had to jump; and the young <lb/>growth being so thick that if we were
                    two rods apart <lb/>we would have to call out to each other in fear of
                    be-<lb/>ing lost. About an hour before sunset we reached the <lb/>new house

                    to our mutual comfort, and where we tarried <lb/>all night in the schoolhouse.
                    At this place there are <lb/>several comfortable houses building, it being about

                <p> This morning the old chief and some of his <lb/>connections brought us some
                    cucumbers to help out <lb/>our breakfast, and immediately returned to his

                <p> Stayed with our friends and visited several <lb/>families of Indians in their
                    houses and cabins. One <lb/>Indian, <persName key="ijohn1">John</persName>, has
                    built himself a snug house and <lb/>kitchen, the logs well-hewn and the joists
                    and boards <lb/>planed, [with] sash and glass windows. He has <lb/>mowed and
                    made two good stacks of hay, fenced in <lb/>several acres of ground in which he
                    has good corn; <lb/>and several others of them are improving in their
                    <lb/>buildings, fencing, etc. We have fared very well <lb/>this day on provision

                    walked about and reviewed the improve-<lb/>ment made by our young friends in
                    this wilderness <lb/>country, which appears considerable. And although<lb/>I
                    think the spot they are settled upon is much infer-<lb/>ior to many other places
                    in these parts for fertility, <lb/>yet their corn and buckwheat are good; [they]
                    had <lb/>pretty good oats, have a considerable quantity of hay <lb/>procured, a
                    large garden of good vegetables, and have <lb/>about five acres of ground
                    cleared and plowed ready <lb/>to sow wheat. They have got a comfortable
                    two-<lb/>story house to live in, and several other necessary<lb/>buildings.</p>

                        <p> Brothers, I am glad the good Spirit has favored <lb/>you all with health
                            in your long journey to come and <lb/>see us and take us by the hand, so

                        <p> "Brothers, you have now heard that our coming <lb/>here was to see how
                            you and our young men who <lb/>live amongst you are getting along. We
                            are glad the <lb/>Good Spirit has favored us to meet you in health, and
                            <lb/>given us this opportunity of taking you by the hand <lb/>and
                            brightening the chain of friendship. Now broth-<lb/>ers, we should like
                            to hear from your own mouths if <lb/>you are quite satisfied with our
                            young men living <lb/>amongst you. They came here with a hope of being
                            <lb/>useful, by instructing you in a better way of manag-<lb/>ing your
                            land and providing for yourselves and your <lb/>cattle. We desire you to
                            speak freely brothers. It <lb/>has been some satisfaction to us in
                            riding through <lb/>your town to see marks of industry taking place;
                            that <lb/>you are building better and warmer houses to live in; <lb/>and
                            that so much of your cleared land is planted with <lb/>corn, potatoes,
                            beans, squashes, cucumbers, etc., and <lb/>to see these articles kept in
                            good order. Brothers, we <lb/>observe where your new houses are
                            building, that the <lb/>timber is very much cut off a rich flat which we
                            wish <lb/>you encouraged to clear and make it fit for plowing. <lb/>We
                            believe it to be very good land for wheat, as well <lb/>as corn, and as
                            the white people are settling around <lb/>you, the deer and other wild
                            game will grow scarce <lb/>and more difficult to be taken. We therefore
                            hope <lb/>that more of your men will assist in clearing land,
                            <lb/>fencing it, planting it with corn, and sowing it with <lb/>wheat.
                            You will then have a supply of provision <lb/>more certain to depend
                            upon than hunting. Broth-<lb/>ers, we were pleased to see your stock of
                            cattle in-<lb/>creased; the rich bottoms on the river will be plenty
                            <lb/>for them to live on in the summer season, but as your <lb/>winters
                            are long and cold, it will require something <lb/>for them to live on in
                            the winter. Now the white <lb/>people keep their cattle on hay, on straw
                            and on <lb/>corn-fodder. Straw you cannot get until you raise <lb/>wheat
                            or other grain; the rich bottoms, if they were <lb/>put in order, would
                            produce a great deal of hay; but <lb/>for an immediate supply, we think,
                            if as soon as you <lb/>gather your corn you would cut the stalks close
                            at <lb/>the ground, bind them up in small bundles, and put <lb/>them in
                            stack, as our young men do, they would keep <lb/>the cattle part of the
                            cold weather. Brothers, we <lb/>are glad to see a quantity of new fence
                            made this <lb/>summer, near where our young men live, and we <lb/>would
                            not have you get discouraged at the labor it <lb/>takes; for if you will
                            clear a little more land every <lb/>year and fence it, you will soon get
                            enough to raise <lb/>what bread you want, as well as some for grass to
                            <lb/>make hay for winter. Brothers, we understand you <lb/>are desirous
                            to discourage whiskey from being <lb/>brought amongst you, with which we
                            are much <lb/>pleased, and should be glad you could entirely keep
                            <lb/>it away; for to get it, you give your money which <lb/>you should
                            have to buy clothes with, and to buy <lb/>oxen and plows with to work
                            your land; and it does <lb/>not do you any good."</p>

                <p> After which a solemn silence took place, in which <lb/>I thought I felt love to
                    flow to the poor natives, <lb/>accompanied by a strong desire that they might be
                    <lb/>prevailed upon to wholly decline the drinking of <lb/>distilled spirits;
                    for truly I think until some reforma-<lb/>tion in that respect takes place
                    amongst them, the <lb/>solid ground on which we can expect their
                    profit-<lb/>able civilization is small; and though I felt as I did, <lb/>it
                    seemed discouraging to offer anything to them on <lb/>the occasion, considering
                    my own inability and the <lb/>imperfect interpreter we had--being one who hath a

                            see you, believe that the Great <lb/>Spirit made both white men and red
                            men, and placed <lb/>them on this great island, gave them many good
                            <lb/>things to live upon such as grain, flesh, fruit, etc., and <lb/>
                            <pb n="483" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_08"/> also gave them understanding
                            hearts. And we also <lb/>believe that his design or intention was that
                            we <lb/>should love and serve him, and not only love him <lb/>and our
                            own people but love and be at peace with all <lb/>people of all nations
                            and colors. But some white <lb/>men became very cunning and sought out
                            new inven-<lb/>tions, one of which was making rum, whiskey, <lb/>brandy,
                            etc., out of the good things that he had given <lb/>them, which at first
                            was used in very small quantities <lb/>as medicine; but as it became
                            more plenty, many <lb/>white men got to love it and drink more of it
                            inso-<lb/>much that they became drunk and neglected their <lb/>business;
                            many of their wives and children suffered <lb/>in want of food and
                            clothing, and it seemed to be the <lb/>beginner or forerunner of almost
                            every bad practice.</p>
                        <p> Now brothers, some of your friends, the Quakers, <lb/>many years since
                            were favored to see the mischief <lb/>that rum and whiskey had done, and
                            believed it right <lb/>for them not to drink any more, and have found by
                            <lb/>more than twenty years' experience that they can do <lb/>better
                            without it than with it. And seeing the mis-<lb/>chief it did to others,
                            and how much better they <lb/>themselves did without it, believed it
                            right to per-<lb/>suade others to do so too; and as we love our Indian
                            <lb/>brothers, and seeing their land is much sold and <lb/>white people
                            settling all round them whereby the <lb/>deer and other game is likely
                            to become so scarce <lb/>that they cannot live by hunting much longer,
                            we <lb/>were drawn in compassion to invite some of our young <lb/>men to
                            come and live amongst you, in order to in-<lb/>struct you in the useful
                            ways of the white people who <lb/>have now been some time with you. But
                            we under-<lb/>stand that some bad white men let Indians have
                            <lb/>whiskey and that many of them love it so much that <lb/>they often
                            get drunk and are wicked. Brothers, we <lb/>wish you would not hearken
                            to those bad men who <lb/>want you to buy their whiskey, nor give way to
                            your <lb/>own love for it, but stand against it and not use any <lb/>of
                            it; for if you do, your friends, the Quakers, will <lb/>be discouraged
                            and hang down their heads and go <lb/>and leave you. But if you will
                            stand against it and <lb/>not use it, become sober men, they will be
                            willing to <lb/>assist and instruct you what they can.</p>

                <p> I believe the interpreter endeavored to render it <lb/>into the Indian language
                    as well as he could, though <lb/>he appeared somewhat convicted; and I also
                    think <lb/>they understood it pretty well, as there appeared a <lb/>general
                    concurrence by their usual nod and sound on <lb/>such occasions, and by what the
                    old chief said to us <lb/>after, on our asking them if they had anything to say
                    <lb/>to us, he replied that <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName> had
                    told him <lb/>some time ago that he intended to go home this fall, <lb/>(Henry
                    having taught school at <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanter's
                    village</placeName>), <lb/>and that he could not give us an answer until he knew
                    <lb/>whether Henry would go or not. We then agreed to <lb/>be a little time by
                    ourselves. They left us a few min-<lb/>utes and we laid the matter close to
                        <persName key="hsimm1">Henry</persName>. He then <lb/>told us that he
                    believed it was his duty to come here <lb/>and he now believed it was his place
                    to go home, <lb/>which we could not gainsay, though we felt sorry the
                    <lb/>Indian children should be left without an instructor. <lb/>The chiefs were
                    called in again, and tenderly informed <lb/>of Henry's intention of returning.
                        <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> then <lb/>replied if it was
                    right, he could not say against it, but <lb/>was afraid he should not have help
                    enough to keep <lb/>away the whiskey, as Henry had been a great help to <lb/>him
                    in that, and that he thought the Indians would <lb/>now mind him more than they
                    would one of them; <lb/>and then said that when our young men came first
                    <lb/>amongst them some of their warriors did not like it, <lb/>but now he
                    believed they all liked it, and all <lb/>spoke very well of them, and wished the
                    young <lb/>men to tell us if any of the young Indians or others <lb/>behaved bad
                    to them. They then all rose up and in <lb/>a friendly manner shook hands with us
                    and did what <lb/>they call "cover the council fire." Then one of their
                    <lb/>women brought in a large loaf of unleavened wheat <lb/>bread and a tin cup
                    full of pretty good butter, on <lb/>which we dined and took our departure up the
                    river. <lb/>Halliday Jackson, James Cooper, and myself walked, <lb/>the others
                    all went back in the canoes we came down in. <lb/>Arrived at the young men's
                    home just before sunset, <lb/>and lodged this night with them.</p>

                    time of this visit, was about 60 to <lb/>65 years old. He was of half-blood
                    only, the son of a white man <lb/>named <persName key="jobai1">John

                    Have not gone much
                    <lb/>out of the house to-day. Sat down with the young<lb/>men at their usual
                    time of holding their meeting, <lb/>which to me and I believe to others was a
                    solid, <lb/>strengthening time. A little after night, <persName key="jshar1"
                        >Joshua <lb/>Sharples</persName> went out of the house and just as he came
                    <lb/>in, the trap-door of the cellar being open, he stepped<lb/> in it and fell
                    with the back of his head against one of <lb/>the joists or sleepers, and so
                    down into the cellar. <lb/>We all made what haste we could down, finding him
                    <lb/>stunned and senseless. We were exceedingly <lb/>alarmed, got some camphor,
                    bathed his temples and <lb/>other places so that in about two or three minutes
                    <lb/>he came to so as to speak, but knew not that any-<lb/> thing was the
                    matter, or where he was, for a con-<lb/>siderable time. At length his
                    understanding re-<lb/>turned, but he could not all the evening recollect
                    <lb/>falling, being a good deal hurt. Our getting away <lb/>from her as soon as
                    we proposed, [now] looks doubt-<lb/> ful; but it is a great comfort to us to
                    find him as well <lb/>as he appears to be. Went to bed and I slept with <lb/>him
                    in some hopes he may be better in the morning.</p>

                   Joshua quite as well as we could expect,
                    <lb/>but not fit to travel. This day we have had a visit <lb/>from five or six
                    Indian chiefs who stayed with us <lb/>the most of the day and appeared very much
                    pleased <lb/>in being in our company and viewing a map which <lb/>we had with
                    us. Soon got to understand it so that <lb/>they could point out almost any of
                    the rivers and <lb/>lakes. About noon Cornplanter came and brought us <lb/>a
                    quarter of venison and two pigeons. Offered to <lb/>send some of his people to
                    pilot us to Buffalo, but we <lb/>could not tell him when we could go, not
                    knowing <lb/>when our friend would be able to travel. About the <lb/>middle of
                    the afternoon they all took an affectionate <lb/>farewell of us for the
                    present.</p>

                    A fine day. <persName key="jshar1"
                        >Joshua</persName> appearing some better, <lb/>eighteen or twenty of the
                    Indians came to see us and <lb/>bade us farewell. About one o'clock we set off,
                        <persName key="hjack1">Hal-<lb/>liday Jackson</persName> bearing us company.
                    We took an <lb/>affectionate farewell of our other two friends, after <lb/>an
                    uniting opportunity just before parting. Rode <lb/>about four miles up the river
                    through middling good <lb/>land to the house of one of the old chiefs who was
                    <lb/>with us yesterday, and who had his horse standing <lb/>hitched ready to
                    pilot us up the river to a small set-<lb/>tlement of Indians. On riding along we
                    discovered <lb/>they had the day before opened and cut the path <lb/>wider and
                    better for several miles just on our ac-<lb/>count; and on our way we passed a
                    new settlement, <lb/>made this summer by <persName key="halft1"
                        >Halftown</persName>, on some most excel-<lb/>lent land. Where he lives he
                    has cleared and fenced <lb/>two or three acres and got it in with corn and
                    vines. <lb/>After crossing the river we rode to another chief's <lb/>house where
                    there are several cabins, and pitched our <lb/>tent and lodged on the river
                    bank. They were kind <lb/>to us in their way, and gave us two very good
                    squir-<lb/> rels. This being ten miles up the river.</p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Being a rainy morning, we set off having
                        <lb/><persName key="sunfi1">Sunfish</persName> and <persName key="hjack1"
                        >Halliday Jackson</persName> for our guides, which <lb/>we found to be very
                    useful to use before night, it be-<lb/>ing a very wet day and much of the way so
                    swampy <lb/>and difficult that we should have been much beset <lb/>without them.
                    Abundance of the way through, the <lb/>wilderness is so stopped up with wind
                    falls of timber, <lb/>many of which are so large in low ground and fallen
                    <lb/>one on another for a mile together, that to a stranger <lb/>it would seem
                    altogether impassable. Many of these <lb/>with great difficulty we have to jump
                    our horses over, <lb/>and perhaps in mud half leg deep; and many of <lb/>them
                    were so large no horse could leap them. We <lb/>went up the river three miles
                    and then took up a <lb/>valley about twelve miles, down which a creek of
                    <lb/>about the size of our branch of Brandywine runs. <lb/>Excellent good land
                    all the way up, there being <lb/>abundance of sugar maple, beech, ash, birch,
                    and <lb/>bass. I have seen sugar maple in abundance that <lb/>were three feet
                    over and near one hundred feet high; <lb/>the other timber in proportion. We
                    then ascended <lb/>a very high mountain; good land up it, and on the <lb/>top
                    still good, being covered with very heavy, lofty <lb/>timber some of which is
                    white pine, some poplar, <lb/>and the other as before mentioned. Before we
                    as-<lb/>cended the mountain we came to the heads of springs<lb/>within a few
                    perches of each other, some of which<lb/>run into the <geogName key="alleg"
                        >Allegheny</geogName> and some into the <geogName key="catar"
                        >Cattarau-<lb/>gus</geogName>. The former empties into the <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>; the latter <lb/>into <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogName> and so down the river <geogName key="stlar">St.
                        Lawrence</geogName>. <lb/>In some places, abundance of wild cherry three and
                    <lb/>four feet in diameter, perhaps sixty and some eighty <lb/>feet to the first
                    limb. But as I do not intend to give <lb/>a minute description of the land,
                    water, and timber, <lb/>only to give a sketch of what appeared remarkable,
                    <lb/>suffice it to say that in this day's ride, (which was a <lb/>very wet one
                    through abundance of swampy land), I <lb/>think the land was generally good and
                    heavy loaded <lb/>with timber. This day's ride, twenty-four miles. <lb/>Pitched
                    our tent by a spring amongst lofty timber, <lb/>and just after we got our fire
                    made and tent raised, it <lb/>began to rain very fast, and was an exceeding wet
                    <lb/>night, accompanied with a great wind or storm inso-<lb/>much that we heard
                    the tree falling almost all <lb/>around us. Our situation appeared to be
                    somewhat <lb/>trying; but as we had no alternative, soon composed <lb/>oursevles
                    and went to sleep.</p>

                <p> It being likely for a fair <lb/>day, we set off, though the bushes were very
                    wet, and<lb/>rode to <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>, 27 miles, and
                    pitched our tent on <lb/>the margin thereof. We passed some very bad,
                    <lb/>swampy road in the morning. The timber and land <lb/>much as yesterday and
                    almost all the way, so far as <lb/>I have come through the New York State, there
                    ap-<lb/> pear to be very few stones. But after riding 8 or 10 <lb/>miles this
                    day, we came to abundance of the most <lb/>beautiful poplar trees I have ever
                    seen; and about <lb/>one mile before we crossed <geogName key="catar"
                        >Cattaraugus River</geogName> we <lb/>came into a bottom of very rich land,
                    wherein abun-<lb/>dance of black walnut stand, many of them three, <lb/>four,
                    five, and perhaps some six feet in diameter, and <lb/>sixty or severty feet to
                    the first limb. Crossed <geogName key="catar">Cat-<lb/>taraugus</geogName>,
                    being ten miles from our lodging, and rode <lb/>ten more to an Indian village.
                    Stopped awhile with <lb/>them, but as their chief was not at home we soon
                    <lb/>left them, and rode seven miles through a low piece <lb/>of land heavily
                    timbered with hemlock, sugar ma-<lb/>ple, etc., to the lake aforesaid, which, to
                    be sure, at <lb/>first view exhibited a grand prospect here in the
                    <lb/>wilderness, appearing both as to motion and sound <lb/>like the ocean. Had
                    a good supper of chocolate, <lb/>cooked by <persName key="hjack1"
                        >Halliday</persName>, who is yet with us; got a com-<lb/>fortable night's
                    sleep, and early in the morning, for <lb/>the first time, heard a wolf howl.</p>

                <p> Rode 28 miles down the lake on the beach <lb/>or margin thereof to the mouth of
                        <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogName>. <lb/>Crossed it in a boat
                    and swam our horses over, it be-<lb/>ing a very deep channel, about 30 or 40
                    yards wide. <lb/>Lodged at <persName key="jelic1">Joseph Elliot</persName>'s
                    headquarters, he being the <lb/>principal surveyor or superintendent of the
                    Holland <lb/>Company's business. Were kindly entertained free <lb/>of cost. This
                    day's ride down the lake was a de-<lb/>lightful journey, affording such a
                    variety of prospect <lb/>of the wonderful works of nature. Some places the
                    <lb/>land at the margin of the lake appeared to be pretty <lb/>level; in most
                    others there was a wall on our right <lb/>hand, in many places 50, some 60, and
                    some near, if <lb/>not quite, 100 feet high and almost perpendicular; <lb/>the
                    beach or margin from the water to the wall, <lb/>very diverse for width, some of
                    20 yards, some 10, <lb/>some 5, and in several places the wall butted into the
                    <lb/>water, where we several times had to ride in round <lb/>the points of rocks
                    knee-deep and sometimes belly-<lb/>deep; and in one or two places between a
                    large pyra-<lb/>mid of rock and the wall on the right, the pyramind
                    <lb/>appearing conical or in the form of a sugar loaf about <lb/>ten feet in
                    diameter at its base, and about twelve <lb/>feet high. These cones, I believe,
                    are made by the <lb/>dashing of waves, together with the freezing of <lb/>the
                    water in the winter, in the smooth joints of the <lb/>rocks, whereby abundance
                    of them fall down, parting <lb/> off from their fellows in smooth, perpendicular
                    <lb/>points. The high, perpendicular wall exhibits a curi-<lb/>ous view; the
                    stone appears to be principally com-<lb/>posed of slate and limestone in
                    different regular <lb/>strata of layers. The bottom or lowermost rocks that
                    <lb/> I discovered in most places are limestone, curiously <lb/>laid in a
                    horizontal form and nicely jointed in <lb/>squares of eight, ten, or twelve feet
                    in diameter, the<lb/>
                    <pb n="502" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_11"/> joints or vaccuums between them mostly
                    about an <lb/>inch wide. Some places we found them to extend into <lb/>the lake;
                    other places not quite to the edge of it; and <lb/>in others not within ten
                    yards of it. Where they ex-<lb/>tended to the lake, they formed a beautiful
                    level to <lb/>ride upon. The next layer or stratum is slate about <lb/>ten feet
                    perpendicular. In some places it appeared <lb/>very shelly or near rotten; in
                    many others, excel-<lb/>lent slate in great quantities either for flagging or
                    <lb/>covering for houses. Then one general layer of lime-<lb/>stone about
                    fifteen or eighteen inches thick; then <lb/>pretty generally slate or other
                    stone to the top of the <lb/>wall or abutment, all which are curiously jointed
                    in <lb/>smooth squares or columnes some two feet square, <lb/>some five, and
                    some in oblong squares two or three <lb/>feet by eight or ten. And as the water
                    in wet times <lb/>penetrates down those joints, I suppose it freezes in <lb/>the
                    winter and bursts off the columns, which fall <lb/>down on the margin of the
                    lake, in many places large <lb/>bodies of them together as much as several
                    square <lb/>rods, and the timber on the top with them. In many <lb/>places the
                    trees were hanging by one half of the<lb/>roots with their tops below a level,
                    and some right <lb/>top downwards and not touching the bottom. In <lb/>many
                    places by the continual dahsing of the waves <lb/> against the rocks they are
                    worn in curious forms.</p>

                <p> Rode three miles down on the margin of the <lb/>lake and <geogName key="niagr"
                        >river Niagara</geogName> to the ferry. No such curious <lb/>wall on our
                    right hand as yesterday, but similar beds <lb/>of limestone. This <geogName
                        key="niagr">Niagara River</geogName> is the great outlet <lb/>of all the
                    northwestern lakes and waters, which <lb/>makes a very great river above a mile
                    wide and of <lb/>great depth, running very rapidly. We crossed the <lb/>river in
                    a boat, which the heavy current drives across <lb/>in a few minutes, which to
                    some of our company ap-<lb/>peared a little terrifying; and then rode up on the
                    <lb/> margin of the lake on the other side about eight <lb/>miles, which appears
                    to be pretty level except some <lb/>very high banks of sand and a general bed of
                    lime-<lb/>stone lying in a form similar to the lower bed <lb/>on the other side.
                    Then turned off from the lake <lb/>about a mile to <persName key="dpoun1">Daniel
                        Pound</persName>'s, where four of us <lb/>dined and left some linen to be

                    <lb/>We then rode to <persName key="ascho1">Asa Schooly</persName>'s, where we

                    our kind friend and landlord appearing to have <lb/>things comfortably
                    convenient about him. They said <lb/>they could contrive for bedding for us all;
                    but <lb/><persName key="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName> and myself were
                    desirous to sleep <lb/>on the floor with our blankets, believing it would be
                    <lb/>best on several accounts; but we could not do it with-<lb/>out hurting our
                    friend's feelings, so consented to take <lb/>a bed. But when we got to the bed
                    chamber by our-<lb/>selves, we found a good clean bed and clothing, which
                    <lb/>we examined, and found a thin straw bed on the <lb/>sacking. We then took
                    off the feather bed and laid <lb/>it in the corner of the room, expecting we
                    should not <lb/>be discovered. But our kind friend came into the <lb/>room and
                    found the bed in the corner, but did not any <lb/>more insist upon our
                    compliance with their request.</p>

                <p> We all attended a confer-<lb/>ence before appointed to be held at Friends'
                    meeting-<lb/>house in <placeName key="pelh">Pelham township</placeName>,
                    otherwise the <placeName key="short">Short Hills</placeName>, <lb/>with the
                    members of said meeting and the Friends of <lb/><placeName key="blacc">Black
                        Creek</placeName>, which was conducted with great solem-<lb/>nity. In this
                    conference I was more fully convinced <lb/>that there is a small number of
                    seeking, religiously <lb/>minded Friends in both places, and that if they
                    <lb/>abode in the patience and perseverance, the way <lb/>would open ere long
                    for the establishment of a <lb/>monthly meeting amongst them. But the rest of my
                    <lb/>brethren believed the time was already come; so, <lb/> after expressing my
                    doubts of their being fully ripe <lb/>to be entrusted with the executive part of
                    our Disci-<lb/>pline at this time, I freely submitted my feelings to <lb/>the
                    judgment of those whom I esteem to be deeper <lb/>in the religious experience.
                    It was then agree to <lb/>open a new monthly meeting to-morrow at eleven
                    <lb/>o'clock, to be known by the name of <orgName key="meetpelh">Pelham Monthly
                        <lb/>Meeting</orgName> in Upper Canada, to be composed of Friends <lb/>of
                    Pelham and Black Creek and to be held alternately <lb/>at each place the first
                    Fourth day in every month.</p>

                <p> Attended the opening of the new monthly <lb/>meeting, it being a favored
                    opportunity, which re-<lb/>vived a hope that if this small number of Friends
                    <lb/>composing said meeting keep in humility and <lb/>steady attention to the
                    best direction, their number and <lb/>experience may so increase that the
                    testimony of <lb/>truth may be supported amongst them. After meet-<lb/>ing took
                    leave of our kind friends near the meeting-<lb/>house and rode five miles to our
                    friend, <persName key="sbeck1">Samuel <lb/>Becket</persName>'s, who is a member
                    of said meeting and who <lb/>kindly entertained six of us, <persName

                    view a great curiosity called <lb/>the whirlpool. On our way we met with an
                    acceptable <lb/>repast on excellent peaches. We came to the bank of <lb/> the
                    river, which I believe is three hundred feet above <lb/>the water, nearly
                    perpendicular, on which we had <lb/>a fair view of that astonishing place, the
                    river rush-<lb/>ing with great impetuosity against the bank or wall <lb/>of
                    rocks at a short turn in the river and then turning <lb/>in a cove of perhaps
                    ten acres in which it whirls <lb/>round and round, striving to escape at a
                    narrow pas-<lb/>sage of perhaps one hundred yards, being all the <lb/>opening
                    there is between the high hills. Into this <lb/>pool abundance of logs and
                    timber is carried and per-<lb/>haps cannot get out for some weeks. It is amazing
                    <lb/>to behold the whirls that are formed, the logs sucked <lb/>down and some
                    time after shooting up (perhaps 100 <lb/> yards from the place they went down,
                    end foremost) <lb/>fifteen or twenty feet perpendicular out of the water;
                    <lb/>that upon the whole it is an indescribably agitated <lb/>place. Returned

                    <lb/>and myself in order to take a satisfactory view of the <lb/>great cataract.
                    We went about three-quarters of a <lb/>mile below <geogName key="niagf">the
                        Falls</geogName> and then descended a bank of <lb/>lime-stone rocks, I
                    suppose nearly 300 feet, which <lb/>was not quite perpendicular, to the surface
                    of the <lb/>water, some times holding by roots, some times by <lb/> twigs, and
                    some of the way down a ladder, other <lb/>times sticking our toes in the
                    cavities and holding <lb/>by the craggy parts of the rocks. When down,
                    clam-<lb/>bered along the rocks, logs, slabs, and timber up the <lb/>river to
                    the place where the water shoots over the <lb/>rock and falls 160 feet. We went
                    as far as we though <lb/>was safe, being as wet, with the spray of water and
                    <lb/>sweat, as if we had been in a heavy shower. I had <lb/> an inclination to
                    go further in behind the water, but <lb/><persName key="wlund1"
                        >Lunday</persName> said it was dangerous; for, as he said, if the <lb/>wind
                    were to shift against us we should be in danger <lb/>of being suffocated with
                    the spray and sulphur which <lb/>smelled very strong. I though there was not
                    quite <lb/>so much danger as he alleged, believining he was a <lb/>good deal
                    timid; however, I thought best to decline, <lb/>lest I should suffer for my
                    temerity. On clambering <lb/>along the rocks by the water with a wall or
                    mountain <lb/> of rocks 160 feet high in some place over my head, <lb/>hanging
                    twelve or fifteen feet over plumb, it appeared <lb/>truly awful and dangerous,
                    which put me upon think-<lb/>ing what my view was in going into such apparent
                    <lb/> danger, as it is evident great columns of them fre-<lb/>quently break off
                    and fall down; but as I believed it <lb/>was not altogether to gratify an indle
                    curiosity, for the <lb/>whole of the prospect led me into a reverent frame of
                    <lb/>mind, admiring the wonderful works, and in some <lb/>measure adoring the
                    Great Author, I then though if <lb/>I should then be buried in oblivion, perhaps
                    my soul <lb/>was as much in a state of aspiration and adoration as <lb/> it
                    might be when the unavoidable event should take <lb/>place. This consideration
                    led me on without much <lb/>fear at that time, though naturally timid. I need
                    <lb/>not undertake to describe this wonderful phenom-<lb/>enon, as many pens
                    have been employed in setting <lb/>forth its magnitude; but as I have taken a
                    view of <lb/>the river in places many miles down, I am fully of <lb/>the min
                    dthat the <geogName key="niagf">great Falls</geogName> at some period were nine
                    <lb/> miles farther down the river and that they are gradu-<lb/>ally wearing up,
                    and perhaps in time may drain the <lb/>great <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogName>. It is wonderful to behold the agi-<lb/>tation of the water
                    in the rapids above the falls and <lb/>also below them, column after column
                    dashing <lb/>against each other and rising a great height with <lb/>such foaming
                    and confusion that the whole appears <lb/>truly awful. We were very wet when we
                    left the <lb/> place; got on our horses and rode to <placeName key="chipp1"
                        >Chippewa</placeName>. Fed <lb/>our horses and took a snatch ourselves, then
                    rode to <lb/><placeName key="blacc">Black Creek settlement</placeName>,
                    twenty-four miles, and <lb/>lodged at <persName key="amorr1">Anna

                    <lb/>considering their circumstances,--being most of them <lb/>new settlers and
                    not in very affluent life,--we made <lb/>them an offer of thirty dollars toward
                    purchasing <lb/>materials; but they modestly declined accepting it, <lb/>and
                    said they could do themselves. I have now pre-<lb/>pared things in order to set

                    wet <lb/>night and dull morning. Rode eighteen and one-half <lb/>miles to where
                    there is a large new house building for <lb/>a house of entertainment. Fed our
                    horses and dined <lb/> on our own provisions. The land the most of this stage
                    <lb/>an open plain full of lime-stone which doth not appear <lb/>to me to be
                    very valuable, the grass and herbage of <lb/>an inferior kind; some of the way
                    pretty good land <lb/>covered with beech and sugar maple. From thence <lb/>to
                        <geogName key="tonne">Tonawanda</geogName>, a large stream running into

                    bass, <lb/>black walnut, shell-bark, hickory, poplar, and divers <lb/>other
                    sorts of timber. Just after we crossed the <lb/>

                    herbage. On our way this day we met many <lb/>people moving from <placeName
                        key="bucks">Bucks county</placeName> and <placeName key="jerse">the
                        Jerseys</placeName> to <lb/><placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>. It is

                    our tent there are several <lb/>other fires, at some of which are several
                    Indians <lb/>out hunting. They have large bundles of skins. This <lb/>day's
                    ride, forty-one miles.</p>

                <p> Set off early and rode to <persName key="jelic1">Elicot</persName>'s
                    store-house, <lb/>thirteen miles, having an order from him to get any-<lb/>thing
                    ourselves or horses stood in need of. This stage <lb/>almost all the way
                    excellent limestone land covered <lb/>with ash, beech, bass, sugar maple, etc.,
                    in abun-<lb/>dance; a deep soil and not so broken with the rock <lb/>nor yet so
                    dead a level as in some places, and is tol-<lb/>erably well watered with lively
                    streams. Soon after <lb/>I set off this morning, my mind became serene,
                    <lb/>which led me into an humble state, and thankful-<lb/>ness and gratitude to
                    Him who hath hitherto pre-<lb/>served me and showered down many blessings and
                    <lb/>favors upon me, ascended from my soul, accompanied <lb/>with strong desires
                    that the rest of my time may be <lb/>spent in a measure worthy of such favors.
                    From <lb/>thence to two new taverns just by a large spring; <lb/>seven miles of
                    this distance the land much as before, <lb/> when we came to a creek running to
                    the left called <lb/><geogName key="kitcr">Kittle Creek</geogName>, just at a
                    great fall over a large flat rock, <lb/>called the <geogName key="buttf"
                        >Buttermilk Falls</geogName>, then immediately en-<lb/>tered land of an
                    inferior quality, into a large road I <lb/>suppose opened by the State of New
                    York, on which <lb/>there are many new improvements. From thence <lb/>to
                        <persName key="pars1">Parsons</persName>'s on said road, being a new tavern;
                    pretty <lb/>good accomodations; eleven miles. On the way we <lb/>crossed the
                        <geogName key="genes2">Genesee river</geogName>, four miles form our
                    lodging, <lb/>it being a large stream running into the lake. On <lb/>the west
                    siade of said river there is a small Indian <lb/>village on an extense of flat
                    or plain of very rich land <lb/>covered with high grass, I suppose some
                    thousands of <lb/>acres. This day's ride, thirty-six miles, in which space
                    <lb/>we met fifteen or sixteen wagons with families and <lb/>many other people
                    moving to Upper Canada. So great <lb/>is the emigration to that government.</p>

                <p> Rode ten miles along the aforesaid road <lb/>which is at least 100 feet wide. I
                    was very much <lb/>surprised to see the improvement which is made in <lb/> this
                    new settled country, particularly along this road. <lb/>I am informed it is but
                    ten years since it first began <lb/>to be settled; and now there is not half a
                    mile with-<lb/>out a house, and many of them very good ones--what <lb/>may be
                    called elegant--many capital barns; a great <lb/>deal of land is cleared and
                    there are very good cattle <lb/>in the fields. The people principally emigrated
                    from <lb/> the New England states, and this is a specimen of <lb/>their
                    industry. When we had ridden ten miles from <lb/>our lodging we parted,

                    order to pay a visit to <lb/>some Friends who are settled at a place called
                        <geogName key="mudcr">Mud <lb/> Creek</geogName>. The other friends all
                    propose to go directly <lb/>home. We then rode eight miles to <persName

                    here we propose to <lb/>lodge. The most of the way from the great road
                    <lb/>here, appears to be a light, sandy land, thinly tim-<lb/>bered and I think
                    may be called poor. About one <lb/>mile before we came to <persName key="jsmit1"
                        >Smith</persName>'s, we again came into <lb/>rich beech and sugar maple
                    land. Our landlord doth <lb/>not appear to be much polished, but I believe is
                    <lb/>hearty in entertaining us in his way.</p>

                <p> On viewing the <persName key="alaph1">Lapham</persName>'s <lb/>farm and things
                    about it, (though he lives in a very <lb/>poor house) I was astonished to see
                    the improve-<lb/>ment made in the time; he told me it was but four <lb/>years
                    last spring since he began on it in the woods, <lb/>and now he has more than one
                    hundred acres of land <lb/>fenced in, fields and meadows all in, either with
                    grain <lb/>or grass, and the most of it excellent. Has built a <lb/>saw-mill and
                    has a dairy of cows so good that not-<lb/>withstanding it hath been an
                    unfavorable season, <lb/>they have made above two thousand lbs. of cheese;
                    <lb/>and yet he appears with his precious wife to be well <lb/>concerned
                    Friends, and is free to devote much of his <lb/>time in the service of truth.
                    Truly in this far back <lb/>settlement in the <placeName key="genec">Genesee
                        county</placeName>, State of New York, <lb/>the appearance of things is
                    comfortable, and affords <lb/>an encouraging hope that if the few Friends here
                    set-<lb/>tled improve as well and hold up so good a light in a <lb/>religious
                    sense as they do in improving the wilder-<lb/>ness country, they may yet become
                    as "a city set <lb/>upon a hill that cannot be hid." Stayed all this day
                    <lb/>with these our valued and kind friends; wrote a let-<lb/>ter to <persName

                <p> Rode two miles to <lb/><persName key="ncoms1">Nathan Comstock</persName>'s,

                    and near the close I could not feel easy <lb/>without requesting an opportunity
                    with Friends, se-<lb/>lected from others, which was readily compiled with, <lb/>
                    wherein I endeavored to relieve myself of a heavy <lb/>burden which I had
                    silently borned ever since I came <lb/>into these parts, on account of such a
                    rapid increase <lb/>of the abominable practice of distilling the precious <lb/>
                    wheat into whiskey; and though I believe there are <lb/>a few well concerned
                    Friends here, yet doubts ac-<lb/>companied my mind that they were too easy about
                    <lb/>the wickedness of such a perversion of the blessings <lb/>of Divine
                    Providence; and I endeavored to put them <lb/>upon nobly bearing a testimony
                    against it, and set <lb/>the light upon the candlestick, believing that the
                    des-<lb/>truction or salvation of their country very much de-<lb/>pended upon
                    the conduct pursued in that respect. <lb/>After dinner rode seven miles to
                        <persName key="nherr1">Nathan Herring-<lb/> ton</persName>'s, a kind man not

                <p> Rode five miles through rich land and new <lb/>road. We came to a great road,
                    and as soon as we <lb/>entered it we came in sight of <placeName key="canan"
                        >Canandaigua</placeName>, a newly <lb/>settled town containing nearly or
                    quite fifty houses. <lb/>I was surprised to see such a place in this back
                    <lb/>country. It stands on a beautifully elevated spot, <lb/>the buildings
                    generally excellent, and divers of them <lb/>would cut a very good figure on the
                    banks of the <lb/>
                    <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> for a country seat. The town
                    commands <lb/>a pleasant prospect of a small lake about twenty <lb/>miles long
                    and two or three wide. We rode round <lb/>the lower end of the lake and crossed
                    the outlet; <lb/>then rode nine miles to one <persName key="egilb2"
                        >Gilbert</persName>'s tavern, a good <lb/>stage for horses. Greater part of
                    said nine miles is <lb/> very rich land, some of the timber more mixed with
                    <lb/>hickory and oak than some other places; but gen-<lb/>erally through this
                    country there is a great scarcity <lb/> of mill seats or lively streams. Then to
                        <persName key="tlee1">Thomas <lb/>Lee</persName>'s, a kind man, his wife a
                    member of our society; <lb/>seventeen miles. About midway of this stage we <lb/>
                    passed <persName key="jpott1">Judge Potter</persName>'s house and farm. The
                    house is <lb/>quite grand and magnificent, and was it one story <lb/>higher
                    would cut no inconsiderable fiture in one of <lb/> the most populous streets of

                    we came to said <persName key="tlee1">Lee</persName>'s, we crossed a <lb/>fine

                    <lb/> as there appeared to be a few Friends and some <lb/>Friendly people in

                    answer for a <lb/> dam and head race for one grist mill, two saw mills, <lb/>and

                        <persName key="jcoop1">James Cooper</persName> followed the others <lb/>with

                    of this day's ride was <lb/>chequered with good, bad, and middling land. About
                    <lb/>seven or eight miles before we came to <placeName key="bath"
                        >Bath</placeName> we <lb/>passed the upper end of <geogName key="crook"
                        >Crooked Lake</geogName>, it being about <lb/>twenty miles long and about
                    three miles broad in the <lb/>widest place. About two miles above the head of
                    <lb/>the lake, tolerably good land with improvements; <lb/>the rest of the way
                    to the town very poor land cov-<lb/>ered with pitch pine. The town of <placeName
                        key="bath">Bath</placeName> is hand-<lb/>somely situated on the bank of a

                        <geogName key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogName>, containing about forty

                    <lb/>worse. The most of this stage was very poor, rough land. <lb/> Thence to

                        >Lind-<lb/>sley's</placeName>; a good stage, twelve miles. Immediately after

                    ten times. <lb/>Thence to the block-house, ten miles, where we fed <lb/>and
                    parleyed a little about staying all night. Some <lb/>were for lodgeing there,
                    but from the general account <lb/>of the mischief done to travelers by the man
                    of the <lb/>house or some of his family, I was all along uneasy <lb/>to stay
                    there. The rest of my companions appearing <lb/>disposed to stay, it being then
                    three o'clock in the <lb/>afternoon, however at last I gave up to stay, and then
                    <lb/>they changed their purpose and set off, and I with <lb/> them, I feeling a
                    good deal unhappy at our entering <lb/>a lonesome desert, not knowing whether we
                    should <lb/>meet with any suitable place to encamp, and two of <lb/>our company
                    being infirm. But on riding about <lb/>
                    <pb n="532" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_18"/> three miles, we came to a stream of water
                    and there <lb/>fixed things in order for lodging in the woods, which <lb/>we got
                    completed before night; and had a comfort-<lb/>able night under a tent made of
                    bushes, by a large <lb/>fire. My companions said the place should be called
                        <lb/><placeName key="coatc">Coats's Camp</placeName>, which name I have no
                    doubt it will go <lb/>by. From <placeName key="petec">Peter's Camp</placeName>
                    we immediately left the <geogName key="tioga">Tioga</geogName>
                    <lb/>on our left hand, and ascended a great mountain <lb/>called the <geogName

                    range with the <geogName key="allmo">Alleghany</geogName> and <geogName
                        key="laure">Laurel Hill</geogName>. It <lb/>is a great height and breadth,

                    <lb/>very poor until we came to the said <persName key="wharr1"

                    plantation for <lb/>fertility with a beautiful descent from the house fac-<lb/>
                    ing the south. On taking a view of said farm and <lb/>the buildings upon it, I
                    was led to contemplate upon <lb/>the great difference between the New England
                    set-<lb/>tlers in a new country and those from Maryland, <lb/>having heretofore

                    emigat-<lb/>ted from Maryland and appears in the house hold to <lb/> be in
                    affluent circumstances. Several sons, young <lb/>men grown, and have been
                    settled here, I suppose, <lb/>twelve or fourteen years; have got a good deal of
                    <lb/>excellent land, cleared perhaps by the blacks, but <lb/>they have no barn
                    nor stable fit to put a horse into; <lb/>but have ten or twelve hounds, a tame
                    wolf, etc., and <lb/>I expect spend much of their time in hunting; all of
                    <lb/>which had a tendency to increase my partiality in <lb/> favor of the
                    Yankees. But we are kindly enter-<lb/>tained here; therefore it will not be
                    proper to cast<lb/>any reflections on their economy.</p>

                <p> BEING several years one of the committee who have <lb/>the care of the concern
                    and fund raised by our Yearly <lb/>Meeting for promoting the gradual
                    civilization and <lb/>real benefit of the Indian natives, I have for several
                    <lb/>months past felt my mind drawn to visit them again <lb/>in <placeName

                    last month in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>
                    <lb/>when met, believed it would be likely to be useful in <lb/> promoting that
                    good work, for four Friends to be ap-<lb/>pointed to visit the before-mentioned
                    settlement this <lb/>season; accordingly separated <persName key="ibons1">Isaac

                    <lb/>ten o'clock, and attended Friends' meeting in this <lb/>place, having

                    nearly correspond with the former notes I made <lb/>thereon; but have observed a

                    this part of the country the springs <lb/>and streams of water to be almost
                    wholly dried up <lb/>and gone, even many heretofore large streams with <lb/>no
                    water in them, and many valuable milles are with-<lb/>out one drop, insomuch
                    that divers of the inhabitants <lb/>have got to boiling their wheat to eat and
                    expect if <lb/>the drough continues much longer it will be gener-<lb/>ally the

                    <pb n="547" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_20"/> a very rough mountain called the

                    but I think four-fifths of it is not <lb/>worth settling upon. Just before we
                    came to the <lb/>creek we entered a forest of very tall white pine <lb/>which
                    stands very close together, insomuch that I con-<lb/>cluded if it was all cut up
                    in four-foot lengths it could <lb/> not be corded on the ground. Said <persName

                    which appears to <lb/>be very fertile, having very luxuriant potatoes and
                    <lb/>butterweeds, also the appearance of good oats standing <lb/>in shock and

                    <lb/>mill, on a branch of <geogName key="pinec">Pine Creek</geogName>, thirteen

                    rode about five miles <lb/>through very rich land exceeding heavy loaded with
                    <lb/>timber--mostly white pine with some hemlock, sugar <lb/>maple, etc., and
                    then entered a valley down which a <lb/>branch of <geogName key="pinec">Pine

                    upon a larger branch of said <lb/>water, crossing it several times. Up to the
                    mill pretty <lb/>good land in a narrow valley between two high <lb/>mountains;
                    no house nor improvement for ten miles <lb/>of the last stage. At this place we

                    when he came there <lb/>first, being no road, he came by direction of a
                    <lb/>compass, and resided twelve weeks without see-<lb/>ing the face of any
                    person. Had only a blanket <lb/>and piece of hemlock bark for his house and

                    considerable opening in the heavy timber and has <lb/>got good corn and other
                    things; but truly those who <lb/>have not been in the back country can have but
                    a <lb/>very imperfect idea of the hardship and difficulty <lb/>those have to
                    endure or encounter who are the first <lb/>settlers in a new country. Thence to

                        <persName key="mwils1">Moses Wilson</persName>'s. On our way we came to a
                    camp <lb/> in the woods, where we foudn <persName key="welli1">Wm.
                        Ellis</persName> with a <lb/>Fisher &amp; Co.'s land, said <persName
                        key="welli1">Ellis</persName> accompanying us <lb/>six miles to said
                        <persName key="jmill1">Mills</persName>'s in order to spend the <lb/>
                    evening with us in friendly converse. The land gen-<lb/>erally good this stage,
                    and some of it excellent with<lb/>abundance of very large sugar maple. Said
                        <persName key="jmill1">Mills</persName> is <lb/> living on said Fisher's
                    land which I think will, in time, <lb/>be a very valuable estate. He said he had
                    two years <lb/>ago six hundred dozen of wheat, and the present <lb/>year has got
                    seventeen acres of corn, which will no <lb/>doubt yield fifty or sixty bushels
                    to the acre; appears <lb/>to be a very active, intelligent man; has got twelve
                    <lb/>children, nine of whom live with him, who are <lb/>very healthy and hardy.
                    He is perhaps as successful <lb/> a hunter as there is in this State, and many
                    of the <lb/>wild beasts of the woods fall a prety to his skill, such <lb/>as
                    bears, panthers, elk, and deer. It is said and be-<lb/>lieved he killed eleven
                    elk one morning before break-<lb/>fast. One of his sons, in the ninth year of
                    his age, <lb/>killed six elk and five deer; is now in the fourteenth <lb/>year
                    of his age, has killed several bears this season. <lb/>Two of his daughters
                    killed three elk in one day; <lb/> and we have this evening feasted on the
                    product of <lb/>their skill. Said <persName key="jmill1">Mills</persName> told
                    me that he and one other <lb/>man were out about a week and they killed in that
                    <lb/>time above seventy deer.</p>

                    thirty-eight times before we came to the <lb/>head, which is about eighty miles
                    from where it <lb/>empties into the <geogName key="westb">West
                    Branch</geogName>. Almost all the way <lb/>up it, good land in general, heavy
                    loaded with timber, <lb/>some of the way very lofty white pine. After we left
                    <lb/>the head of said creek, rode seven miles through <lb/>very rich land and
                    timber rather exceeding that on <lb/><geogName key="pinec">Pine
                    Creek</geogName>, to a spring, being one of the head-springs <lb/>of the

                <p> Rode twenty-three miles to a new settlement <lb/>on <geogName key="osweo"
                        >Osweo</geogName> being one of the main branches of the <lb/>aforesaid

                    <lb/>or Francis King's settlement. The most of the said <lb/>twenty-three miles
                    is excellent land, but so heavy <lb/>loaded with timber of divers sorts, such as
                    hemlock, <lb/>white pine, sugar maple, cherry, and some bass or <lb/>lynn, that
                    it will be very expensive clearing. It is <lb/>astonishing to see the height of
                    the white pine, and <lb/>other timber in proportion. Although to such as
                    <lb/>have never seen such timber it may seem a little <lb/>romantic, I have
                    seen, (particularly when we came <lb/>near <placeName key="ceres">Francis

                    to be in good <lb/>spirits, were truly glad to see us, his wife remarkably
                    <lb/>so, insomuch that she was ready to weep with joy; <lb/>is a remarkably
                    cleanly woman and was very happy <lb/>this afternoon in entertaining us with a
                    good cup of <lb/>tea sweetened with loaf sugar and good will, that I <lb/>though
                    the joy and happiness we were instrumental <lb/>in communicating to this woman
                    was almost worth <lb/>our journey to these parts. Here we also met with <lb/> my
                    old friend, <persName key="halft1">Halftown</persName>, who is up here in a
                    canoe <lb/>with three of his children, in order to get some <lb/>necessary
                    tools, etc.; was just going to set off about <lb/>fifty miles down the river to
                    his home. He was very <lb/>much rejoiced to see us and agreed to stay until

                    died after he came here, leaving with him <lb/>seven or eight children who are

                    pay the tribute <lb/>of worship. We sat with them in their little meet-<lb/>ing

                    received us very kindly in <lb/>his cabin and treated us with the best provision

                    in company all the way with the vessel <lb/>which our friends were on board of,
                    and another <lb/> canoe with one man in it going to <placeName key="pitts"
                        >Pittsburg</placeName>. We <lb/>sometimes sat up and sometimes lay down and
                    slept <lb/>between two Indians navigating us, who appeared <lb/>very dexterous,
                    and disposed to accommodate us in <lb/> every respect in their power. About
                    twelve or fifteen <lb/>miles down from the <geogName key="issua"
                        >Issua</geogName> we stopped and dined at a<lb/>place called the <placeName
                        key="plumo">Plum-Orchard</placeName>, it being on or near <lb/>the upper end
                    of the Indian reserve. I never saw <lb/> such a place before, it containing
                    about forty or fifty <lb/>acres of exceeding rich land thickly set with trees
                    <lb/>which are loaded with excellent fruit, and abundance <lb/>on the ground,
                    now in full season. I have no doubt <lb/>but there is more than one hundred
                    cart-loads of ex-<lb/>cellent plums on which we satiated our appetites for <lb/>
                    that fruit and took some on board. Then sailed down <lb/>the river to the mouth
                    of the <geogName key="tusqu">Tusquiatossy</geogName>, it being twen-<lb/>ty-one
                    miles from <geogName key="issua">Issua</geogName>. There we struck up a fire,
                    <lb/>pitched our tents and slept on the river-bank, the <lb/>number of the

                        >Genesinguhta</placeName>, <lb/>where we met with our beloved friends,

                    time, improving some <lb/>of them in the smith- business. It was truly a very
                    <lb/>satisfactory meeting, particularly to them, they being <lb/>so long from a
                    sense of duty separated from their <lb/>friends and relatives. Many of the
                    Indians came to <lb/>see us this afternoon and took us by the hand with
                    <lb/>evident tokens of great joy, which is a clear indica-<lb/> tion that they
                    are highly pleased with, and in good <lb/>measure sensible of our disinterested
                    endeavor to <lb/>improve them in agriculture, mechanical arts, and
                    <lb/>profitable civilization. We observed, as we sailed <lb/>down, the Indian
                    reserve of land along the river to <lb/>be excellent; and when we came within
                    fourteen or <lb/>fifteen miles of <placeName key="genes1"
                        >Genesinguhta</placeName>, the settlements and<lb/>
                    <pb n="563" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_23"/> improvements began to appears, and many
                    of the In-<lb/>dians have begun to clear out and cultivate their <lb/>ground;
                    have built houses more comfortable than<lb/>they were formerly accustomed to.
                    When I was up <lb/>the river from this place four years ago, I believe
                    <lb/>there were but three or four settlements worth <lb/>noticing; and now there
                    are eighteen or nineteen, <lb/>and divers of them have large fields of corn,
                    con-<lb/>siderable stock of cattle, and some of them this sea-<lb/>son had wheat
                    for sale; so that upon the whole I <lb/> think they have improved in agriculture
                    beyond my <lb/>expectations. Soon after we arrived, our friends <lb/>showed us
                    the copy of a speech made by <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>

                            you think will be useful; then such of our <lb/>people as are able will
                            buy for themselves, and such <lb/>as are poor we wish you to continue to
                            lend to, and <lb/>they shall be returned to you again. We also want
                            <lb/>you to bring useful cloths and sell to us, that we may <lb/>get
                            some necessary things without having to go so far <lb/>for them. In
                            looking forward we can limit no time <lb/>for you to live beside us;
                            this must depend on your <lb/>own judgment. When your friends come from

                            communicate this speech to <lb/>them as the full result of our minds

                        <p> Friends, Tewenstee, attend. I will add a little <lb/>further. When I was
                            in <placeName key="phila">Phildelphia</placeName>, a long time <lb/>ago,
                            the Indians and white people at that time con-<lb/>tinued to kill each
                            other; I then heard of Quakers, <lb/> that they were a peaceable people,
                            and would not <lb/>fight or kill anybody. I inquired of the President
                            <lb/>of the United States about them, whether or not this <lb/>account
                            was true. He said it was true enough; they <lb/> were such a people. I
                            then requested him to send <lb/>some of them to live amonst the Indians,
                            expecting <lb/>they would be very useful to us. Then it was a long
                            <lb/>time after before you came. You are now here, and <lb/> it has
                            afforded me much satisfaction that you have <lb/>come. I have not been
                            disappointed in the account <lb/>I heard of you. You have lived
                            peacefully among us, <lb/>and no difficulty has happened between you and
                            our <lb/>people. We now want you to stay with us and stand <lb/>between
                            us and the white people; and if you see any <lb/>of them trying to cheat
                            us let us know of it; or if you <lb/>see any of our people trying to
                            cheat the white we <lb/>wish you to let it be known also, as we confide
                            in you<lb/>that you will not cheat us.</p>
                        <p> "Friends, we have now spoken so full on the busi-<lb/>ness that we need
                            not say any more until we find one <lb/>of you has killed one of our
                            people, and we find him <lb/>lying dead on the ground, or until one of
                            us kills one <lb/>of you; then we will take up the business again."

                <p> Notwishstanding this, we thought it necessary to <lb/>see the chiefs and others
                    in council; and being in-<lb/>formed that <persName key="cornp2"
                        >Cornplanter</persName> was just set out on a hunt-<lb/>ing tour, we hired
                    an Indian to go in the night, (though <lb/>it was a wet one), in quest of him.
                    He set out and <lb/> traversed the woods, blowing his horn; and just at
                    <lb/>daybreak found him, who came to us early this morn-<lb/>ing which is the
                        <date when="1803-09-21">21st</date>, and 4th of the week. After
                    <lb/>conferring with him, he appeared very much pleased <lb/>with our coming,
                    and agreed to send out for the dis-<lb/>tant chiefs and others to meet us in
                    council at this <lb/>place next Seventh- day morning. We then set off up<lb/>the
                    river in order to look for a suitable place to maek <lb/>a settlement and build
                    a saw-mill. Having viewed <lb/>two valleys heretofore had in view, but found the
                    <lb/> streams entirely dried up, we came to a fine stream <lb/>on the east side
                    of the river, called <geogName key="tunes">Tunesasau</geogName>, on <lb/>which
                    we think there is a good mill-seat, being about <lb/>three and a half miles from
                    this place, and land tol-<lb/>erably good; then returned. On our way we had the
                    <lb/>curiosity to ascend a very high mountain in order to <lb/>have a prospect
                    of the river and adjacent country. <lb/><persName key="jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor</persName> and myself pursued our <lb/>route until we got a grand
                    prospect of the river and <lb/>the adjacent country and a number of the Indian
                    set-<lb/>tlements, and got home as soon as the others. The <lb/>young Indian who
                    is the smith at <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>,<lb/>whose name
                    is <persName key="lhalf1">Levi Halftown</persName>, went with us and re-<lb/>
                    <pb n="564" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_24"/> turned with those who gave out; he made
                    himself <lb/>very merry with us when walking through the woods; <lb/>said the
                    Quakers were like little children learning to <lb/>walk, and that we might now
                    see some of the hard-<lb/>ships the Indians had to pass through in their
                    hunt-<lb/>ing, only that it would not dor for them to stop and <lb/>rest; but
                    when he found I went on, said there was <lb/>one hardy man amongst them. I think
                    I never heard <lb/>
                    <persName key="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName> complain or give out until
                    this <lb/>time. In the evening <persName key="eblue1">Blue Eyes</persName> came;
                    was very <lb/>glad to see us, but was sorry he had to go to <placeName
                        key="catta1">Catta-<lb/>raugus</placeName> to see a sick daughter, so that
                    he could not be <lb/>at the council. Because he is a steady friend and pro-<lb/>
                    moter of our concern for the good of the natives, be-<lb/>ng a chief who both by
                    precept and example endeav-<lb/>ors to lead them on in habits of sobriety and
                    indus-<lb/>try, and as he could not stay with us, we took the op-<lb/>ortunity
                    of opening to him some of the reasons of <lb/>our coming here at this time,
                    which was a proposal <lb/>of our young men's moving off their land and
                    set-<lb/>tling near them on some of their own. He was wise <lb/>enough to see
                    the reason of the proposal; and al-<lb/>though he saw and gave in to the
                    propriety of it, yet <lb/>appeared sorry, and he is a near neighbor; and said if
                    <lb/>they moved he would wait to see how they would do <lb/>and then move near
                    them. Truly the opportunity <lb/>this evening with <persName key="eblue1">Blue
                        Eyes</persName> had a tendency to pro-<lb/>duce some very pleasant
                    sensations in my mind, and <lb/>I thought I could own him for, and really felt
                    him <lb/>near, as a brother.</p>

                <p> Fifth of the week. This being the day on <lb/>which the young men hold their
                    meeting, we sat with <lb/>them, which I believe was a time of refreshment to
                    <lb/>us all. In the afternoon walked about viewing the <lb/> improvements the
                    Indians ahve made which are con-<lb/>siderable. Several of them have a good deal
                    of corn, <lb/>and some have raised some wheat; but I think they <lb/>have not
                    improved in agriculture and industry equal <lb/>to those up the river. We saw
                    two of them threshing<lb/>their wheat; but as they had not barn to put it in, it
                    <lb/>appeared to be somewhat damaged in the stack. I <lb/>endeavored to put them
                    upon building barns, which <lb/>they promised to do.</p>

                <p> We all in company with <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName>, <persName
                        key="jpenn1">John <lb/>Pennock</persName> and <persName key="jswai1">Joel

                        >Genesing-<lb/>uhta</placeName>, or Cornplanter's Village, nine and a half
                    miles. <lb/>Being eight of us having three horses, <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor</persName>
                    <lb/>and myself walked all the way and back again, being <lb/> nineteen miles.
                    The others rode turn about. We ar-<lb/>rived at the village about eleven o'clock
                    and spent <lb/>two or three hours in viewing the Indians' houses,
                    <lb/>corn-fields, and other improvements; and although <lb/> we discovered
                    fourteen shingled houses and abund-<lb/>ance of corn, yet I think they have not
                    improved <lb/>four years past, equal to the Indians up the river. We <lb/>dined
                    at <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>'s upon the best venison I have
                    <lb/>eaten since I left home, Indian bread, butter, butter-<lb/>milk, bears' fat
                    and squashes. Some of our company <lb/>were very desirous to return before
                    dinner; but <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob <lb/>Taylor</persName> told them it
                    would not do. They then sum-<lb/>moned all the fortitude they could and sat down
                    to <lb/>dinner. <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName>, <persName
                        key="jpenn1">John Pennock</persName>, <persName key="jswai1">Joel

                    and myself at with good-will; <lb/>the others did as well as they could. The old
                    chief <lb/>was very pleasant with us and made himself very <lb/>cheerful,
                    inquiring for <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName>; said he was <lb/>
                    a man for his mind, and if he had not been a Quaker <lb/>he would have made a
                    very good war chief. Some <lb/>time after dinner, we returned. <persName
                        key="jtayl1">J. Taylor</persName>, <persName key="tstew1">Thomas
                        <lb/>Stewardson</persName>, <persName key="ibons1">Isaac Bonsal</persName>,
                        <persName key="gvaux1">George Vaux</persName> and myself <lb/>walked one or
                    two miles near the river bank; the <lb/>other three rode. On our way passed
                    through abun-<lb/>dance of good corn and beans, and by eight or ten <lb/>
                    houses, some of them very complete work, with stone <lb/>chimneys. In one of
                    them lives an old woman, half-<lb/>sister of <persName key="cornp2"
                        >Cornplanter</persName>, with three or four sons. The <lb/>poor old woman
                    was rejoiced to see us; said she was <lb/>thankful to the Good Spirit for
                    preserving us in our <lb/>long journey to see them, and also that He put it in
                    <lb/>our hearts to have compassion on them; and that she<lb/>was old and did not
                    expect to be at the council to-<lb/>morrow, but hoped the Good Spirit would
                    preserve <lb/>us. Truly the manner of her expression, the tears <lb/>standing in
                    her eyes, and the whole of her deport-<lb/>ment, expression, and appearance had
                    a tendency to <lb/>enliven the affectionate feelings of my heart, and I
                    <lb/>could not help thinking she was as much the favorite <lb/> of Him who sees
                    not as man sees, as many who think <lb/>themselves more polished. In about three
                    miles' <lb/>walking, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, <persName
                        key="conud1">Conudiu</persName>, and about twenty or <lb/> thirty more of
                    the Indians overtook us on their way <lb/>up to the council. I walked very
                    pleasantly and cheer-<lb/>fully with them. The old chief, Cornplanter, wanted
                    <lb/>me to ride his horse; but when I refused, he said I <lb/>was a sachem.</p>

                        <p>You have heard the speech which our friends at<lb/>home have sent to you
                            by us. We now wish you to<lb/>speak your minds to us quite plain, and if
                            there is<lb/>anything which does not feel easy to you, that you<lb/>will
                            tell it to us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have seen the speech made by you<lb/>to our friends who live
                            among you, at one of your<lb/>late councils, by which we understand you
                            leave<lb/>them at full liberty to move up the river to settle
                            on<lb/>land joining to yours.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, since we came here we have been<lb/>viewing the land, and think
                            if the <orgName key="hollco">Holland Company</orgName><lb/>will sell us
                            a piece on <geogName key="tunec">Tunesasah Creek</geogName> that it will
                            be<lb/>a suitable place for our friends to settle upon; they<lb/>will
                            then still be among your settlements.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, when our friends first came to settle<lb/>among you, we told
                            you the tools they then brought<lb/>should be for your use, to be lent
                            among such of you<lb/><pb n="578" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_26"/>as wanted to
                            use them. They have been so lent,<lb/>and we have sent others for our
                            friends to use.<lb/> When our friends remove, such of the first parcel
                            of<lb/>tools as remain with them, will be left with your<lb/>chiefs to
                            be lent out for the good of the nation.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have lent some blacksmith tools to<lb/>the smith who resides
                            at the upper town; the others<lb/>our friends take with them; but the
                            smith who lives<lb/>here may have the use of them. The two smiths
                            we<lb/>hope are now able to do nearly all the smith-work<lb/>you will
                            want.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, if our friends get a house put up before<lb/>winter suitable
                            for their accommmodation, they will<lb/>remove from the one they now
                            live in. The barn<lb/>and some of the land they may want another
                            sum-<lb/>mer, as perhaps they cannot get land enough cleared<lb/>to
                            raise grain and hay for their cattle. You will<lb/>agree among
                            yourselves which of you shall live here<lb/>when our friends remove.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, when our friends remove they will<lb/>continue to give you
                            assistance and instruction when<lb/>they can; if they think you stand in
                            need of it.<lb/>Several of you have tools, and as there are some
                            of<lb/>the first parcel which came up that are not worn out,<lb/>they
                            will be left with the chiefs to be lent to such as<lb/>want. Many of
                            these tools are already lent; we<lb/>think it will be best for you to
                            appoint some person<lb/>to have particular charge and care of them, as
                            lend-<lb/>ing tools has been very troublesome.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we understand by your speech to our<lb/>friends that you want
                            them to bring on tools and<lb/>cloth to sell. Brothers, we do not want
                            them to keep<lb/>a store of goods among you; we think it will not
                            be<lb/>best; but we intend to send on a few scythes,
                            sickles,<lb/>augers, and some such tools for our friends to sell
                            to<lb/>such of you as may want to buy; but if any of your<lb/>people buy
                            from them and then sell to the white<lb/>people, they are not to sell
                            any more to such as do so.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we again repeat it, we wish you to<lb/>speak your minds freely
                            to us, and if there is any-<lb/>thing which you and we do not understand
                            alike,<lb/>that you will tell us, as it is our wish to comply
                            with<lb/>all our engagements. The iron which our friends<lb/>have
                            promised you will be sent on as soon as the<lb/>water will admit.</p>
                    </body>
                </floatingText>

                <p>After a little pause, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> replied:
                        <said who="cornp2">"If you<lb/>will leave us a little while, we will counsel
                        among<lb/>ourselves and return you an answer.</said></p>
                <p>We then left them about an hour, when they sent<lb/>us word they were ready. We
                    again seated ourselves<lb/>as before, when Cornplanter addressed us in
                    sub-<lb/>stance as follows:</p>
                <floatingText type="speech">
                    <body>
                        <dateline><date when="1803-09-24"/><placeName key="cornp"/></dateline>
                        <p>We are all glad to see you that are now assem-<lb/>bled in council, and
                            glad to hear what you say to us;<lb/>and your speech is good, being the
                            same language<lb/>you have always spoken to us. We know the time
                            is<lb/>out that was first agreed upon for your young men to<lb/>stay
                            with us, and that nothing had been said to us<lb/>about their staying
                            longer, and perhaps that was the<lb/>reason why they wanted to purchase
                            a piece of land<lb/>from the <orgName>Holland Company</orgName> joining
                            to ours; but they<lb/>were welcome to live where they now do as long
                            as<lb/>they please; and if the <orgName>Holland Company</orgName> will
                            not<lb/>sell you any land, we hope they will continue to live<lb/>where
                            they now do. When your friends first came,<lb/>and for a long time
                            after, many of the white people<lb/>told us to 'watch the Quakers well,
                            for they are a<lb/>cunning, designing people, [and] under pretense
                            of<lb/>doing something for you intend to get some advan-<lb/>tage of you
                            some way or other.' But of late, finding<lb/>all was straight and no
                            advantage attempted to be<lb/>taken, they have left off talking about
                            it. Your<lb/>young men and we have now lived several years
                            as<lb/>brothers. When they came here we were very ig-<lb/>norant, but
                            are now just beginning to learn. Your<lb/>young men do not talk much to
                            us, but when they<lb/>do they speak good words and have been very
                            help-<lb/>ful in keeping us from using whiskey. We had de-<lb/>sired
                            them to agree among themselves who should<lb/>live in this house, as
                            your young men expect to leave<lb/>it before winter; but we do not think
                            it right to fix<lb/>on any one yet, for if you cannot buy a piece of
                            land,<lb/>they will need this place themselves; and if you do<lb/>buy a
                            piece, they may not get a house fit to live in<lb/>before winter, and
                            then they will want it themselves.<lb/>You have said you will leave all
                            the buildings, fences,<lb/>farm, etc., for us to have, except the barn
                            and some<lb/>of the land next summer to raise some grain and<lb/>hay for
                            yourselves and cattle until you can raise it<lb/>on your new settlement;
                            but it is hard work to cut<lb/>down so many big trees and clear the
                            land; perhaps<lb/>they cannot get enough cleared next summer, and
                            if<lb/>they do not, they are welcome to work this as long<lb/>as they
                            need it. So it will be time enough to choose<lb/>one of our people to
                            have this house and farm when<lb/>your young men are well fixed on the
                            new place.<lb/>We will appoint some of our chiefs to receive
                            the<lb/>tools and collect such as are lent out; to have the<lb/>charge
                            of lending them. In our speech to your young<lb/>men we requested them
                            to bring cloth and tools to<lb/>sell to us that we might not be cheated
                            by the white<lb/>people. But you have come to a wise conclusion
                            in<lb/>not keeping a general store amongst us, for perhaps<lb/>some
                            uneasiness or dispute might arise if a store were<lb/>kept. But we thank
                            you for your kind intention of<lb/>bringing some scythes, sickles,
                            augers, etc., to sell to<lb/>such of our people as may want them, and
                            are pleased<lb/>that such who buy are restricted from selling to
                            white<lb/>people; also for the iron which you propose to give<lb/>to us,
                            we wish your young men may divide amongst<lb/>our people, and then we
                            can get the smiths to make<lb/>such things as we want.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are well pleased with your conduct<lb/>toward us and having
                            always done what you prom-<lb/>ised to do.</p>

                <p>An old chief called <persName key="mush1">Mush</persName>said a few words as
                    a<lb/>kind of acknowledgment for some little uneasiness<lb/>he had occasioned
                    principally by his not heretofore<lb/>understanding the nature of our intention
                    or prospect<lb/>of settling our young men amongst them, but now<lb/>appeared
                    perfectly satisfied. Then <persName key="conne1">Connewauteu</persName><lb/>said
                    that we promised to endeavor to send a smith<lb/>among them; that after some
                    time we did send one,<lb/>but he stayed a short time, <said who="conne1">and our
                        smiths were<lb/>not fully perfect in the trade. Now you have sent
                        a<lb/>smith, the best we ever saw; he can make every-<lb/>thing we want, but
                        he has been here but a very little<lb/>time and now says he is going away.
                        We wish he<lb/>
                        <pb n="579" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_27"/>would stay all winter, and then we
                        think our smiths<lb/>by that time, with his instruction, will be able to
                        do<lb/>our work; but now they cannot do all we want.</said></p>
                <p>We replied that <persName key="jpenn1">John Pennock,</persName> (the good
                    smith<lb/>he meant), had a wife and children at home who re-<lb/>quired his
                    attention, and we could not urge him to<lb/>stay from them longer than he was
                    willing; that he<lb/>had been with them as long as we expected; but<lb/>when we
                    got home we would mention their request<lb/>to our friends for them to consider
                    whether they<lb/>could help them or not.</p>
                <p>And as I have heretofore and more stongly of<lb/>late felt my mind impressed with
                    strong desires for<lb/>the benefit and improvement of the poor natives

                    the rest of my brethren present having<lb/>desired me to reply to them, I
                    addressed them in sub-<lb/>stance, as follows:</p>

                        <p>Brethren and friends attend. It is now a great<lb/>many years since our
                            forefathers, the Quakers, came<lb/> over the great water and began to
                            settle in that part<lb/>of this country called <placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsylvania.</placeName> At that time<lb/>the Indians were very
                            numerous and we were but<lb/>very few. The Indians were kind to our
                            forefathers,<lb/>helped and assisted them in the wilderness.
                            Love<lb/>and confidence were kept alive towards our fathers<lb/>and the
                            Indians a great many years, and they were<lb/>at peace with each other;
                            but after some years a great<lb/>many other people came over the great
                            water and a<lb/>great many were born here who were not so
                            peace-<lb/>able and did not love the Indians so much as our<lb/>fathers
                            did, who were the first settlers. And as these<lb/>people became
                            numerous, for a good while [they] had<lb/>a share in the great councils
                            in <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania;</placeName> and at<lb/>length as
                            our fathers, the Quakers, were altogether<lb/>for peace, and the others
                            became the more numerous,<lb/>they took the great councils of the State
                            affairs in<lb/><placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> into
                            their hands; many of these were<lb/>very desirous of having the Indians'
                            lands, and as<lb/>fast as they could kept driving them back. Then
                            In-<lb/>dians began to kill white men and white men to kill<lb/>Indians.
                            All this time the Quakers loved the In-<lb/>dians and did not kill any
                            of them, but were very<lb/>sorry the Indians and white men did kill one
                            another,<lb/>but could not help it; and [during] the long time
                            of<lb/>Indians and white men being at war and killing one<lb/>another,
                            treaties were often appointed, and although<lb/>the Quakers had no power
                            over either the Indians or<lb/>whites, yet some of them almost always
                            attended the<lb/>treaties to try to keep the Indians from being
                            cheated<lb/>out of their land or other things. The wars and<lb/>troubles
                            continued at times between the Indians and<lb/>whites, until about ten
                            years ago when there seemed<lb/>to be a general peace agreed upon
                            between the In-<lb/>dians and white people in this country. Soon
                            after<lb/>that, at one of our great councils in Philadelphia,<lb/>where
                            there were a great many hundred Quakers<lb/>present, we remembered our
                            Indian brothers, whose<lb/>fathers were so kind to our fathers, and on
                            whose<lb/>fathers' lands, (which once belonged to them), we<lb/>now live
                            so comfortably; and our Indian brothers<lb/>being driven back, we
                            counciled amongst ourselves<lb/>to know what way we could do them the
                            most good.<lb/>We then thought if we would raise a great deal
                            of<lb/>money--and give it to them, they would soon waste<lb/>it and
                            spend it for whiskey and in other ways which<lb/>would do them no good
                            at last. Then we concluded<lb/>to ask leave of the President of the
                            United States to<lb/>try to help our Indian brothers. The President
                            ap-<lb/>peared to love the Indians and gave us leave; and as<lb/>we knew
                            that by clearing and cultivating our land we<lb/>had got to live
                            comfortably, we thought it would be<lb/>best to get some of our sober,
                            industrious young men<lb/>to come out and live amongst them and endeavor
                            to<lb/>teach them to clear and farm their land so that they<lb/>might
                            live comfortably as we do on ours. It is now<lb/>several years since
                            some of our young men have been<lb/>living amongst you.</p>
                        <p>Now, brothers, it rejoices our hearts to find that<lb/>the Good Spirit
                            has preserved our young men<lb/>amongst you and that we see signs of
                            industry taking<lb/>place; many of you are beginning to build
                            better<lb/>houses and clear out your land, raise more corn, as<lb/>well
                            as cattle and wheat, particularly up the river.<lb/>Brothers, you may be
                            assured that we do not want<lb/>anything from you for all that we do for
                            you, neither<lb/>your skins, your furs, your land, nor anything
                            else<lb/>that you have; only that you should attend to the<lb/>counsel
                            and instruction of our young men who live<lb/>among you. Brothers, it
                            made our hearts glad when<lb/>we heard from our young men that the
                                <orgName key="seneca">Seneca nation</orgName><lb/>of Indians, more
                            especially on the <geogName key="alleg">Alleghany
                            River</geogName>,<lb/>had taken up the resolution to banish whiskey
                            and<lb/>other strong liquor from amongst you; we wish you<lb/>to be
                            strong in your resolution and join together as<lb/>one man against this
                            mighty evil; and when any of<lb/>your young men are out hunting or
                            otherwise met<lb/>with white people that offer it to them, be sure to
                            re-<lb/>fuse, for when a man drinks some he mostly wants<lb/>more and
                            more until he gets drunk; and when that<lb/>is the case either with
                            white people or Indians, they<lb/>mostly neglect their business; their
                            wives and chil-<lb/>dren often suffer for want of necessary
                            things.<lb/>Brothers, there are other things that do a great
                            many<lb/>white men much harm, which are gaming, playing<lb/>cards and
                            laying wagers; whereby many of them<lb/>not only spend their time
                            unprofitably, but often lose<lb/>almost all that their wives, children,
                            and themselves<lb/>should have to live upon. We wish you not to
                            fall<lb/>into any of these practices, but to live sober,
                            indus-<lb/>trious lives; and then the Good Spirit will love
                            and<lb/>preserve you. But if you will get drunk and be<lb/>wicked, you
                            will feel sorrow and trouble in your own<lb/>hearts for it.</p>

                <p>After which a letter from <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> to
                        <persName key="cornp2">Corn-<lb/>planter</persName> was read, which
                    mentioned this desire,--that<lb/>they might follow the counsel we gave them;
                    that<lb/>they would have the ox instead of the buffalo, the<lb/>hog instead of
                    the bear, and the sheep instead of the<lb/>deer.</p>
                <p><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> then replied it was very true if
                    we<lb/>had given them a large sum of money it would all<lb/>have been gone
                    before now and they would have<lb/>been none the better; and he appeared quite
                    elevated<lb/>with <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish's</persName> prospect of
                    their having domestic<lb/>animals instead of the wild, and said very
                        pleasantly<lb/><pb n="580" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_28"/>that he should soon be
                    an old man leaning on his<lb/>staff and could no more go out to hunt, and if
                    they<lb/>followed our advice he would then never want fresh<lb/>meat--he could
                    have it at the door and not have to<lb/>go to the woods for it. Then the chiefs
                    and divers of<lb/>the young men took us by the hand and with great<lb/>marks of
                    affection concluded the council.</p>

                <p>On meditat-<lb/>ing on the occurrences of the day and what we have<lb/>seen and
                    heard and felt since we came amongst them,<lb/>I felt a secret satisfaction to
                    spring in my heart, ac-<lb/>companied with a belief that the Everlasting
                    Father<lb/>and Care-taker of men owns the concern for the im-<lb/>proving of
                    these inhabitants of the wilderness, and<lb/>that their understandings were more
                    clearly opened<lb/>to see into the nature, utility, and disinterestedness<lb/>of
                    our labor, expense, and concern for their improve-<lb/>ment. Last evening our
                    horses came, we having sent<lb/>three Indians for them last Fourth-day to

                    hence, where we left<lb/>them. We were glad to see them, though they

                        <p>Brothers, we are thankful to the Great Spirit for<lb/>opening the way for
                            us to meet here to-day. Our<lb/>hearts are made glad when we remember
                            the Great<lb/>Spirit has put it into the hearts of our brothers
                            to<lb/>take notice of us; for we are a poor, destitute people,<lb/>our
                            lands being almost all gone, and we hope you will<lb/>excuse, or not
                            think hard of us, when we open our<lb/> helpless situation to you. We
                            have sent for <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob<lb/>Taylor</persName> to give
                            us some advice about our saw-mill, it<lb/>being out of order. Now we are
                            convinced the Good<lb/>Spirit approves of our request, and has a mind to
                            do<lb/>us good, because he has so ordered it that our<lb/>brothers, some
                            of the Quaker chiefs, have come along<lb/>with him.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have been made glad when we<lb/>heard from our brothers, the
                            Quakers, that they were<lb/> willing to take three or four of our boys
                            and instruct<lb/>them in farming and other useful training and
                            occu-<lb/>pations. Brothers, we are very thankful to you for<lb/>your
                            kind offer, and we have been counselling among<lb/>ourselves and trying
                            to get some boys about the age<lb/>of fifteen, that will be of good
                            dispositions and in-<lb/>genious in learning; for we think if we could
                            get<lb/>some of them instructed as you are, they might be<lb/>very
                            useful to our nation, not only in teaching others,<lb/>but in keeping
                            our accounts, so that we may not be<lb/>cheated. Brothers, we find this
                            is a very hard thing<lb/> to come at. We have a good many boys that
                            would<lb/>do, but their relations think so much of them they<lb/> cannot
                            bear to part with them; but here is one, a<lb/>nephew of mine, fifteen
                            years old, who is willing to<lb/> go, and is a fine boy. His father and
                            mother are<lb/>also willing; but his grandfather and his uncle
                            refuse<lb/> to let him go, and say they cannot part with him, so<lb/>we
                            must give him out for the present, for it is of the<lb/> utmost
                            importance to us to maintain harmony in our<lb/>nation. There is one
                            about nine years old that I<lb/> would be glad you would take; he is a
                            fine boy.</p>

                    to be the product of an honest and sincere<lb/>heart; to this effect:</p>

                        <p>Brothers, I hope you will not think hard of us<lb/>when we open our
                            hearts to you, for we are a poor,<lb/> destitute people, and our land is
                            now so nearly all<lb/>sold that we have but a little left for every
                            family;<lb/> and the deer is become very scarce, so that we
                            often<lb/>may hunt all day and have nothing at night. Broth-<lb/> ers,
                            our hearts rejoiced when we heard the Quakers<lb/>were taking pity on
                            us, although we could scarcely<lb/> think there was any people who would
                            do so much<lb/>as you are doing for us, without being paid. But<lb/> now
                            we are convinced that the Quakers have the<lb/>good of our nation at
                            heart, for we see you have sent<lb/> some of your young men to the
                                <geogName key="alleg">Allegheny River</geogName> to<lb/>teach the
                            Indians to farm, without asking any pay<lb/>for it; and we see that many
                            of our people are<lb/>learning. They live much better than formerly,
                            and<lb/>we have seen so much of the conduct of your young<lb/>men that
                            we can rely upon them; and we have found<lb/><persName key="jtayl1"
                                >Jacob Taylor</persName> to be a true man. Brothers, we are<lb/>
                            ashamed to ask what we are now going to ask of you,<lb/> but our
                            necessity makes us willing. We cannot ex-<lb/> pect you to do so much as
                            to send any of your young<lb/>men to live among us; but we think if you
                            would<lb/> send us a set of smith's tools, we have a young man<lb/>that
                            has learned at <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta,</placeName> that
                            can do our<lb/> smith work. Now we have to go above thirty miles<lb/>to
                            get it done and often have to wait near a week be-<lb/>fore we can get
                            it done. And we are determined to<lb/>get to farming, working our land,
                            and to raising wheat<lb/>to support our families. Brothers, you have
                            done a<lb/> great deal for us in sending us saw-mill irons
                            which<lb/>have been of great use to us; but our saw-mill is out<lb/>of
                            order, and that is the reason we sent for <persName key="jtayl1"
                                >Jacob<lb/> Taylor</persName> to show us how to mend it, as he is a
                            man we<lb/>can confide in. But, brothers, do not think hard of<lb/>us if
                            we should ask one thing more, for the Great<lb/>Spirit has blessed you
                            with wise hearts and you are<lb/>become rich; and that is we have but
                            one plow and<lb/>many of us are desirous of becoming farmers and<lb/>sow
                            wheat, but cannot get a plow. If you would send<lb/>us another set of
                            plow-irons, we have two good yoke<lb/>of oxen and a number of horses,
                            then we think we<lb/> could do pretty well. </p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have heard your advice or counsel<lb/>to us in time past to
                            refrain from drinking whiskey.<lb/>We thank you for it, for we see if we
                            do not, we shall<lb/> come to nothing; and, brothers, you sent us a
                            letter<lb/>four years ago wherein you told us that if we did not
                            <lb/>leave off drinking whiskey you would be discouraged<lb/>from trying
                            to help us, but if we would leave off and<lb/>become sober men, you
                            would be encouraged to as-<lb/>sist us as you could. That letter we have
                            yet. [They<lb/>then produced the letter to us and we found it
                            was<lb/>written by <persName key="tstew1">Thos. Stewardson</persName>
                            and myself, and our<lb/> names were signed to it]. Now, brothers, we
                            are<lb/>often counselling together about it, and are determ-<lb/>ined to
                            refrain from the use of it, and although some<lb/>few of our young men
                            sometimes break over our res-<lb/>olution, we think we are gaining
                            ground or strength<lb/>in the good undertaking; and of all the chiefs
                            and<lb/>warriors that are now present, we believe not one has<lb/>been
                            drunk for more than two years past, and some<lb/>for a longer time than
                            that, and divers of us have not<lb/> drunk any; so we are encouraged to
                            be strong in full<lb/>hope that we shall banish it altogether.</p>

                <p>In the evening the chief warrior's daughter, who<lb/>is an amiable young woman,
                    came home from a visit<lb/> at <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo,</placeName>
                    accompanied by a young man her rela-<lb/>tion. On their way they discovered a
                    young deer<lb/>about half-grown, in the edge of <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie,</geogName> which<lb/>they chased with their canoe and killed with
                    their<lb/>setting poles and brought it home. Some of the<lb/> meat added to the
                    satisfaction of our supper. After<lb/>their arrival, <persName key="wauun1"
                        >Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName> introduced his daugh-<lb/>ter to us all, one by
                    one, holding her by the hand;<lb/>and she without any appearance of unbecoming
                    shy-<lb/>ness shook hands with us all, in a modest manner,<lb/>which altogether
                    appeared so becomingly polite that<lb/>we could not help noticing it with
                    peculiar pleasure.<lb/>On taking leave of him in the morning, he in
                    a<lb/>weighty and feeling manner expressed: "We are<lb/>glad you have stayed two
                    nights with us, and I hope<lb/>the Great Spirit will look down upon you and
                    pre-<lb/>serve you in your long journey, and favor you with a<lb/>clear sky, so
                    that you may get home in good health<lb/> and find your wives and children
                    so."</p>
                <pb n="595" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_31"/>
                <p>We then withdrew a few minutes to confer upon<lb/>their proposals and requests,
                    and soon returned to in-<lb/> form them what we agreed upon. <persName
                        key="jshoe1">John Shoemaker</persName><lb/>rose and informed them<lb/> that
                    we believed it would not<lb/>be best to send one boy only, because he would be
                    likely<lb/>to feel himself lonesome and so become uneasy;<lb/>neither did we
                    think it would be best to send one<lb/>younger than 13 years, lest when the
                    older one had<lb/>served out his time and had gone home, the younger<lb/>one
                    would be uneasy. But if they could get two or<lb/>three boys of good disposition
                    and near of an age who<lb/> would be willing to come and work as some of
                    our<lb/>children do, we should be willing to accept of them<lb/> and use our
                    endeavours to instruct them.</p>
                <p>Then <persName key="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName>informed them
                    that<lb/>although we had not proposed to do any great matters<lb/>for them, yet
                    as they appeared desirous of improv-<lb/>ing, we were willing to assist them a
                    little, and would<lb/>send them a pair of bellows, an anvil, vise, and
                    some<lb/>other tools to begin with, if they thought <persName key="sjemi1">Sam
                        Jemi-<lb/>son,</persName> (who has been instructed in the business
                        at<lb/><placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>), would come and do
                    their work; also<lb/>we would furnish them with one hundred lbs. of iron,<lb/>a
                    set of plow-irons, and some steel to begin with.</p>
                <p><persName key="wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName> then replied: <said
                        who="wauun1">"You are wiser<lb/>than we, and we believe have come to a good
                        conclu-<lb/>sion about the boys, and we think we shall be likely<lb/>to get
                        two pretty near of an age in a few weeks, who<lb/>will be willing to go, and
                        whose parents and rela-<lb/>tions will consent to their going. And if any of
                        our<lb/>boys are sent, we want them taught to work as your<lb/>children are;
                        for it will be of very little use for them<lb/>just to learn to read and
                        write if they do not know<lb/>how to work.</said></p>
                <p>During almost all the time of the council, I think<lb/>that notwithstanding they
                    are a very dirty, mean<lb/>people in and about their houses, cookery, etc.,
                    I<lb/>never felt a greater flow of near affection to any<lb/>people, accompanied
                    with what I took to be an as-<lb/> surance that their souls are as precious in
                    the eyes of<lb/>Him who is impartial in judging of the inmost re-<lb/>cesses of
                    the heart, as ours are who have been blessed<lb/>with so many inexpressible
                    favours; (I fear too often<lb/>with but little sense of gratitude; to the
                    Great<lb/> Spirit for influencing our hearts to take pity on them,<lb/>and to us
                    in manifesting our kindness, insomuch that<lb/>I could not suppress a flow of
                    tears; and although a<lb/>good deal had been said on both sides, it being
                    likely<lb/>I should never have the same or a like opportunity,<lb/>I thought I
                    could not leave them easy without en-<lb/>deavoring to open to them the real
                    cause of our com-<lb/> ing; the origin of the concern which the Society
                    is<lb/>engaged in for their good; that the good men in our<lb/>Society always
                    loved our Indian brothers, and during<lb/>the whole time the white people and
                    Indians were at<lb/>war and killing one another, we had no hand in it
                    nor<lb/>could not be at war with anybody, but were sorry for<lb/>it. And
                    although we had no outward power in our<lb/>hands, generally when treaties were
                    appointed be-<lb/>tween the white people and themselves, some of us<lb/>attended
                    to try to keep them from being cheated.</p>
                <p>And when the war was over we were willing to try<lb/>to help and instruct them.
                    With much more similar<lb/>to what I expressed in the council at <placeName
                        key="genes1">Genesinguhta,</placeName><lb/> relative to the bad effects
                    attendant upon the use of<lb/>ardent spirits both upon white men and
                    Indians,<lb/> with a strong recommendation to them to endeavour<lb/>to avail
                    themselves in every respect of the opportu-<lb/> nity put into their power of
                    improving the little good<lb/>land they have left, and following the advice and
                    ex-<lb/> ample set and given them by our young men who re-<lb/>side with their
                    brother <orgName key="seneca">Senecas</orgName> on the <geogName key="alleg"

                    from <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> and view<lb/>their saw-mill. And
                    although we were desirous of<lb/>getting forward this afternoon, on our way to
                        <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo<lb/>Creek,</geogName> and made attempts to
                    conclude the council,<lb/>they were so pleased with our company that
                    it<lb/>seemed too hard for them to part with us; and the<lb/>chief warrior said
                    he was sorry and ashamed they<lb/> were not in a capacity to entertain us
                    better, but if<lb/>we would be so kind as to stay another night with<lb/>them
                    they would do the best they could, and <persName key="tecon1">Flying<lb/>
                        Arrow</persName> said he would bring as much corn as our<lb/>horses could
                    eat. For my part, I was not in a ca-<lb/>pacity to refuse their request and told
                    my companions<lb/>I would rather stay with them until the next morn-<lb/>ing. To
                    this they all consented and we informed<lb/>them so. They seemed much rejoiced;
                    the chief<lb/>warrior saying we had made the hearts of their<lb/>women and
                    children glad, and some more of them<lb/>would be glad to take us by the band.
                        <persName key="tecon1">Flying Arrow</persName><lb/>soon sent us plenty of
                    corn, and his father cut corn<lb/>tops enough and brought to our horses. The
                    chief<lb/>warrior's wife exerted herself in doing all she could<lb/>for us.
                    After the council was concluded and the most of<lb/>the Indians gone, also
                    Harry, who was our interpreter,<lb/>I had a good deal of very friendly
                    conversation with<lb/><persName key="wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName>, (our
                    landlord), <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> in-<lb/>terpreting. I
                    soon found there were such impres-<lb/>sions made upon his mind that it has
                    opened a door<lb/>to a large scope of inquiry; and I believe many<lb/>things
                    appeared in a fresh or new light to him. I<lb/>discovered him for some time to
                    be in a deep study;<lb/>at last he said there was one thing he wanted to
                    ask<lb/>but was afraid the question would not please us. We<lb/> told him he
                    might ask anything. He then said,<lb/>some time ago when he was at the
                        <placeName key="feder">Federal City,</placeName> on<lb/>his way there he saw
                    a great many black men that<lb/>were slaves to white men and looked miserable;
                    and<lb/>he wanted to know whether the Quakers kept any of<lb/>them. We told him
                    we did not, and did not think it<lb/>right. He seemed very much pleased. Many
                    things<lb/>more he asked; [so] that truly the undissembled ap-<lb/>pearace and
                    conduct of this man and his wife made<lb/>very pleasant impressions on all our
                    minds.</p>

                <p>EARLY in the morning on the <date when="1803-09-30">30th [of 9th
                        month,<lb/>1803]</date> we all set off and rode to <placeName key="buffa"
                        >New Amsterdam,</placeName> at the<lb/> mouth of <geogName key="buffc1"
                        >Buffalo Creek,</geogName>which is about thirty-three<lb/> miles, eight of
                    which is mostly bad road or path<lb/>through the woods to <geogName key="lakee"
                        >Lake Erie;</geogName> the other part of<lb/>the way is down the lake on the
                    margin. A very<lb/>pleasant ride, although each time I have ridden it I<lb/>have
                    been affected with the headache. A material<lb/>change appears to me to have
                    taken place on the<lb/>margin since I was along it four years ago.
                    The<lb/>beautiful beds of lime-stone are generally covered<lb/>with sand, and
                    much of the best kind of slate very<lb/>much gone. When we arrived at <placeName
                        key="buffa">Amsterdam,</placeName>
                    <persName key="redja1">Red<lb/>Jacket</persName>and several other Indian chiefs
                    were there<lb/>along with the mill-wrights who say they have com-<lb/>pleted the
                    saw-mill for the Indians and want their<lb/> pay. We sent for some of them and
                    desired to know<lb/>whether we could have them personally in council<lb/>
                    to-morrow at their village. <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName>
                    informed us<lb/>they would be glad if they could comply with our<lb/>desire, but
                    hoped we would have patience, for they<lb/>could not well meet us to-morrow, but
                    would meet<lb/>early the next day. We then conferred together and<lb/>
                    <persName key="ibons1">Isaac Bonsal</persName> and <persName key="gvaux1">George
                        Vaux</persName> were most easy to go<lb/>over the <geogName key="niaga"
                        >Niagara river</geogName> to-morrow in order to be at<lb/> the meeting at

                <p><persName key="jtayl1">Jacob<lb/>Taylor</persName> and myself went twelve miles
                    up the <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo<lb/>Creek</geogName> to see the new
                    saw-mill that is built for the<lb/>Indians, (we some time past having made them
                    a<lb/>present of all the iron), divers of the chiefs and one<lb/>
                    <pb n="611" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_33"/> of the undertakers attending. I
                    discovered it to be<lb/>an excellent seat, and it appeared to be a strong
                    mill;<lb/> but upon trial in our presence it was far from answer-<lb/>ing our
                    expectations according to the contract, by<lb/> not sawing half as fast as we
                    believed such a stream-<lb/>head and fall would do if the workmanship had
                    been<lb/>effectually executed. The chiefs said they were<lb/>ready to pay off
                    the contract if we would say it was<lb/>well done, according to contract; and on
                    our confer-<lb/>ring with the rest of our company the next day, we<lb/> advised
                    them not to pay off the contract until it was<lb/>completed. As I rode this
                    twelve miles up the creek<lb/> and back again through the Indian reserve I think
                    a<lb/>great part of it is equal if not superior to any piece<lb/> of land of
                    equal quantity I ever saw. I believe there<lb/>are more than a thousand acres
                    upon which there<lb/>might have been more than two tons of hay to the<lb/>acre
                    mowed and made the present year. </p>

                <p>In the morning we set<lb/>off and arrived at the Indian village, in their
                    council<lb/>house, about eleven o'clock; but we had to wait until<lb/>near four
                    in the afternoon before what we thought a<lb/>competent number collected. They
                    generally appear<lb/>to be a more indolent, careless, and some of
                    them<lb/>intemperate people than those at <placeName key="alleg1"
                        >Allegheny</placeName> and <placeName key="catta1"

                    going back or opening the council. They<lb/>then went in the council house and
                    after sitting a<lb/>short space, <persName key="tstew1">Thomas
                        Stewardson</persName> in a brief manner<lb/>informed them the reason of our
                    coming into their<lb/>settlement; and although there did not appear to be<lb/>
                    the same desire of improvement in many of the In-<lb/>dians in this settlement
                    as those we have been at be-<lb/>fore, which I believe is much owing to the
                    opportu-<lb/>nity they have of being corrupted by the example of<lb/>white
                    people at <placeName key="buffa">New Amsterdam,</placeName> which is a very
                    dis-<lb/>sipated place, yet he felt encouraged to endeavor to<lb/>stimulate them
                    to industry and to refrain from spirit-<lb/>uous liquors. It was not a very
                    comfortable, animat-<lb/>ing time as yet with them, yet I was not easy to
                    omit<lb/>opening divers matters to their consideration in a<lb/>summary way,
                    which contained a good deal of the<lb/>heads of what I mentioned at the other
                    places; which<lb/>seemed to attract their attention. I also informed<lb/>them I
                    had seen a good deal of the land contained<lb/> in their reserve that is
                    excellent; and if they would<lb/>be industrious they might live well; but if
                    they would<lb/>not, but followed the practice of drinking, they would<lb/>lose
                    the little good land they now have, their wives<lb/>and children would have to
                    lie down under the snow<lb/>and go to sleep without anything to eat or to
                    keep<lb/>them warm. </p>
                <p><persName key="jshoe1">John Shoemaker</persName> advised them to settle
                    farther<lb/> up the creek, where the land is so very good, and not<lb/>strive to
                    huddle together so close; which advice<lb/>seemed to please them very well.</p>
                <p><persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> then addressed us in a polite and
                    mas-<lb/> terly manner in which he displayed his talents as an<lb/>orator in a
                    methodical and flowery style near half an<lb/>hour. He took in every part of the
                    advice commu-<lb/>nicated to them by us, in regular order, and para-<lb/>phrased
                    upon it, with the frequent expression of<lb/>thanks to the Quakers, recounting
                    their kindness to<lb/>the Indian from the first settlement of <placeName
                        key="penns">Pennsylvania;</placeName><lb/>and concluded with endeavoring to
                    assure us if we<lb/>would come and see them two years hence, we should<lb/>find
                    them much improved in farming, and also in<lb/>the disuse of whiskey. And
                    notwithstanding I be-<lb/>lieved his speech was calculated to endeavor to
                    please<lb/>us, and that there was much less sincerity or reality<lb/>in his
                    intentions than in those of whom we have<lb/>conferred with before, yet I could
                    have sat, I think,<lb/>patiently two or three hours to hear him exert
                    his<lb/>smooth, oily, oratorical abilities.</p>
                <p>We then left them. <persName key="young1">Young King</persName> and <persName
                        key="polla1">Pollard</persName> in<lb/>a particular manner parted with us
                    very affectionate-<lb/>ly. Returned to our lodging at a tavern in <placeName

                    either linen or woollen, upon any of us<lb/>when we returned. I having four

                    appeared more astonishingly great and beau-<lb/>tiful than I had ever seen it
                    before, it being a clear<lb/>morning, and viewing the great fall and the
                    dash-<lb/>ing of the huge and confused rolls of water over the<lb/>rocks in the
                    rapids between us and the sun, to be<lb/>sure appeared amazingly grand and
                    gratifying. We<lb/>then rode four or five miles to view the whirlpool,<lb/>which
                    four years ago I thought as great a curiosity as<lb/>the other; yet I was
                    disappointed now, though it ap-<lb/>peared a wonderful place, but very far
                    inferior to<lb/>what it did then; there being but few logs in it,
                    and<lb/>whether it was owing to the stillness of the day or<lb/>from some other
                    cause, I know not, there did not<lb/>appear the sucks formed taking down the
                    logs, nor the<lb/>very great agitation there was then. We then rode
                        to<lb/><persName key="wlund1">Wm. Lunday's</persName>; dined; and thence to

                        >Batavia</placeName> which is<lb/>the county town of a new county called

                    the woods and settle, it being chiefly men from<lb/>those states who emigrate

                    to be very much increased since I<lb/>was here before. It was silent to-day. We

                    Many subjects of a religious nature were<lb/>conversed upon which I believe

                    view<lb/>the improvements made by these Eastern people,<lb/>which exceed what
                    can be conceived in the idea of a<lb/> Pennsylvanian or more southern man, for
                    the time.<lb/>They seem as if there were scarcely anything too hard<lb/>or too
                    heavy for them to undertake and go through<lb/>with, especially in opening a new
                    country heavily<lb/>timbered. Said <persName key="alaph1">Lapham</persName>,
                    though he does not appear<lb/>a robust man, has made a surprising
                    improvement<lb/>for the fime he has been settled here which is about<lb/>eight
                    years; and although there has been an uncom-<lb/>mon drought in this country
                    this year, they have made<lb/>250 cheeses this summer, many of which will
                    weigh<lb/>fifty pounds, and but very few less than thirty pounds,<lb/> which, to
                    be sure, in their cheese-house has a beauti-<lb/>ful appearance. Although I have
                    such an opinion of<lb/>the Eastern men in opening the wilderness, I
                    think<lb/>they are far short of a good Pennsylvania farmer in<lb/>keeping their
                    farms in good order after they have them<lb/>cleared. We propose to lodge

                    who<lb/>seem disposed to do everything they can to accommo-<lb/>date us. The

                    feed upon the acorns and beech nuts<lb/> which are very plenty, and have agreed

                    about two months; these they call <q>hog shep-<lb/>herds.</q></p>

                <p> We all set off, <persName key="jjone1">Joseph Jones</persName> still
                    accompany-<lb/>ing us, and rode twenty-three miles to Bartel's mill,<lb/>where
                    we got an excellent dinner. Here we met with<lb/><persName key="tclar1">Thomas
                        Clark</persName>, the turnpike man, who appeared in<lb/>distress. Said three
                    of his children were dead, and<lb/>the other one had been very bad, and [was]
                    not quite<lb/>well. His wife had lain sick and in distress for nearly<lb/>three
                    months, and had not yet the use of all her<lb/> limbs. She now says she would
                    not stay in this<lb/>country for all the land in it; so he proposes to
                    try<lb/>to move her and his one child into our neighborhood<lb/> again. The most
                    of the way from <placeName key="jerus">Jerusalem</placeName> here,<lb/> is their
                    land. We rode in the morning several miles<lb/>in sight of the <geogName

                    some distance we came in sight of it to<lb/>our left, and saw where it empties
                    into <geogName key="mudla">Mud Lake</geogName>.<lb/>Rode down near that to this
                    mill which is on the<lb/>outlet called <geogName key="mudcr">Mud

                    little<lb/>lakes, it being most of the way through a low piece<lb/>of land
                    covered with lofty white pine, though not<lb/>very large, and, I think, an
                    unhealthy place. Thirty-<lb/>two miles.</p>

                <p>I rose up out of bed about four o'clock this<lb/>morning, haing had, I think, the

                    found<lb/>it was in vain to stand them battle, I submitted and<lb/>surrendered
                    to them. But let me be as passive as I<lb/> would, they gave me no quarter, but
                    continued to use<lb/>their offensive weapons upon me full as much as if<lb/>I
                    had been striving to aggravate them; until I<lb/>thought best to plan a retreat,
                    and am glad to escape<lb/>with whole bones, but am afraid some of them
                    will<lb/>follow or keep with me all day. About six o'clock<lb/>we all set off
