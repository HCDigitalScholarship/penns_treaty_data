                <p> The James Cooper manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed Cooper’s manuscript as part of a larger project to make
                    the library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: Ashley Acle (3-10), Nilo Bermeo (11-18), Youda Cao
                    (19-26), Christine DeNizio (27-42), Anna Sagaser (43-50), and Brent Stanfield
                    (51-58). Transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by
                    Professor Murray. </p>
            </projectDesc>
            <editorialDecl>
                <p>The transcribers and editor attempted to render James Cooper’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when Cooper’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of Cooper’s Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans
                    who populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and
                    editor attempted to remain faithful to Cooper’s Anglicized spellings in all
                    cases.</p>
                <p>The author of the original journal, James Cooper, does not include page numbers
                    on his manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers
                    to correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>
