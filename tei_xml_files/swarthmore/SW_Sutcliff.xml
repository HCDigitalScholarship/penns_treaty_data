                <head>Preface </head>
                <p>The narrative and observations now pre-<lb/> sented to the public, were the
                    fruits of a voyage<lb/> undertaken solely with commercial views. They<lb/> were
                    written without any expectation of their be-<lb/> ing copied, and without the
                    remotest thought of<lb/> publication. But falling accidentally under the<lb/>
                    notice of the Editor, he was pleased with perusing<lb/> them, and believed that,
                    if printed, they would<lb/> also be agreeable to many others. He
                    accordingly<lb/> communicated this idea to the writer, who, after<lb/>
                    considering the subject, with a proper degree of<lb/> modesty, consented to the
                    proposal. </p>
                <p>If the reader should derive amusement or<lb/> instruction from this work, he will
                    naturally wish<lb/> to know something respecting the author. He is<lb/> the
                    second son of the late Doctor Abraham Sutcliff,<lb/> who practised, with much
                    skill and reputation, as<lb/> a physician, in Sheffield, and who died there
                    about<lb/> twelve years since. At Sheffield, the author, who<lb/><pb n="iv" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_iv"/>
                    was born and educated in the religious Society of<lb/> Friends, served his
                    apprenticeship; and afterwards<lb/> settled there in business as a merchant. In
                    this<lb/> line he continued for several years, and dealt ex-<lb/> tensively with
                    transatlantic connexions; which,<lb/> after some time, rendered it expedient for
                    him to<lb/> make two voyages to America, for the settlement<lb/> of his affairs.
                    The latter voyage and the travels<lb/> subsequent to it, comprise the
                    transactions which<lb/> are now offered to the public. </p>
                <p>In the year 1806, the author returned to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>, and continued there till the year
                    1811;<lb/> when he conceived that a residence in America,<lb/> might prove more
                    advantageous to him. He ac-<lb/> cordingly, with his wife and one daughter, the
                    only<lb/> surviving child of a very numerous family, em-<lb/> barked for
                    New-York, in the sixth month last,<lb/> with the view of settling in that
                    country. </p>
                <p>Whilst the author was in America, he had<lb/> frequent intervals of leisure,
                    which the nature of<lb/> his mercantile concerns rendered unavoidable. Of<lb/>
                    some of these opportunities he availed himself, to<lb/> visit his connexions and
                    friends in various parts of<lb/> the country; having also the view of gratifying
                    his<lb/><pb n="v" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_v"/> curiosity, and enlarging the sphere of his informa-<lb/>
                    tion. Being a man of observation, of a strong<lb/> memory and benevolent
                    disposition, and having<lb/> formed an extensive acquaintance with
                    respectable<lb/> persons in America, by whom he was treated with<lb/> kindness
                    and attention; he seems to have been<lb/> qualified to render an account of his
                    travels both<lb/> pleasing and interesting. The Editor therefore<lb/> ventures
                    to presume, that many of the remarks<lb/> and occurrences contained in this
                    little volume,<lb/> will prove useful as well as amusing to juvenile<lb/>
                    readers; and that they will not be destitute of<lb/> information to persons of
                    mature years. The<lb/> narrative appears to be judicious, and is given<lb/> with
                    great simplicity; and the Editor has not the<lb/> least doubt of its strict
                    veracity. The anecdotes<lb/> rise naturally from the subject, and are
                    generally<lb/> of a curious, novel, and instructive nature. They<lb/> are
                    numerous, and form a peculiar and striking<lb/> feature of the work. On the
                    whole, the Editor<lb/> persuades himself, that these travels will not be<lb/>
                    unacceptable to the generality of readers. </p>

                <p>After having taken leave of my relations and<lb/> friends in <placeName
                        key="sheff">Sheffield</placeName>, I left home with my wife and<lb/>
                    children. As our road lay through <placeName key="castl">Castleton</placeName>,
                    we<lb/> visited <placeName key="peaks">Peak's Hole</placeName>, which was a
                    great gratification<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_002"/>to the children, who had never before seen a natural<lb/> curiosity
                    of equal interest. The habitations within<lb/> the cavern, With the manufactory
                    of pack-thread<lb/> that was carrying on there, had a very singular and<lb/>
                    striking effect, which had something in it more like<lb/> a dream or a vision,
                    than a transaction of real life.<lb/> Yet I did not perceive on the countenances
                    of<lb/> those who were employed in this subterraneous<lb/> abode, less
                    appearance of being happy or cheerful,<lb/> than we see upon the faces we meet
                    in the<lb/> crowded streets of towns and cities:--Such is the<lb/> force of
                    habit. </p>
                <p>After taking some refreshment, we set out upon<lb/> our next stage; and,
                    believing it would be some<lb/> relief to the horses, I walked up the
                    Winyards,<lb/> which, though a laborious walk, is far from being<lb/> an
                    unpleasant one. This is, perhaps, one of the<lb/> most romantic roads in this
                    country, on account of<lb/> the steep and lofty mountains through which it<lb/>
                    winds its way; and, after having ascended the<lb/> summit, a very different
                    scenery is presented to<lb/> the view: The most fruitful and populous part
                    of<lb/> the counties of Lancaster and Chester lying in<lb/> full prospect before
                    the eyes of the traveller, pre-<lb/> sents something like the appearance of one
                    vast<lb/> city intermixed with fields and woods. </p>
                <p>In the evening, we arrived safe at <placeName key="manch"
                    >Manchester</placeName>.<lb/> There we were hospitably entertained at the house<lb/>

                    dying, and printing works. We were<lb/> also shown a beautiful collection of
                    dried speci-<lb/> mens of herbs, flowers, &amp;c. the production of<lb/> Botany
                    Bay. These he had received from an<lb/> ingenious young man who had been
                    transported<lb/> into that country when but a boy on a charge<lb/> of pilfering;
                    of which, I understood, it was ge-<lb/> nerallv believed he was innocent. His
                    habits of<lb/> industry and care did not forsake him, although<lb/> thrown
                    amongst such a set of companions as Botany<lb/> Bay and a Transport Ship may be
                    supposed to<lb/> furnish; and, in a few years, he had acquired<lb/> property to
                    a considerable amount. </p>

                <p> Having concluded to take our<lb/> passage in one of the packet-boats which go

                    where we dined, being<lb/> about 18 miles. This is an easy mode of
                    travelling<lb/> both as to expense and fatigue; and when upon a<lb/> canal like

                    children, we paid a visit to<lb/> the Asylum for the Blind ; an institution well
                    worthy<lb/> the support of the wealthy, where many persons<lb/> who have lost
                    their sight, are instructed in various<lb/> branches of business, by which they
                    are enabled to<lb/> pass their time usefully, and agreeably to them-<lb/>
                    selves. After visiting this institution, we walked<lb/> to the Botanic Garden.
                    Our relation being a sub-<lb/> scriber, had the privilege of introducing us
                    as<lb/> strangers; and we spent a pleasant hour or two,<lb/> having, in the
                    compass of a few acres of land, an<lb/> opportunity of seeing a vast variety of
                    plants, flowers,<lb/> shrubs, and trees, natives of every quarter of the<lb/>
                    world, alive and flourishing as in the countries<lb/> from which they are
                    brought. Amongst them I<lb/> noticed the banana and the sugar cane. </p>

                    concluded to take my passage in her<lb/> to New-York; for which I paid 35

                <p>In the afternoon of this day,<lb/> I was requested by the Captain to be in

                    being<lb/> no appearance of a change, we all came on shore<lb/> in the morning,
                    and I returned to my wife and<lb/> children. This was, I believe, an agreeable

                    and the probability that we might never<lb/> see each other more, on this side

                    the evening before; and now, to have almost a<lb/> certainty of spending another
                    day with my wife,<lb/>
                    <pb n="6" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_006"/> children, and near relatives, seemed to me a privi-<lb/> lege almost

                <p>This morning my wife and<lb/> children, with part of cousin B.'s family, and<lb/>
                    M. M. of Rochdale, accompanied me on board <lb/>the Laura, then lying about a
                    mile from <placeName key="liver">Liverpool</placeName><lb/> near the Cheshire
                    shore. As our boat passed by<lb/> the Princess, a ship of war, then lying in
                    the<lb/> Mersey, we were a little entertained by the ship's<lb/> crew being
                    ordered to man the rigging, just as we<lb/> were along side of them. In a few
                    moments after<lb/> the word of command was given, the shrouds of<lb/> every mast
                    appeared covered with seamen, from the<lb/> deck to the heads of the masts;
                    having the ap-<lb/> pearance of three lofty pyramids; each beginning<lb/> with a
                    file of men at the bottom, and finishing at<lb/> the top with a single
                    individual. After spending<lb/> about an hour, and taking some refreshment
                    on<lb/> board the Laura, we all returned safe to <placeName key="liver"
                        >Liverpool</placeName>,<lb/> where I slept this night. </p>

                <p>The wind becoming<lb/> more favorable, we received orders to be ready<lb/> to go
                    on board again in the evening; so I again<lb/> took leave of my wife and
                    children; but as I had<lb/>
                    <pb n="7" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_007"/> before to return on shore, and the winds con-<lb/> tinued variable,
                    there was a probability that I<lb/> might have to return to them again in the
                    morn-<lb/> ing. These circumstances took away a little of the<lb/> edge of our
                    anxiety at parting, and rendered it not<lb/> quite so formidable as our first
                    taking leave on the<lb/> 29th ult. My cousin T. B. and W. B. accom-<lb/> panied
                    us to the water-side, where a boat was<lb/> waiting for us. We got safe to the
                    vessel, which<lb/> lay at anchor the whole of this night. The next<lb/> morning,
                    being <date when="1804-06-02">6th Month, 2d</date>, as the seamen<lb/> were
                    raising the anchor, we were visited by R. B.<lb/> who kindly came at six o'clock
                    in the morning<lb/> to inquire after our welfare. What little wind<lb/> we had
                    was favourable; and it being a clear and<lb/> beautiful summer's day, the town
                    of <placeName key="liver">Liverpool</placeName>,<lb/> and country on both sides
                    the Mersey, appeared<lb/> to great advantage as we sailed down the river. </p>
                <p>After passing a little way into the Irish Channel<lb/> our Captain sent away the
                    Pilot. On the Pilot's<lb/> leaving our ship, the captain requested that
                    when<lb/> he got to his own vessel he would not present our<lb/> seamen with a
                    bottle of spirits as was commonly<lb/> done in such cases, alledging that his
                    men were<lb/> already so intoxicated they were scarcely able<lb/> to work the
                    ship. This circumstance, though<lb/> seemingly of small importance, had nearly
                    been of<lb/> serious consequence to us; and, for a time, there<lb/> seemed some
                    danger of a mutiny amongst the<lb/>
                    <pb n="8" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_008"/> men. Such was the sourness which it produced,<lb/> that, during the
                    whole voyage, they sullenly re-<lb/> fused the customary allowance from the
                    Captain,<lb/> of a bottle of brandy at the end of every week;<lb/> and, at one
                    time, a ring1eader in the business, who<lb/> had formerly served on board a ship
                    of war,<lb/> broke out into very abusive language to the Cap-<lb/> tain, and
                    treated him in such a manner that there<lb/> was some danger of the Captain
                    firing his pistol<lb/> at him. I was sorry to find that this man had<lb/> been
                    favoured with an education in our Society;<lb/> and that his mother was a
                    valuable friend. Not-<lb/> withstanding his bad conduct towards the
                    Captain,<lb/> he always behaved with kindness and attention<lb/> to me whenever
                    I came in his way and when I<lb/> spoke to him, which I did several times,
                    endea-<lb/> vouring to convince him of the impropriety of<lb/> his conduct, in
                    thus doing his utmost to break in<lb/> upon that subordination which was
                    necessary to<lb/> be maintained in every ship. </p>
                <p>After the pilot had left us, we proceeded along<lb/> the Welch coast, having the
                    mountains of North<lb/>
                    <placeName key="wales">Wales</placeName> in full view during the whole of the
                    day.<lb/> The weather being calm and clear, it is scarcely<lb/> in the power of
                    words to describe the gran-<lb/> deur of the prospect, which indeed was
                    such<lb/> that we could hardly regret the slow progress<lb/> we made. In the
                    afternoon, when opposite one<lb/> of the highest mountains, We were alarmed by<lb/>
                    <pb n="9" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_009"/> the noise of a very heavy discharge of cannon, from<lb/> one or two
                    vessels which were some distance<lb/> a-head of us. At first we supposed it to
                    be an<lb/> engagement between an English and a French<lb/> privateer; but, on
                    coming nearer, we had reason<lb/> to believe they were two slave ships, which
                    had left<lb/>
                    <placeName key="liver">Liverpool</placeName> a little before us, and had taken
                    the<lb/> opportunity of scaling their great guns, and exer-<lb/> cising their
                    men, when in a situation that would<lb/> produce the greatest echo and noise; a
                    disposition<lb/> very prevalent in the world. </p>
                <p>The night coming on, the beautiful and romantic<lb/> Welch scenery was hid from
                    us, and, next morning,<lb/> having made but little progress during the
                    night,<lb/> we found ourselves nearly opposite to <placeName key="holyh"
                        >Holyhead</placeName>.<lb/> Having been favoured with a smooth sea, we<lb/>
                    escaped sickness, and sat down to breakfast with<lb/> some appetite. Before we
                    rose from table, a ship<lb/> that was coming up the <geogName key="chann"
                        >Channel</geogName>, put out her boat<lb/> and made a signal to speak with
                    us. Our vessel<lb/> was accordingly managed in a way to put them<lb/> to as
                    little trouble as possible; and they soon<lb/> reached us. On their coming on
                    board, we found the<lb/> ship was the Liverpool, from <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName> to <placeName key="liver">Liver-<lb/>
                    pool</placeName>; and the Captain being an old acquaintance<lb/> of the Master
                    of our ship, they were rejoiced to<lb/> see each other. After an exchange of
                    intelligence<lb/> and news papers, we parted from her, and sailed<lb/> slowly
                    round the head of <placeName key="holyh">Holy-head</placeName>, and soon had<lb/>
                    <pb n="10" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_010"/> a fine prospect of <geogName key="caerb">Caernarvon Bay</geogName>;
                    but before the<lb/> evening closed, the sky was overcast, and the wind<lb/> got
                    up, so that we were under the necessity of<lb/> taking in a great part of our
                    sails; and several of<lb/> us began to be very sick. </p>
                <p>In the course of the night, which was very dark,<lb/> the wind became contrary;
                    and it was with great<lb/> difficulty we got through the narrow part of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="chann">Channel</geogName>, near <placeName key="stdav">St.
                        David's Head</placeName>, without fairly<lb/> putting back towards
                        <placeName key="liver">Liverpool</placeName>. The passage<lb/> was not
                    accomplished, without several times tack-<lb/> ing from one coast to the other;
                    and, could I have<lb/> had the management, I would gladly have put the<lb/> ship
                    into <placeName key="milfh">Milford Haven</placeName>, and did advise the
                    Captain<lb/> to do it. However, we had cause to be thankful<lb/> that we got
                    well out of this narrow sea, although<lb/> not without imminent danger of losing
                    our cabin-<lb/> boy, who was washed overboard as he was carry-<lb/> ing the
                    knives and forks from the caboose to the<lb/> cabin; but, in passing through the
                    railing, he got<lb/> entangled among some ropes which hung from<lb/> the rail,
                    and was thus providentially preserved.<lb/> Nearly our whole stock of table
                    knives and forks<lb/> were lost, which was a great inconveniency to us,<lb/>
                    especially being just at the commencement of our<lb/> voyage; however I did not
                    regret the loss of the<lb/> knives and forks, seeing the boy's life was
                    preserved.<lb/> This accident made so strong an impression upon<lb/> the poor
                    lad, that he never recovered his spirits<lb/> during the voyage. </p>
                <pb n="11" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_011"/>
                <p>Our first mate being an active man, made us a<lb/> few table forks from an old
                    barrel hoop, using the<lb/> anchor as an anvil. These, with our pocket-<lb/>
                    knives, served as a substitute for those we had lost.<lb/> This little
                    occurrence manifests the propriety of<lb/> passengers providing themselves each
                    with an<lb/> extra knife and fork. </p>
                <p>About two days after this, we got clear of both<lb/> the English and Irish coast,
                    and made a rapid<lb/> progress on our way across the Atlantic. There<lb/> seemed
                    every probability of our being favoured<lb/> with a short passage; but, in a
                    voyage at sea, as<lb/> in the voyage of life, it often happens that our<lb/>
                    prospects are not realized. </p>
                <p>After about two weeks of fair wind in the gene-<lb/> ral, we began to experience
                    hard gales, and from<lb/> unfavourable quarters; so that for a week or ten<lb/>
                    days, we made but little way. The patience of our<lb/> Captain being a good deal
                    tried, and his temper<lb/> somewhat soured, he was liable to use harsh lan-<lb/>
                    guage to his people, and particularly to a black<lb/> man who was steward of the
                    ship. On one occasion,<lb/> the ship had laid to for several hours, not
                    being<lb/> able to carry any sail, excepting a single one to<lb/> steady her. In
                    this state she was left to drift be-<lb/> fore the wind, which was then, to use
                    the Captain's<lb/> expression, blowing a hurricane, and she was of<lb/> course a
                    good deal agitated. The waves, according<lb/>
                    <pb n="12" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_012"/> to the seamen's phrase, were running mountains<lb/> high. It
                    happened, under these circumstances, that<lb/> one of the passengers, by a
                    sudden roll of the ves-<lb/> sel, was near being thrown down the stairs into
                    the<lb/> cabin; but, catching hold of the mahogany hand<lb/> rail, he saved
                    himself at the expense of breaking<lb/> the rail. This the Captain did not
                    observe till night<lb/> when we were all seated in the cabin. Then<lb/> he fell
                    upon the poor black man, with vio-<lb/> lent and abusive language, charging him
                    with<lb/> breaking the rail. After his passion was somewhat<lb/> subsided, I
                    told him that I was a witness that the<lb/> black man was innocent of what he
                    had charged<lb/> him with; that, considering the kind of day we had<lb/> passed
                    over, there was great cause to be thankful no<lb/> other damage had been
                    sustained than the breaking<lb/> of the hand rail, and that, so far from giving
                    way<lb/> passion at trifling things in such a time as this, our<lb/> minds ought
                    rather to be impressed with gratitude,<lb/> that we had been providentially
                    preserved through<lb/> the storm. </p>
                <p>At first, the Captain seemed offended at my free-<lb/> dom, and turned from me in
                    displeasure. Nothing<lb/> more was said at that time; however, after we
                    were<lb/> all in bed, and the passengers mostly asleep, he<lb/> called to me,
                    and, on my answering him, he said,<lb/> that he was convinced of the justice of
                    my obser-<lb/> vations; was obliged to me for the hints I had<lb/> dropped, and
                    that he was sorry for his having<lb/>
                    <pb n="13" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_013"/> given way to passion, when far other sentiments<lb/> ought to have
                    possessed his mind. This acknow-<lb/> ledgement was ingenuous on the part of the
                    Cap-<lb/> tain; and I believe he slept no worse for it. </p>
                <p>In the course of the day, when the weather had<lb/> cleared up, altho' the wind
                    still blew very hard, and<lb/> the waves were rolling along in awful
                    grandeur;<lb/> while the ship was yet lying to and drifting before<lb/> the
                    wind, the other passengers and myself went upon<lb/> the upper part of the
                    quarter deck, that we might<lb/> have a full view of the sea when thus agitated,
                    and<lb/> appearing in all its majesty. There is something in<lb/> such a scene
                    exceedingly humiliating. The most<lb/> powerful of men, when thus baffled and
                    riding on<lb/> the waves, every moment in danger of being swal-<lb/> lowed up,
                    are indeed but <quote type="biblical">as the small dust of the<lb/>
                        balance.</quote> Every sensible mind, when placed in<lb/> situations like
                    these, must be alive to the senti-<lb/> ment which that expression conveys. As
                    we thus<lb/> stood admiring how every wave, after rolling<lb/> along in majestic
                    greatness, seemed to break at<lb/> our feet before it reached the ship, the
                    first mate,<lb/> who was on the watch, called out aloud, for every<lb/> one to
                    take care of himself. Observing that he ran<lb/> and placed himself under the
                    quarter board, near<lb/> one of the stansions, I immediately followed his<lb/>
                    example, and, taking fast hold of the ropes, sat<lb/> down by him; which I had
                    scarcely done before one<lb/>
                    <pb n="14" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_014"/> of these huge waves rolled completely over the ship;<lb/> and we
                    were, for a short time, overwhelmed by it.<lb/> Such was the force with which it
                    struck the ship,<lb/> that she reeled to the other side, and really
                    trembled<lb/> under the stroke. One of the passengers having his<lb/> back
                    towards it, and not hearing the mate's warning,<lb/> was struck down with so
                    much violence, and pre-<lb/> cipitated to the other side of the vessel with so
                    much<lb/> force, that his head, striking against one of the<lb/> quarter boards,
                    broke the board in pieces; and a<lb/> pair of cloth pantaloons which he held in
                    his hands<lb/> at the time were washed overboard. Indeed we had<lb/> great cause
                    to be thankful to Divine Providence, that<lb/> we escaped without further loss
                    or damage; and it<lb/> was matter of admiration to me, that, whilst buried<lb/>
                    in the wave, my mind was preserved from any con-<lb/> siderable fear or anxiety
                    as to the consequences. </p>
                <p>At this time, we were, I believe, in the gulf<lb/> stream; for as the water
                    passed over us, it felt as<lb/> warm as new milk. The ship reeled so much
                    to<lb/> one side, at the stroke of the sea, that we had a<lb/> second immersion
                    as she righted, after recovering<lb/> from the shock. As it had blown a hard
                    gale all<lb/> the preceding night, the ocean was become so very<lb/> rough
                    pretty early in the morning, that a heavy sea<lb/> broke through the cabin
                    windows, and rolled into<lb/> the beds on one side of the ship; which
                    occasioned<lb/> a great alarm ; and I have seldom seen men rise<lb/> more
                    quickly from their beds than our companions<lb/><pb n="15" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_015"/> did on that side of
                    the cabin. A little time after the<lb/> storm had subsided, and the sea was
                    become calm,<lb/> we were entertained with the sight of a number of<lb/> flying
                    fish, which, from time to time, continued<lb/> to rise our of the sea, and after
                    taking short flights,<lb/> dropped again into the water. These flying fish
                    ap-<lb/> peared to be pursued by a number of dolphins,<lb/> which, for a
                    considerable time, kept company with<lb/> the ship, so as to give us a full
                    opportunity of ob-<lb/> serving their beautiful colours, continually
                    changing<lb/> to the various tints of azure, green and gold. The<lb/> gold
                    fishes, which we see confined in glass jars, are<lb/> very beautiful; but not at
                    all to be compared with<lb/> the dolphin, which is, besides a much larger
                    fish;<lb/> generally weiging 8 or 10 pounds. Our seamen<lb/> caught several of
                    them, and we found them very<lb/> good eating. Although the colours of the
                    dolphin<lb/> are exceedingly beautiful while alive and in motion<lb/> in the
                    sea, yet they are still more extraordinary when<lb/> the fish is taken out of
                    the water, and is in the<lb/> agonies of death; Displaying then, every colour
                    of<lb/> the rainbow, changing in rapid succession as long<lb/> as life remains.
                    As the dolphins were in pursuit<lb/> of the flying fish, so the dolphins in
                    their turn were<lb/> pursued by the sharks; and such is the activity of<lb/>
                    these voracious animals in seizing their prey, that,<lb/> whilst one of our
                    people was dragging up a dolphin,<lb/> as quickly as he possibly could, a huge
                    shark put up<lb/> his monstrous jaws and snatched the fish from<lb/> the hook. </p>
                <pb n="16" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_016"/>
                <p>The voracious shark also had his enemies; for<lb/> the sailors by throwing out
                    pieces of meat, enticed<lb/> him to come so near the ship, that one of the
                    com-<lb/> pany who stood upon the main-chains had an op-<lb/> portunity of
                    casting the noose of a strong rope over<lb/> his head; and the other end of the
                    rope being<lb/> passed through a block, he was quickly hoisted upon<lb/> deck,
                    where he lay some time striking the boards<lb/> with his tail with great
                    violence. It was curious to<lb/> see the agitation of the little pilot fishes,
                    which<lb/> accompanied the shark; and when he was dragged<lb/> out of the water,
                    they seemed to use their best<lb/> endeavours to follow him. </p>
                <p>The pilot fish is something like the mackerel;<lb/> but of a smaller size. On the
                    shark's being thrown<lb/> upon the deck, several sucking fish fell from him<lb/>
                    about 8 or 10 inches in length. These fishes, I<lb/> should suppose, are a
                    considerable annoyance to the<lb/> shark, sticking close to various parts of his
                    body<lb/> like a leech. The Captain not being willing that he<lb/> should he
                    killed, on account of the dirt and disagree-<lb/> able smell that he would make;
                    and the sailors not<lb/> being willing that he should escape punishment,<lb/>
                    wantonly tied a piece of wood about the size of a<lb/> common oar to his tail,
                    and then hoisted him again<lb/> and let him into the sea. Notwithstanding he
                    had<lb/> been out of the water more than a quarter of an<lb/> hour, the moment
                    he reached the sea, he dived<lb/> into the deep with the incumbrance at his tail,<lb/>
                    <pb n="17" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_017"/> apparently with the greatest ease, and was out of<lb/> sight in a
                    few seconds. </p>
                <p>Of the various kinds of fishes we saw on our pas-<lb/> sage, porpoises were the
                    most common. They are<lb/> large, weighing from 20 to 30 stone; yet we fre-<lb/>
                    quently saw large shoals of them extending as far<lb/> as the eye could reach,
                    and all driving along in<lb/> one direction; frequently leaping quite out of
                    the<lb/> water, and often passing close by the ship, so as to<lb/> afford the
                    sailors an opportunity of striking them<lb/> with the harpoon and dragging them
                    on board.<lb/> Some of the people, I observed, were partial to<lb/> the heart
                    and liver of this fish when fried, as-<lb/> serting that they were scarcely to
                    be distinguished<lb/> from those of a hog when dressed in the same<lb/> way. At
                    one time we were entertained by the<lb/> sight of several whales, five of which
                    passed close<lb/> to the ship, sporting and rolling along within a<lb/> few
                    yards of us; making a loud noise in snorting<lb/> and spouting up the water from
                    a hole in their<lb/> foreheads. These creatures were of large bulk,<lb/> and
                    appeared exceedingly fat and sleek; their<lb/> skins shining as if varnished. </p>
                <p>Although there does not appear any place of<lb/> rest for fowls in the wide
                    ocean, yet numbers of<lb/> them are daily seen riding light pieces of cork
                    on<lb/> the loftiest waves, and in the most tempestuous<lb/>
                    <pb n="18" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_018"/> weather. These are mostly of the petril tribe,<lb/> although
                    sea-gulls are often seen at a great dis-<lb/> tance from land, especially on the
                    banks of New-<lb/> foundland and in approaching them. </p>
                <p>In passing these banks it is wonderful to see the<lb/> thick fog which generally
                    prevails, so that, in a morn-<lb/> ing, the rigging and sails of the ship would
                    be drip-<lb/> ping wet, as though they had been in heavy shower<lb/> during the
                    night. In addition, the weather was so<lb/> cold that it was very uncomfortable
                    to be without<lb/> fire, although it was the middle of summer, and<lb/> we were
                    many more degrees southward<lb/> than <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>.
                    These heavy fogs when seen at a<lb/> distance had many times much the appearance
                    of<lb/> land; and about the time of the setting sun, they<lb/> presented a great
                    variety of appearances. Some-<lb/> times we might imagine we had the sight of
                    a<lb/> splendid city, with towers, domes, and steeples,<lb/> rising before us;
                    and, in a while, the whole would<lb/> entirely vanish, and leave nothing to be
                    seen but<lb/> the wide extended ocean, bounded by horizon. </p>
                <p>Being detailed nearly two weeks in the gulf<lb/> stream, by light and contrary
                    winds, our Captain<lb/> began to be anxious about the provisions and water,<lb/>
                    in consequence of which he put the men upon their<lb/> allowance of beef and
                    pork, which were now<lb/> handed to them by weight; and we ourselves were<lb/>
                    prohibited the use of fresh water, in washing our<lb/>
                    <pb n="19" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_019"/> hands and faces, and were obliged to use the sea<lb/> water which
                    is far from being pleasant. Besides,<lb/> having had a considerable loss by the
                    breakage of<lb/> ale and porter bottles, owing to their having been<lb/> put up
                    when the liquor was new, the passengers<lb/> and officers of the ship were
                    obliged to submit to<lb/> a certain allowance of these articles; and we now<lb/>
                    began to be more frugal of our fresh provisions<lb/> than heretofore. </p>
                <p>While our time was thus passing on in the gulf<lb/> stream, we were under some
                    apprehensions of be-<lb/> ing carried out of our course by the current; and<lb/>
                    the sea being often as smooth as a fish-pond, we<lb/> occasionally hoisted out
                    the boat, and taking an<lb/> iron pot, let it down into the sea, by which
                    means<lb/> the direction of the current was ascertained.<lb/> Some of us were at
                    the trouble of sealing up a<lb/> bottle, inclosing a paper containing the
                    latitude<lb/> and longitude; and, adding our names and places<lb/> of abode, We
                    requested that the person who<lb/> might pick it up would inform any of the
                    parties.<lb/> Although we had no great expectation of hearing<lb/> more of the
                    bottle after it was thrown into the<lb/> sea, yet I had not been long in America
                    before<lb/> the paper was handed to me, having been picked<lb/> up on the sands
                    near <placeName key="newpo">Newport</placeName>, in Rhode Island.<lb/> Thus,
                    contrary to the received opinion respecting<lb/> the current of the gulf stream,
                    it had been carried<lb/> in a north-westerly direction. There seemed no<lb/>
                    <pb n="20" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_020"/> of accounting for this circumstance, but by<lb/> supposing that the
                    action of the wind had made<lb/> the bottle deviate from the course of the
                    stream. </p>
                <p>Having considerable time on our hands, we<lb/> amused ourselves in little
                    experiments of this sort.<lb/> Several times we sunk well-corked empty
                    bottles<lb/> to a considerable depth into the sea; and although<lb/> great care
                    was taken to have the corks tight and<lb/> sealed, yet it was invariably the
                    case, when drawn<lb/> up again, that the corks were found pushed into<lb/> the
                    bottles, or that the bottles had filled with water<lb/> by its passing through
                    the pores of the cork. I have<lb/> already observed that the water in the gulf
                    stream<lb/> was warm as new milk; but on sinking a ther-<lb/> mometer some depth
                    in the sea, and hastily draw-<lb/> ing it up again, we found that the water
                    below<lb/> was as cold as in any other part. </p>
                <p>After a tedious time spent in the gulf stream, we<lb/> at length arrived on the
                    coast of North America;<lb/> and on 1st day morning, <date when="1804-07-29">the
                        29th of the 7th Month</date>,<lb/> we were favoured with the sight of Long
                    Island.<lb/> A little after noon, we ran close in shore, so much<lb/> so that
                    the ship was hastily put about, or she<lb/> would have touched the bottom in a
                    few minutes;<lb/> for, in turning round, she raked up the mud<lb/> so much as to
                    discolour the water to a con-<lb/> siderable degree; however we were soon in
                    deep<lb/> water again. Thus, after having been for 8 weeks<lb/>
                    <pb n="21" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_021"/> at sea, where the eye had been almost wearied<lb/> with a continued
                    sameness of prospects, and after<lb/> having had, for several hours, the
                    delightful pro-<lb/> spect of farm-houses and plantations, we again<lb/>
                    launched into the wide ocean. To be thus<lb/> snatched from green fields and
                    woods, and cheer-<lb/> ful habitations, was a trial of patience to some of<lb/>
                    our companions; and, all the afternoon, I noticed<lb/> an anxious looking
                    towards the land, in most of us. </p>
                <p>The next morning, about four o'clock, <date when="1804-07-30">7th<lb/> Month,
                        30th</date>, I was waked by the report of a<lb/> great gun, which was
                    followed by considerable<lb/> bustle upon deck. After getting up, I
                    understood<lb/> that a shot had been fired over us by an English<lb/> frigate,
                    called the Boston, which, in company with<lb/> the Leander and Cambrian men of
                    war, and Driver<lb/> sloop of war, was then cruizing near us; and<lb/> as the
                    cannon-ball that was fired over us, was an<lb/> earnest of what we might expect
                    if we did not<lb/> stop to receive an officer from the frigate, the<lb/>
                    topsails were immediately backed, and we short-<lb/> ened sail that they might
                    have an opportunity of<lb/> coming to us. A Lieutenant and Midshipman<lb/> were
                    sent on board. After spending about half<lb/> an hour in conversation with us,
                    and exchanging<lb/> intelligence and newspapers, they left the ship;<lb/> and,
                    at parting, observed that they believed all our<lb/> seamen were citizens of the
                    United States, and<lb/> therefore did not wish to examine them; but<lb/>
                    <pb n="22" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_022"/> that they hoped we would not hoist our sails until<lb/> we had a
                    signal from the frigate; which was com-<lb/> plied with. </p>
                <p>We were now again in sight of land, being near<lb/>
                    <placeName key="sandyh">Sandyhook</placeName>. Having a fine view of the
                        <geogName key="jersm">Jersey<lb/> Mountains</geogName>, and it being a clear
                    summer's morn-<lb/> ing, the country before us appeared exceedingly<lb/>
                    beautiful. In approaching the shore we observed<lb/> an appearance not less
                    beautiful in what I believe<lb/> is called a land-loom. The whole country
                    ap-<lb/> peared to be reflected in the atmosphere; some-<lb/> thing like what we
                    see from the banks of rivers,<lb/> when objects are reflected in the water.
                    But<lb/> here, instead of the images appearing in the water<lb/> united at
                    bottom to the objects, they were all re-<lb/> flected in the air, with their
                    tops downwards; and<lb/> each reflection seeming to touch the <emph
                        rend="italic">top</emph> of the<lb/> object reflected. </p>
                <p>The different ships of war, which I have just<lb/> mentioned, made a very gay
                    appearance; for<lb/> the weather being fine and clear, and but little<lb/> wind,
                    they had most of their sails spread, and<lb/> continued sailing to and fro
                    before <placeName key="sandyh">Sandyhook</placeName>;<lb/> the <geogName
                        key="never">Never-sink Mountains</geogName> being in the back<lb/> ground.
                    Their object was to watch two French<lb/> frigates then lying in <placeName
                        key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, as the Lieutenant<lb/> of the Boston
                    informed us, and, at the same time,<lb/> to examine all American ships in order
                    to discover<lb/> if there were any of the subjects of Great Britain<lb/>
                    <pb n="23" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_023"/> serving on board, with a view to impress them.<lb/> It appeared to
                    be an arduous and delicate situa-<lb/> tion in which the Commander of these
                    ships was<lb/> placed. Having to fulfil the orders of his Govern-<lb/> ment on
                    the one hand, and being in danger of<lb/> giving offence to the America on the
                    other, it<lb/> seemed impossible for him to steer clear, unless<lb/> possessed
                    of a very uncommon share of prudence<lb/> and discretion. </p>
                <p>In sailing up to <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, we passed by
                    the<lb/> two French frigates, called the Didon and the the<lb/> Sybille. They
                    appeared to be very full of men.<lb/> Soon after four o'clock in the afternoon,
                    we ar-<lb/> rived at that city; and coming along-side the<lb/> wharf, we were
                    handed on shore by J. W. who<lb/> kindly conducted us to our quarters, and we
                    were<lb/> soon after joined by A. B. who drank tea and<lb/> spent the evening
                    with us. Thus, after a passage<lb/> of 58 days, we were favoured to land safe
                    in<lb/> America, for which we have abundant cause to be<lb/> thankful. In
                    passing through the streets to our<lb/> lodgings, I was struck with the great
                    variety<lb/> of fruit exposed for sale; such as pine-apples,<lb/> melons of
                    various kinds, peaches, &amp;c. &amp;c. Me-<lb/> lons and pine-apples I bought
                    for 3d. or 4d. each,<lb/> and other fruit in proportion. On going to bed<lb/>
                    this evening, I found that after being so long<lb/> habituated to the motion of
                    the ship, I could<lb/> get scarcely any sleep. </p>

                <p>This morning I was<lb/> conducted by my companions to one of the Public<lb/>
                    Baths kept in the <placeName key="nycit">city of New-York</placeName>.
                    These<lb/> Baths are upon a plan I had not seen before. On<lb/> each side of a
                    long and spacious passage, is a<lb/> range of small rooms, in each of which is a
                    Bath<lb/> sufficient to accommodate one person; with suit-<lb/> able
                    conveniences for dressing and undressing. On<lb/> the side of each Bath are two
                    brass cocks, the<lb/> one furnishing warm and the other cold water; so<lb/> that
                    the bather may have the water at what tem-<lb/> perature he pleases. There is
                    also a valve, by<lb/> means of which, if there is more water than is<lb/>
                    pleasant, he may let part of it out. Some of these<lb/> Baths are made of white
                    marble; and are so con-<lb/> structed that a person may lie down or sit in
                    them.<lb/> So grateful it is to remain a considerable time in<lb/> them, in the
                    warm season of the year, that it<lb/> is a common practice for bathers to take
                    books<lb/> with them to read while they thus indulge them-<lb/> selves in the
                    Bath. There are also Baths in a<lb/> different part of the house set apart for
                    females. </p>
                <pb n="25" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_025"/>
                <p>After spending a little time at the Bath, we re-<lb/> turned to breakfast. On
                    sitting down to it, I<lb/> could not avoid noticing the difference there
                    was<lb/> betwixt an American and an English breakfast<lb/> table; and I took out
                    my pencil and put down the<lb/> different articles that were on the table before
                    me,<lb/> which were intended for four persons only. The<lb/> articles were as
                    follows:-coffee and tea, with rolls,<lb/> and bread and butter, broiled fish,
                    and cutlets,<lb/> hung beef, boiled eggs, a small species of lobster,<lb/>
                    radishes, and blackberries. The butter brought<lb/> upon the table, had a piece
                    of ice placed upon it,<lb/> which is a general practice in this country,
                    during<lb/> the summer. This keeps the butter as cool and<lb/> hard as in
                    winter. Most of this day was spent in<lb/> passing our luggage through the
                    custom-house;<lb/> and, it is but justice to the revenue officers in<lb/> this
                    country to notice, that they are very obliging<lb/> in their behaviour; and,
                    being allowed handsome<lb/> salaries, they are not in the practice of
                    taking<lb/> fees or bribes. </p>

                <p>Being invited by <persName key="fthom1">F. T.</persName> I ac-<lb/> companied him
                    to his country-house, about two<lb/> miles above <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName>, on the <geogName key="eastr">East River</geogName>,
                    where<lb/> I spent the evening and slept. Being in the heat<lb/> of summer, and
                    near the tide waters, I was con-<lb/> siderably annoyed with musquitoes. I
                    returned<lb/> with F. T. to <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName> the next
                    morning, and,<lb/>
                    <pb n="26" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_026"/> after attending <orgName key="nymm">the monthly meeting
                        there</orgName>, dined<lb/> at J. B.'s. The next day I set out in the<lb/>
                    mail stage for <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, in company
                    with<lb/> J. L. and J. F. On our way, we dined at <placeName key="newar"
                        >Newark</placeName>,<lb/> at Archibald Gifford's Tavern, and reached<lb/>
                    <placeName key="prince">Prince Town</placeName> to supper. The country we
                    passed<lb/> through was pleasantly diversified with hill and<lb/> dale; and the
                    luxuriant appearance of the fields<lb/> of Indian corn, had a very striking
                    effect upon one<lb/> who had not been much out of England. The<lb/> situations
                    and appearances of <placeName key="newar">Newark</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="prince">Prince<lb/> Town</placeName>, are particularly beautiful. But
                    it was<lb/> quite dark before we reached <placeName key="trent"
                        >Trenton</placeName>, so that our<lb/> coachman was unable to see his way,
                    in driving<lb/> into the ferryboat; and the wheels on one<lb/> side of the
                    carriage passing into the boat whilst<lb/> those on the other side went into
                        <geogName key="delaw">the Delaware</geogName>, we<lb/> narrowly escaped a
                    plunge into the water. The<lb/> passengers usually keep their seats in the
                    carriage<lb/> while it is ferried over the rivers in this country;<lb/> and, in
                    general, the horses are so well trained, that<lb/> they are driven in and out of
                    the boats without<lb/> any difficulty. On finding ourselves in this
                    perilous<lb/> situation, we all got out of the carriage into the<lb/> boat as
                    well as we could; which was no very easy<lb/> task, as it was quite dark, and we
                    were without<lb/> lamp or candle. The driver putting back his<lb/> horses, got
                    clear of the boat, and in his second<lb/> attempt drove fairly into it, and we
                    crossed the<lb/> river without further accident. </p>

                    got safe to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> to breakfast. Here

                    and many of them are planted with a row<lb/> of trees on each side. In walking
                    along them, I<lb/> was a good deal entertained with the loud, and<lb/> almost
                    incessant chirping which is heard from the<lb/> trees in the evening, after
                    sunset; and which I un-<lb/> derstood was chiefly occasioned by the tree
                    frog.<lb/> This species of frog makes its abode amongst the<lb/> branches of the

                <p>I attended the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="pqm">quarterly meeting for Philadelphia</orgName>, which,
                    though<lb/> one of the largest in America, did not continue<lb/> more than one
                    hour and a half, there being but<lb/> little business before it, besides
                    answering the<lb/> queries. As this was likely to be a very abundant<lb/>
                    <pb n="28" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_028"/> fruit year, and many friends had large orchards,<lb/> some
                    individuals very pressingly cautioned them<lb/> against suffering their cider to
                    be distilled. The<lb/> concern of friends, in this country, against the
                    fre-<lb/> quent use of spirituous liquors in their families, is<lb/> very great;
                    and probably it is not without just<lb/> cause. The trouble attendant on brewing
                    and pre-<lb/> serving malt liquor in warm climates is great; and,<lb/> on the
                    contrary, spirituous liquors are preserved<lb/> with so little difficulty, in so
                    little room, and at so<lb/> easy an expense, that most families, especially
                    in<lb/> the country, give them the preference as com-<lb/> mon beverage
                    throughout the year, when diluted<lb/> with water. It is not from cider alone
                    they pro-<lb/> cure spirits. Large quantities are also distilled<lb/> from the
                    juice of peaches. This is called peach<lb/> brandy, and possesses a peculiar
                    flavour and colour,<lb/> obtained from the kernels. The general price of<lb/>
                    brandies of these kinds is about 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d.<lb/> sterling per gallon;
                    and these are, when kept an<lb/> equal age, but little inferior to French
                    brandy.<lb/> After the quarterly meeting, I dined with T. S.'s<lb/> family,
                    being invited by him; and, after dinner,<lb/> took a walk with him through his
                    tan-yard. I ob-<lb/> served that they did not confine themselves to oak<lb/>

                <p>In the afternoon I accom-<lb/> panied some friends to take a view of the
                    skeleton<lb/> of a Mammoth, which was carefully put together<lb/> and set up in
                    a convenient room in the city. When<lb/> clothed with flesh, this animal must
                    have been of<lb/> enormous bulk. The tusks were upwards of six<lb/> feet in
                    length, and the leg bones appeared about<lb/> the thickness of the waist of a
                    middle sized person.<lb/> In comparing the bones of this animal with those<lb/>
                    of an elephant, a considerable difference is observed,<lb/> particularly about
                    the feet; those of the Mammoth<lb/> resembling the feet of a beast of prey more
                    than the<lb/> elephant, appearing to be armed with sharp claws.<lb/> One of the
                    claws, about eight inches in length, which<lb/> was found near the skeleton, I
                    had in my hands.<lb/> An animal of such bulk, so armed, must have been<lb/> very
                    destructive to the creatures around him. The<lb/> Indians have a tradition, that
                    on this account the<lb/> Great Spirit directed that the whole species
                    should<lb/> become extinct. Near the banks of the large<lb/> rivers in this
                    country, and generally near the salt<lb/> springs, the bones of these animals
                    are found. In<lb/> the inland parts of America all kinds of cattle are<lb/>
                    excessively fond of salt, and, as in other parts of<lb/> the world, there are
                    here many springs whose<lb/> waters are brackish. Contiguous to these
                    springs,<lb/> the clay and earth, over which the waters have<lb/> run, are
                    impregnated with salt; and to these<lb/> places, all kinds of wild cattle
                    frequently resort,<lb/> and are seen licking the earth with great eagerness.<lb/>
                    <pb n="30" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_030"/> These places are called Salt Licks, by the inhabi-<lb/> tants, and,
                    on the banks of the Ohio, is a place of<lb/> this sort, called the Bigbone Lick,
                    on account of<lb/> the great number of Mammoth bones which are<lb/> found buried
                    in its vicinity. From this it seems as<lb/> if these enormous creatures
                    stationed themselves<lb/> near the salt springs, that they might make a
                    prey<lb/> of the animals which resorted to them; and, it is<lb/> very probable,
                    that the old Mammoths, in particu-<lb/> lar, might station themselves in places
                    like these,<lb/> where, at last, they would die of old age. </p>

                <p>were spent in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>.<lb/> The next day,
                    accompanied by my brother J. S.<lb/> and T. W. I paid a visit to a relation at
                    his estate<lb/> above <placeName key="norrist">Norristown</placeName>, being
                    about twenty miles from<lb/> Philadelphia. This plantation, consists of 300<lb/>
                    acres of good land, 200 of which are cleared,<lb/> and 100 covered with wood.
                    The wood land is<lb/> the most valuable, being so convenient for the<lb/>
                    Philadelphia carpenters, &amp;c. On the estate is a<lb/> well finished square
                    stone house, about 15 yards in<lb/> length, with a wide boarded floor piazza,
                    both in<lb/> back and front. These afford excellent accom-<lb/> modation during
                    the summer season, which con-<lb/> tinues much longer, and in general is much
                    warmer<lb/> here than in England; as, in these piazzas, they<lb/> frequently
                    take tea and spend their evenings.<lb/> Besides the dwelling-house there is an
                    excellent<lb/> kitchen, and offices adjoining; with a large barn,<lb/>
                    <pb n="31" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_031"/> and stables sufficient to accommodate 40 horses<lb/> and cows; all
                    well built of stone. The estate<lb/> extends the whole breadth betwixt the
                        <geogName key="schri">Schuilkill</geogName><lb/> and <geogName key="perkri"
                        >Perkiomen</geogName>. On the former river there is a<lb/> Shad Fishery
                    which is of considerable value; and,<lb/> if prosecuted with spirit, might
                    supply many fa-<lb/> milies with fish for the whole year. The house is<lb/> so
                    situated that it commands one of the finest pro-<lb/> spects in Pennsylvania,
                    and, being on a rising ground,<lb/> is dry and healthy. The whole together
                    forms<lb/> one of the most beautiful spots I have seen in the<lb/> United
                    States. This estate, with all its appendages,<lb/> cost about 3600l. sterling,
                    which is but 12l. per<lb/> acre, the buildings included. There is also an
                    ex-<lb/> cellent orchard of about 10 acres planted with the<lb/> choicest
                    fruit-trees, which are just in their prime. </p>
                <p>This plantation was formerly in the possession<lb/> of a friend from London, of
                    the name of Vaux,<lb/> who built the house and made the improvements<lb/> upon
                    it. When he resided there with his family,<lb/> during the American war, being
                    in full view of<lb/> the great American encampment at <placeName key="vallf"
                        >Valley Forge</placeName>,<lb/> and on the opposite side of the <geogName
                        key="schri">river Schuilkill</geogName>,<lb/> he had frequently the company
                    of General Howe,<lb/> and the other British Commanders. One day it<lb/> happened
                    that he had Howe to breakfast and<lb/> Washington to tea; and being a friend who
                    wished<lb/> well to all men, he made no distinction between<lb/> the contending
                    parties, he left his house open to<lb/>
                    <pb n="32" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_032"/> all. This was the general practice of friends dur-<lb/> ing the
                    war, particularly with those who stood<lb/> true to the principles of their
                    profession: and this<lb/> proved the best policy; for though attended with<lb/>
                    some loss of provisions at the time, yet they were<lb/> generally preserved from
                    any serious suffering in<lb/> their persons, by their hospitable conduct. </p>

                <p>This being the 1st day of the<lb/> week, our relation conducted us to <orgName
                        key="meetprov">Providence<lb/> meeting</orgName>, a few miles distant from
                    his house. After<lb/> meeting we were kindly invited to dinner, by a<lb/> friend
                    who was a stranger to us. We felt and<lb/> acknowledged his kindness, but
                    returned with our<lb/> relation, in whose family we spent the remainder<lb/> of
                    the day. Notwithstanding this was the hottest<lb/> season of the year, we had a
                    very liberal supply of<lb/> ice upon the table; which I found my relation
                    had<lb/> the means of procuring without trouble or expence<lb/> to himself.
                    Amongst the buildings in his purchase<lb/> was an ice-house, which every winter
                    is replenished<lb/> by some of his neighbours, for the privilege<lb/> of
                    supplying themselves in the summer. I noticed<lb/> that the two female servants
                    employed in the fa-<lb/> mily, had, both of them, been lately hired from on<lb/>
                    board a vessel lying in the Delaware; and which<lb/> had recently arrived from
                    Amsterdam with several<lb/> hundred Germans, men, women, and children, of<lb/>
                    that description of people called, in America, Re-<lb/> demptioners. These are
                    people in low circum-<lb/>
                    <pb n="33" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_033"/>stances, who, being desirous of settling in America,<lb/> and not
                    having money to pay their passage, agree<lb/> with the American captains of
                    vessels to be taken<lb/> over on condition of hiring for a term of years,
                    on<lb/> their arrival in America, to masters who are willing<lb/> to advance 10
                    or 12 guineas to be deducted out of<lb/> their wages; and it not unfrequently
                    happens that<lb/> they agree to serve two, three, or four years for<lb/> meat
                    and clothes only, on condition of their pas-<lb/> sage being paid. Yet, as
                    wages, in the general,<lb/> are rather high in America, it will easily be
                    sup-<lb/> posed that an active and clever person, conversant in<lb/> some
                    business, will make much better terms on<lb/> landing, than the old and infirm;
                    or than those who<lb/> come over ignorant of any business. </p>
                <p>The two female servants I have just mentioned<lb/> were both widows; and one of
                    them had two chil-<lb/> dren with her in the family, who were quite young.<lb/>
                    This woman had lost her husband about the time<lb/> of their arrival on the
                    American coast; and the<lb/> husband of the other, being a sea-faring man
                    be-<lb/> longing to Holland, had, as I understood, lost<lb/> his life and
                    property by an English ship of war.<lb/> Although these two females had obtained
                    a settle-<lb/> ment in a country enjoying many privileges beyond<lb/> that which
                    they had left; yet, I think, no feeling<lb/> mind could behold them thus
                    circumstanced,<lb/> placed amongst strangers of whose language they<lb/> were
                    almost wholly ignorant; and habituated to<lb/>
                    <pb n="34" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_034"/> customs very different from those to which they<lb/> had now to
                    conform, without sensations of com-<lb/> passion; and it was very pleasant to me
                    to<lb/> observe that the general deportment of my rela-<lb/> tions towards them
                    was respectful. </p>
                <p>I noticed many families, particularly in <placeName key="penns">Penn-<lb/>
                        sylvania</placeName>, of great respectability both in our<lb/> Society and
                    amongst others, who had themselves<lb/> come over to this country as
                    Redemptioners; or<lb/> were the children of such. And it is remarkable,<lb/>
                    that the German residents in this country, have<lb/> a character for greater
                    industry and stability than<lb/> those of any other nation. </p>
                <p>In the plantation adjoining my relation's, we<lb/> visited a lead mine on the
                    banks of the <geogName key="perkri">Perkio-<lb/>men</geogName>, which was then
                    worked by a Frenchman. He<lb/> invited us to go down into it, where, at the
                    depth<lb/> of about 12 feet, I saw a vein of lead ore 18 inches<lb/> in
                    thickness; and as it is wrought at a very easy<lb/> expense, there was a great
                    probability of its being<lb/> a very valuable acquisition. But these things,
                    like<lb/> many others in the world, have the stamp of great<lb/> uncertainty
                    upon them. </p>

                <p>We returned this day to<lb/>

                    breakfasted. After<lb/> breakfast we crossed the <geogName key="schri"
                        >Schuylkill</geogName>, at <placeName key="sprmill">Spring Mill<lb/>
                            <pb n="35" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_035"/> Ferry</placeName>, and had a sight of a vineyard of about five
                    <lb/>acres, under the management of a Frenchman.<lb/> As the vines were not
                    suffered to grow more than<lb/> three feet in height, it had something the
                    appear-<lb/> ance of a field of raspberries. By the pruning<lb/> down the vines,
                    the fruit, generally, becomes much<lb/> finer than when suffered to spread, as
                    is commonly<lb/> the case in England. This day the thermometer<lb/> stood at 76,
                    in the shade, at two o'clock in the<lb/> afternoon. I believe that we have
                    sometimes as<lb/> hot days in England, during the summer months,<lb/> as are
                    commonly felt in America; but there be-<lb/> ing a much longer continuance of
                    hot weather<lb/> in the latter country, it is, of course, more fa-<lb/> vourable
                    for ripening various kinds of fruit.<lb/> Having been very kindly invited, I
                    dined at<lb/> E. L's, the father of one of our companions on<lb/> the voyage
                    from Liverpool. The generous atten-<lb/> tions I experienced in this family, I
                    trust I shall<lb/> not soon forget. On sitting down to dinner, I<lb/> found

                    a small<lb/> town to a great commercial city. Amongst<lb/> other things, he
                    mentioned to me that he well<lb/> remembered the time when there was but
                    one<lb/> ironmonger's shop in the place; and when there<lb/> was only one ship
                    in the trade between Philadel-<lb/> phia and London; and the arrival of this
                    vessel<lb/> used to be of so much importance, that marriages<lb/> were sometimes
                    delayed until its return. Such is<lb/> the great increase of this city, that it
                    is now said<lb/> to contain 106,000 inhabitants; more than 1000<lb/> families of
                    whom are of our society. </p>

                    for, as yet, little is<lb/> done towards the foundation of a city,
                    excepting<lb/> the public offices, and houses for the accommoda-<lb/> tion of
                    the officers and clerks in the various de-<lb/>
                    <pb n="41" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_041"/>partments of the State, and a few inns and taverns;<lb/> but, as
                    George Town is adjoining to it, they to-<lb/> gether make up a population of
                    about 8000 inha-<lb/> bitants. The capitol will be a noble building<lb/> when
                    finished; and is beautifully situated on a<lb/> commanding eminence; whence
                    every part of the<lb/> city may be seen; and whence also is a fine pro-<lb/>
                    spect of the Navy Yard, and of the Potowmack as<lb/> far down as Alexandria;
                    being a distance of 6 or<lb/> 7 miles. Upon the whole, the situation is one
                    of<lb/> the most eligible spots for a city that I have ever<lb/> seen; and the
                    plan being deliberately drawn out,<lb/> and every thing done with regularity and

                    and regularly built cities in the world;<lb/> and, what is of more consequence,
                    the situation is<lb/> dry and healthy. To a contemplative mind, there<lb/> is
                    something very interesting in the consideration<lb/> of the representatives of
                    an extensive empire, like<lb/> that of the United States, thus jointly
                    fixing<lb/> upon the most eligible situation for their chief<lb/> city. </p>

                    <placeName key="alexa">Alexandria</placeName>, a beautiful little city, situated
                    on that<lb/> river, at a spot where it is about one mile over,<lb/> and so deep
                    that ships of war ride at anchor<lb/> before the town. </p>
                <pb n="42" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_042"/>
                <p>A worthy friend, of this city, mentioned to me<lb/> a remarkable preservation
                    experienced there during<lb/> the war. While the town was in the hands of the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="usag">American Government</orgName>, the English Commander
                    had,<lb/> for some reason, given orders to burn it; and a ship<lb/> of war,
                    containing every requisite for its destruction,<lb/> was ordered up the
                    Potowmack. This inhabitants,<lb/> as well may be conceived, were in the utmost
                    con-<lb/> sternation; but, at the moment when they were in<lb/> the greatest
                    confusion and distress; whilst the ship<lb/> was steadily making her way within
                    sight of the<lb/> town, and all was given up for lost, there being<lb/> no
                    prospect of help, at this critical moment, the<lb/> ship struck upon a sandbank,
                    where she remained<lb/> immoveable. The town was thus providentially<lb/> saved
                    from destruction, by that All-powerful arm,<lb/> which so often interposes in
                    the affairs of men;<lb/> sometimes bringing down those who by a series<lb/> of
                    success seem to think themselves out of<lb/> the reach of accident; and
                    sometimes raising up<lb/> others who by a long train of adversity had<lb/>
                    thought themselves below hope. </p>

                <p>I lodged last night at <placeName key="alexa">Alexan-<lb/> dria</placeName>. Soon
                    after I fell asleep, I was suddenly<lb/> waked by the noise of a number of
                    horns. It ap-<lb/> peared to me that the instruments used were cow-<lb/> horns;
                    and they made a prodigious bellowing in<lb/> the dead of the night. On inquiring
                    I found that<lb/> it was the constant practice of the watchmen of<lb/><pb n="43"
                        facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_043"/> this city, on meeting, to take their rounds, to<lb/> serenade the citizens
                    with a loud blast from their<lb/> horns, which they carry with them, and which
                    are<lb/> used for the same purpose as the watchmen's rat-<lb/>tles in England.
                    This morning, in company with<lb/> two friends, I crossed the <geogName
                        key="potor">Potowmack</geogName>, and paid a<lb/> visit to a family at N --.
                    This family, consist-<lb/> ing chiefly of females, were born at Wickersly,<lb/>
                    near Rotheram. Their mother was of a family<lb/> near Settle who are of the
                    Roman Catholic per-<lb/>suasion. The family came over early in the set-<lb/>
                    tlement of Maryland by Lord Baltimore; and the<lb/> bricks of which the house is
                    built, they informed<lb/> me were brought over in the same ship with their<lb/>
                    progenitors. The house is constructed upon the<lb/> plan of some of our old
                    English mansions; and the<lb/> garden is laid out in the old English style. It
                    is<lb/> remarkable that I have never yet seen a garden, in<lb/> America, walled
                    round as in England. I believe<lb/> that one principal reason is the warmth of
                    the cli-<lb/>mate, and the clear, fine atmosphere, which pre-<lb/> clude the use
                    of fruit walls. Besides, walls would<lb/> obstruct the free current of air,
                    whiclh would be an<lb/> objection to them. Yet I have frequently seen<lb/>
                    gardens handsomely fenced round to the height of<lb/> 6 or 7 feet, with neatly
                    planed boards, painted<lb/> white or green. It abated greatly the pleasure
                    I<lb/> should have received from the hospitality of this<lb/> family, when I was
                    informed that they were in<lb/> possession of upwards of one hundred
                    Negro<lb/><pb n="44" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_044"/> slaves; numbers of whom I saw at work in the<lb/>
                    fields, the garden, and about the house. They<lb/> appeared to be a remarkably
                    stout, robust race of<lb/> men, and, in point of health, had, to all
                    appear-<lb/> ance, greatly the advantage of their owners. A<lb/> person, not
                    conversant with these things, would be<lb/> naturally led to think, that where
                    families have the<lb/> opportunity of employing a number of slaves,<lb/> every
                    thing about their houses, gardens, and plan-<lb/>tations, would be kept in very
                    nice order. How-<lb/> ever, the reverse of this is generally the case; and<lb/>
                    I was sometimes ready to think that the more<lb/> slaves there were employed
                    about a house and<lb/> plantation, the more disorder appeared. I am<lb/>
                    persuaded, that in a well-regulated family, with<lb/> one or two hired servants,
                    much more neatness,<lb/> order, and comfort may be preserved, than can be<lb/>
                    maintained by treble the number of slaves. I have<lb/> been in families where
                    several slaves were kept<lb/> which have scarcely afforded the common
                    neces-<lb/>saries of life. I have sat at table in families where<lb/> two or
                    three slaves have waited upon us, and yet<lb/> there has not been a lodging-room
                    or accommoda-<lb/>tions at night, equal to what many a labouring man<lb/> in
                    England is able to furnish; and, to compare the<lb/> accommodations of a
                    slave-holder, in some of the<lb/> Southern States, with what the meanest of
                    the<lb/> Pennsylvanian farmers are accustomed to, would<lb/> be still more
                    unfavourable to the former. </p>

                <p>After attending to some busi-<lb/> ness, P. J. and several other friends joining
                    us, we<lb/> took a boat with an intention of visiting <placeName key="mtver"
                        >Mount<lb/> Vernon</placeName>; but, after sailing a few miles on the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="potor">Potowmack</geogName>, the wind got up very high, and<lb/>
                    we found it would be unsafe to land: so, after<lb/> taking a view of that
                    beautiful spot from the river,<lb/> we found it most prudent to return. Before
                    we<lb/> had got half way back to <placeName key="alexa">Alexandria</placeName>,
                    the wind<lb/> still increasing, a great part of our company pre-<lb/>ferred
                    walking 7 or 8 miles in the heat of the day,<lb/> to the danger of continuing
                    their voyage on the<lb/> river; and they were accordingly put on shore at<lb/>
                    the first convenient landing. On approaching the<lb/> shore, I was entertained
                    with the sight of a num-<lb/> ber of beautiful tortoises, that were seated
                    upon<lb/> the edge of a large boat which lay a wreck at the<lb/> water side.
                    Their colours were as beautifully<lb/> variegated as the wings of the butterfly.
                    After<lb/> landing a part of our company, we beat up the<lb/> river in the best
                    manner we could: and, had I not<lb/> been a pretty good swimmer, I should
                    frequently<lb/> have considered myself in extreme danger; but<lb/> knowing that
                    if the boat had filled with water, I<lb/> was able to swim on shore, I had not
                    much fear<lb/> about me. </p>

                <p>I attended <orgName key="meetalex">Alexandria monthly<lb/> meeting</orgName> in
                    the forenoon; and, there being a vessel<lb/> lying here, which was about sailing

                    <pb n="46" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_046"/> I wrote and forwarded several letters to my rela-<lb/> tives in
                    England. Although the atmosphere on<lb/> the continent is in general very clear;
                    yet I could<lb/> not avoid noticing, that, in this part of America,<lb/> it was
                    still clearer than in in any place I had before<lb/> seen. The stars seemed to
                    glitter with a brilliancy<lb/> exceeding any thing I had already been
                    witness<lb/> to. So great was their lustre, that, waking about<lb/> midnight,
                    and observing a considerable degree of<lb/> light shining into the chamber, at
                    first, I thought<lb/> it might be from the moon; but, on recollection,<lb/> I
                    knew this could not be the case, and looking<lb/> out at the window, I found the
                    light proceeded<lb/> from several brilliant stars, which shone with such<lb/>
                    brightness as to cause the shadow of any inter-<lb/> vening object, much in the
                    same manner as the<lb/> moon. The inn I slept at, is kept by an English-<lb/>
                    man of the name of Gadsley, and is conducted in<lb/> a manner much superior to
                    most inns in this coun-<lb/> try, or many in England. Every thing was pre-<lb/>
                    served neat and clean, with good beds, and not<lb/> more than one or two in a
                    chamber. </p>

                <p>I left <placeName key="alexa">Alex-<lb/> andria</placeName>, crossed the
                        <geogName key="potor">Potowmack</geogName>, and went down<lb/> to <placeName

                    <placeName key="pisca">Piscattaway</placeName>, where I dined, and where,
                    amongst<lb/> other things, broiled squirrels were served up at<lb/> table. In
                    travelling along this day, I observed<lb/> that the population of this part of
                    the country<lb/> consisted chiefly of black people; and, in many<lb/> parts of
                    the road, I noticed it was mostly tracked<lb/> with the bare feet, some of which
                    appeared to<lb/> be immoderately large, arising, probably, from<lb/> their
                    almost constant practice of going barefoot.<lb/> In many places I had an
                    opportunity of seeing the<lb/> farmers busily employed in treading out the
                    grain<lb/> in the open fields, with their horses. These were<lb/> mounted with
                    several negro boys, who continued<lb/> riding round and round in a circle, in
                    which the<lb/> sheaves were spread. At the same time, a num<lb/> ber of negro
                    men were employed in casting off<lb/> the straw, when the grain was trodden out,
                    and<lb/> replacing it with fresh sheaves. Sometimes I have<lb/> seen ten or
                    twelve horses go round in one circle;<lb/> one negro boy having the care of two
                    or three<lb/> horses. </p>

                <p>In passing by the public<lb/> grave-yard at Port-Tobacco, I observed on one<lb/>
                    of tile grave stones, the name of Gray inscribed,<lb/> with the addition that he
                    was a native of the parish<lb/> of Sheffield. </p>

                <p>In travelling along the road,<lb/> I was a little entertained with several
                    parties of<lb/> females riding to their places of worship; some<lb/> of whom
                    were escorted by a negro boy who rode<lb/> behind one of the girls. On coming to
                    a gate, or<lb/> any other impediment, the negro jumps nimbly off<lb/> the horse,
                    and, after rendering the service required,<lb/> as nimbly runs after his
                    mistress and again resumes<lb/> his seat, without any detention of the party. </p>
                <p>Yesterday I visited <persName key="ware1">Colonel Ware</persName>, at his
                    habi-<lb/>tation, by whom I was kindly treated. Many<lb/> habitations in this
                    part of the country are exceed-<lb/> ingly private and retired; and the
                    situations of<lb/> some of them beautiful beyond description; but<lb/> that
                    cruel system of negro slavery, seems to hang<lb/> like a dark cloud over all
                    their pleasant scenes. In<lb/> the afternoon of this day, I returned to
                        <placeName key="alexa">Alexandria</placeName>,<lb/> and, in crossing the
                        <geogName key="potor">Potomack</geogName>, was ferried over<lb/> by two
                    negro slaves, who gave me in account of<lb/> two of their fellow slaves being
                    drowned, in cross-<lb/>ing this ferry during the last winter, at a time<lb/>
                    when large quantities of ice were floating down the<lb/> stream, which overset
                    the boat. I believe, it some-<lb/>
                    <pb n="49" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_049"/>times happens, that these poor creatures are very<lb/> unnecessarily
                    exposed to dangers, when they dare<lb/> not remonstrate with their owners. </p>
                <p>Arriving at <placeName key="alexa">Alexandria</placeName> in time, I attended
                    their<lb/> afternoon <orgName key="meetalex">meeting</orgName>, and dined with
                    W. P. a valu-<lb/>able old customer; and afterwards supped and<lb/> spent the

                    the house of a hospitable person of the<lb/> name of J. C. who, though not a
                    member of our<lb/> society, has a regard for friends and their prin-<lb/>
                    ciples. In some conversation I had with him, he<lb/> told me that he came over
                    to America with his<lb/> parents, in early life, from Ireland; and being
                    soon<lb/> left an orphan, had many difficulties and dis-<lb/> couragements to
                    surmount; but that he had been<lb/> favoured to establish himself here. I found
                    he<lb/> was considered by his neighbours, as a man of re-<lb/> spectability; and
                    by many of them was supposed to<lb/> be a member of our society. Although
                    convinced<lb/> of the truth of our principles, yet I believe he has<lb/> never
                    applied to be received as a member; and<lb/> being at a considerably distance
                    from any meeting<lb/> of friends, and having but little of their society,<lb/>
                    except the transient call of such as may be travel-<lb/> ling that way, it is
                    probable he never may apply. </p>

                <p>I pursued my way to <placeName key="richm">Rich-<lb/> mond</placeName> in the
                    mail stage, through a beautiful coun-<lb/> try, but clouded and debased by Negro
                    slavery. At<lb/> the house where I breakfasted, which is called the<lb/>
                    Bowling-green, I was told that the Owner had in his<lb/> possession 200 slaves.
                    In one field near the house,<lb/> planted with tobacco, I counted nearly 20
                    women<lb/> and children, employed in picking grubs from the<lb/> plant. In the
                    afternoon I passed by a field in<lb/> which several poor slaves had lately been
                    executed,<lb/> on the charge of having an intention to rise against<lb/> their
                    masters. A lawyer who was present at their<lb/> trials at Richmond, informed me
                    that on one<lb/> of them being asked, what he had to say to the<lb/> court on
                    his defence, he replied, in a manly tone of<lb/> voice: <said who="undetermined"
                        >I have nothing more to offer than what<lb/> General Washington would have
                        had to offer, had<lb/> he been taken by the British and put to trial by<lb/>
                        them. I have adventured my life in endeavouring<lb/> to obtain the liberty
                        of my countrymen, and am a<lb/> willing sacrifice in their cause and I beg,
                        as a fa-<lb/> vour, that I may be immediately led to execution.<lb/> I know
                        that you have pre-determined to shed my<lb/> blood, why then all this

                </p>
                <p>In the evening I arrived at <placeName key="richm">Richmond</placeName>, the
                    capi-<lb/>tal of Virginia. In one respect, this has a good<lb/> deal the

                    occasioned by the<lb/> use of pit-coal. They have great plenty of this<lb/>
                    <pb n="51" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_051"/> article in the neighbourhood, a considerable quan-<lb/> tity of
                    which they ship to other parts of the United<lb/> States. There is also a
                    navigable canal for the<lb/> conveyance of coal, on which a great deal of
                    busi-<lb/> ness is done, and the canal appears to be as well<lb/> managed as
                    those in England.</p>

                <p>Having business with C. A. of<lb/> Gouchland, at a distance of about 30 miles on

                    cultivated<lb/> by negro slaves, many of whom dwell in small<lb/> clusters of
                    huts at no great distance from their<lb/> master's house, I had the curiosity to
                    look into<lb/> some of their little habitations; but all that I exa-<lb/> mined
                    were wretched in the extreme, and far<lb/> inferior to many Indian cottages I

                <p>I slept at C. A's, and this<lb/> morning set out for <placeName key="frede1"

                    we dined, we were waited on by two<lb/> mullatto girls, whose only clothing
                    appeared to<lb/>
                    <pb n="52" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_052"/> be loose garments of cotton and woollen cloths,<lb/> girt round the
                    waist with a small cord. I had ob-<lb/>served that this was a common dress of

                    business in the house it seemed hardly sufficient<lb/> to cover them. In the

                    still,<lb/> employed in making spirits from cider. Here<lb/> again I had the
                    curiosity to look into some of the<lb/> Negro huts, which like those I had

                    along, I saw several plantations of cotton, in some<lb/> of which the negro
                    children were gathering the wool.<lb/> In the afternoon, as our road lay through

                    and attended by<lb/> several gaily dressed footmen: a sight not very<lb/> common
                    in the back woods of this country. The<lb/> evening coming on, and no inn being
                    near, we<lb/> took up our quarters at the house of a planter of<lb/> the name of
                    Holiday, where we were well accom-<lb/>modated. </p>

                <p>We came to <placeName key="frede1">Fredericksburg</placeName><lb/> and lodged at
                        <placeName key="fishe">Fisher's Tavern</placeName>. The next morning,<lb/> I
                    was waked early by the cries of a poor Negro,<lb/> who was undergoing a severe
                    correction, previously<lb/> to his going to York. On taking a walk on the<lb/>
                    banks of the <geogName key="rappa">Rappahannock</geogName>, the river on which<lb/>
                    <pb n="53" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_053"/> this town is seated, I stepped into one of the large<lb/> tobacco
                    warehouses which are built here, for the<lb/> reception and inspection of that
                    plant, before it is<lb/> permitted to be exported. On entering into con-<lb/>
                    versation with an inspector, as he was employed in<lb/> looking over a parcel of
                    tobacco, he lamented the<lb/> licenciousness which he remarked so generally<lb/>
                    prevailed in this town. He said, that in his remem-<lb/> brance, the principal
                    part of the inhabitants were<lb/> emigrants from Scotland, and that it was
                    consi-<lb/> dered so reproachful to the white inhabitants, if<lb/> they were
                    found to have an illicit connection with<lb/> their female slaves, that their
                    neighbours would<lb/> shun the company of such, as of persons with<lb/> whom it
                    was a reproach to be acquainted. The<lb/> case was now so much altered that, he
                    believed,<lb/> there were but few slave holders in the place who<lb/> were free
                    from guilt in this respect: and that it<lb/> was now thought but little of. Such
                    was the bru-<lb/> tality and hardness of heart which this evil pro-<lb/> duced,
                    that some amongst them paid no more<lb/> regard to selling their own children,
                    by their<lb/> female slaves, or even their brothers and sisters, in<lb/> the
                    same line, than they would do to the disposal<lb/> of a cow or a horse, or any
                    other property in the<lb/> brute creation. To so low a degree of degrada-<lb/>
                    tion does the system of negro slavery sink the white<lb/> inhabitants, who are
                    unhappily engaged in it.</p>

                <p>Having paid my fare last<lb/> night to go in the mail stage to <placeName

                    the stage; but the circumstance of my lodging<lb/> at another inn, on account of
                    the vermin with<lb/> which I had been annoyed when I last slept at the<lb/>
                    --Tavern, had so displeased the man, that<lb/> he had sent out the stage
                    considerably before the<lb/> usual time, in order that I might he
                    disappointed<lb/> of getting to Alexandria this day. As I stood at<lb/> the door
                    of the Tavern, remonstrating with the<lb/> landlord on account of his mean and
                    unkind con-<lb/>duct in treating me thus, J. C. rode up to us on<lb/> an
                    excellent horse of his own; and, as soon as he<lb/> understood how the landlord
                    had behaved to me,<lb/> he immediately dismounted and insisted upon my<lb/>
                    pursuing my journey upon his horse. I accord-<lb/> ingly accepted his generous
                    offer, but, before I<lb/> set out, I complained to the post-maste, who re-<lb/>
                    turned the money I had paid at the Tavern, and,<lb/> at the same time declared,
                    that if ever he again<lb/> detected the landlord in the like base conduct
                    to<lb/> any traveller, he would remove the mail stage<lb/> to another inn. The
                    circumstance of pursuing my<lb/> journey on horseback, afforded me an

                    the habitation of the<lb/> late General Washington; and I was shown through<lb/>

                <p>I set out for <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, in<lb/> company with

                    <pb n="56" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_056"/> the General of that name. With this person I<lb/> had some
                    acquaintance, having met with him be-<lb/> fore. In travelling along, he gave me
                    a little<lb/> account of a visit he paid to Paris, at the time of<lb/> the
                    Revolution. Amongst other things, he men-<lb/> tioned to me the extreme
                    indifference with which<lb/> many poor men paid the forfeit of their lives,<lb/>
                    during that awful period. At one time he accom-<lb/>panied the American

                    victims, as<lb/> they were about to be executed; and where he was<lb/> so near
                    that he could hear their conversation; which<lb/> was as light and frivolous as
                    of men engaged in<lb/> the common or ordinary concerns of life. One of<lb/> them
                    remarked to his companion, that he would<lb/> take care that he would have
                    nothing to do with<lb/> Revolutions in the next world, seeing he had met<lb/>
                    with so poor a reward in this.</p>
                <p>Several of our companions in the stage were<lb/> French people, and amongst them
                    a Catholic<lb/> priest. There was something singular in this<lb/> man's conduct
                    and conversation. Sometimes he<lb/> appeared very devoutly reading a book of
                    devo-<lb/>tion; and, in a moment, he would shut up his book<lb/> and begin
                    singing with the greatest gaity, and<lb/> talking nonsense to his female
                    companions. In<lb/> the afternoon I arrived at <placeName key="balti"

                    difficulty in<lb/> getting along, on account of a great number of<lb/> large
                    trees which were blown down and laid across<lb/> the road. However we got safe

                    along, they be-<lb/> came one of course. I observed one passenger to<lb/> be a

                    the conduct of<lb/> friends who were active in the cause of the Negroes.<lb/>
                    Amongst other things, he remarked that there was<lb/> a tailor in Philadelphia,
                    a Quaker, of the name<lb/> of -- --, whose work-board being at a front<lb/>
                    window, he had an opportunity of noticing the pas-<lb/> sengers in the street;
                    and that whenever he saw a<lb/> Negro whom he judged to be a runaway slave,
                    he<lb/> would, in a moment, jump from his work-board<lb/> and run into the
                    street. If he found the Negro to<lb/> be really a runaway, he would take him
                    under his<lb/> protection, and send him to some settlement in the<lb/> back
                    parts of Pennsylvania, where he would be<lb/> sure to find employment; and thus
                    he went on<lb/> from day to day, in what the slave merchant<lb/> considered no
                    better than highway robbery. The<lb/> man who was making these observations, I
                    found<lb/> had been in that trade; and that T. H. was the friend<lb/> who had
                    with much propriety been a father to<lb/> the oppressed Negroes. </p>

                    romantic and beautiful, and is one amongst<lb/> the many pleasand spots I have
                    seen in this coun-<lb/> try. Indeed the town of <placeName key="wilmi"

                    the road being through a pleasant country,<lb/> diversified with hill and dale,

                    sight<lb/> of several fields of Indian corn, the crops on which<lb/> were finer
                    than any I had ever before seen. On<lb/> inquiry, I found they belonged to an
                    innkeeper, who<lb/> had manured them well. From various observa-<lb/> tions I
                    have made, I have no doubt that the land<lb/>
                    <pb n="61" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_061"/> in this country, generally speaking, would, when<lb/> plentifully
                    manured, yield much greater crops than<lb/> can commonly be obtained in England;
                    chiefly<lb/> owing to their summer, or season of vegetation<lb/> continuing a
                    greater length of time than with us.<lb/> In the evening I arrived at <placeName

                <p>This being the first day of<lb/> the week, I attended meeting; and, in the
                    after-<lb/>noon was at the burial of S. E. who had been a<lb/> friend and
                    customer of mine some years. The uncer-<lb/> tainty of life, and the fluctuating
                    state of things in<lb/> the world, were seldom more fully exemplified than<lb/>
                    in the case of this young man. Few men have pur-<lb/> sued business with more
                    reputation and success<lb/> than he had done; so that, in a few years, he
                    had<lb/> honourably acquired a very large property; and,<lb/> only a very few
                    weeks before, was united to an ami-<lb/>able young woman, to whom he had for
                    some time<lb/> been sincerely attached. At this moment, when<lb/> everything on
                    earth seemed to smile around him,<lb/> and there was every prospect of many
                    years of<lb/> happiness, a blight was brought over all, in an<lb/> unexpected
                    and awful way. He was suddenly<lb/> deprived of reason, and, after a few weeks
                    con-<lb/>finement, departed this life, leaving a mournful,<lb/> although
                    instructive lesson of the mutability of all<lb/> earthly enjoyments. Having
                    received an invitation<lb/> from my countryman T. S. I supped and spent the<lb/>
                    evening at his house. </p>

                <p>I was employed in<lb/> business; and having an opportunity, by a vessel<lb/>
                    which was ready for sailing, I wrote to my family.<lb/> The next day I spent an
                    hour or two in Doctor<lb/> R.'s family. The Doctor, although advanced in<lb/>
                    years, is still very active in business; and his wife,<lb/> who is an elderly
                    woman, continues to be very<lb/> active in her family. I found them amidst a
                    nu-<lb/>merous group of promising children; some of<lb/> whom are arrived at
                    years of maturity. The con-<lb/>versation I had with the Doctor was
                    interesting,<lb/> he having been intimately acquainted with many<lb/> of the
                    leading characters in the Revolution, par-<lb/>ticularly with General
                    Washington, and the Presi-<lb/> dent, <persName key="tjeff2">T.
                        Jefferson</persName>. As Doctor R. had constantly<lb/> been a warm advocate
                    for the abolition of Negro<lb/> slavery, he sometimes endeavoured to
                    introduce<lb/> the subject in conversation with the General; but<lb/> always
                    found him extremely backward at saying<lb/> any thing on these occasions, as if
                    conscious of the<lb/> cruelty of the practice, although he was deeply
                    in-<lb/>volved in it. Though a man of great character<lb/> and talents in many
                    respects, yet the detention of<lb/> his Negro slaves in bondage during his life,
                    will<lb/> always be a shade to his virtues. Yet it is but<lb/> justice to notice
                    that, by will, he provided for the<lb/> liberation of his slaves, who in course
                    became free-<lb/>men at his death. </p>

                <p>I supped and spent the even-<lb/> ing at S. S.'s, where a sister of John
                    Pemberton's<lb/> widow was present. She informed me, that her<lb/> father was
                    frequently in the practice of entertain-<lb/>ing different parties of Indians,
                    who came to <placeName key="phila">Phi-<lb/>ladelphia</placeName> on public
                    business; and that having once<lb/>
                    <pb n="64" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_064"/> invited a number of chiefs, who were then in the<lb/> city, to
                    breakfast, they came to the house rather<lb/> earlier than the servants
                    expected, accompanied by<lb/> their interpreter. However they were
                    introduced<lb/> into the breakfast room, where a servant was en-<lb/>gaged in
                    brightening up some of the brass work<lb/> about the fire-place, and were
                    desired to sit down<lb/> until her master made his appearance. They had<lb/> not
                    sat long, before one of the Indians made an<lb/> observation in his own
                    language, which the inter-<lb/>preter was desired to put into English; but this
                    he<lb/> objected to, alledging that what the Indian had<lb/> said was a matter
                    of indifference, and not worth<lb/> repeating. On being closely pressed to keep
                    back<lb/> nothing the Indians might say, as every thing from<lb/> them would be
                    interesting, he complied, and said<lb/> that the remark which the Indian made
                    was this:<lb/>
                    <q>Look,</q> said he to his fellow Indians, <q>at that ser-<lb/>vant, how she
                        labours at those andirons. I dare say,<lb/> if we had come yesterday, we
                        should have found her<lb/> at the same employment; and if we come to-<lb/>
                        morrow morning it is ten to one but we shall still<lb/> find her at the same
                        work. How foolish these<lb/> white people are! thus to labour and toil
                        about<lb/> things which can answer no good purpose; cer-<lb/>tainly these
                        white people must be fools!</q> Thus<lb/> the Indians judge the civilized
                    part of the world;<lb/> and what is called the civilized world, is not
                    behind<lb/> in judging the Indians; so apt are we to judge<lb/> one another.</p>

                <p>In conversation with a friend<lb/> of the name of R. W. he informed me that, in
                    the<lb/> early part of his life, he was on the island of the<lb/> Havanna, where
                    he had some considerable business<lb/> to transact; but being ignorant of the
                    Spanish<lb/> language, an Irish Roman Catholic Priest kindly<lb/> lent him his
                    assistance on various occasions; and,<lb/> so effectually, that the Priest was
                    the means of his<lb/> acquiring a large property, during a short stay<lb/>
                    there. At the time of parting with this friendly<lb/> Priest, he presented him
                    with a purse of one<lb/> thousand dollars, as a small compensation for the<lb/>
                    assistance he had received; but the truly Catholic<lb/> Priest declared, that he
                    would not accept of any<lb/> compensation of this sort; adding, <said>All I ask
                        of<lb/> you, in return for any service I may have rendered<lb/> you, is,
                        that if, at and future period, you happen to<lb/> meet a countryman of mine
                        in need of assistance,<lb/> you would do to him as I have done to
                        you.</said><lb/> This affords one amongst many proofs, that the<lb/> truly

                <p>This day was remarkably cold,<lb/> far beyond any thing I had ever experienced

                    other in great numbers; chiefly<lb/> with fire wood from the Jersey shore.
                    Exclusive<lb/> of these, parties of pleasure were seen driving along<lb/> in

                    <pb n="67" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_067"/> it are some sand banks which are seen at low<lb/> water. These
                    circumstances produce a very singu-<lb/>lar and romantic appearance, by the
                    large sheets of<lb/> ice being obstructed and accumulated in various<lb/> parts
                    of the river, having the resemblance of large<lb/> blocks of white marble piled
                    on heaps. There<lb/> being a constant intercourse between the two<lb/> shores of
                        <geogName key="delaw">the Delaware</geogName>, it is curious to observe<lb/>
                    the various means which the owners of the ferry<lb/> boats use, to counteract
                    the effects of the frost, on<lb/> its first setting in, so as to preserve the
                    commu-<lb/>nication open. On these occasions they make use<lb/> of a boat that
                    has two sliders, one on each side<lb/> the keel, shod with iron; and, as the
                    shallow parts<lb/> of the river are first frozen, they sail as usual over<lb/>
                    the deep parts, and on coming to those which<lb/> are frozen, they drag the boat
                    out of the water,<lb/> and push it along the ice, until they come to the<lb/>
                    deep places, when the boat is again plunged<lb/> into the water. Thus they go on
                    till they reach<lb/> the opposite shore; and as it will, in course,<lb/>
                    sometimes happen, in the early part of the frost,<lb/> that between the ice and
                    the shallow water, the<lb/> ice is not sufficiently strong to support the

                    iron bound shoes,<lb/> and, with a long pole in his hands. With these<lb/> he
                    labours with all his might, to break the ice, and<lb/> make way for the
                    boat.</p>

                    come from various parts of the continent of<lb/> Europe. They appear thankful
                    for the encourage-<lb/>ment and protection they meet with in this favoured<lb/>

                <p>I spent this afternoon at<lb/> J. D.'s, a friend who, some years past, came
                    from<lb/> the neighbourhood of Darlington, with his wife<lb/> and family. There
                    is something so remarkable in<lb/> the circumstances of his leaving England,
                    that I am<lb/> tempted to give them as related from his own mouth.<lb/> He being
                    a merchant of great respectability and<lb/> liberality, who by industry has
                    realized a large pro-<lb/>perty, I believe they may be relied on. For some<lb/>
                    time before he left England, his thoughts had been<lb/> turned towards
                    Pennsylvania; but before he had<lb/> come to any fixed resolution, he dreamed
                    that he<lb/> had met with a friend, from that country, who was<lb/> able to give
                    him every necessary information on<lb/> the subject. A short time after this
                    dream he<lb/> came accidentally to Darlington, where he saw a<lb/>
                    <pb n="69" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_069"/> person in the street, who exactly resembled the<lb/> friend he had
                    seen in his dream. He accordingly<lb/> applied to him, and found the individual
                    he was<lb/> speaking to, was <persName key="jpemb2">John Pemberton</persName>,
                    of Philadelphia,<lb/> who was at that time on a religious visit to Great<lb/>
                    Britain. Having received what information he<lb/> thought necessary, he made
                    arrangements for his<lb/> voyage to America, and, with his wife and
                    children,<lb/> took a final leave of England.</p>

                <p>The frost still continuing very<lb/> intense, the use of wheel carriages was in a

                    fitted to their harness, that passengers in the streets<lb/> may have notice of

                <p>The frost<lb/> still continuing very severe, I made frequent ex-<lb/>cursions
                    upon the ice of <geogName key="delaw">the Delaware</geogName>, where a<lb/>
                    great many ships lay bound fast by the frost. One<lb/>
                    <pb n="71" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_071"/> very large vessel, I noticed, called the Connecti-<lb/>cut, which
                    had now been fast near one month,<lb/> with her whole complement of hands on
                    board;<lb/> being nearly one hundred in number. This ship<lb/> was intended for
                    a Voyage to Domingo, and was<lb/> completely armed as a regular vessel of war.
                    As<lb/> most of the men had received part of their wages<lb/> in advance, and
                    the owners were fearful they might<lb/> take advantage of the ship being thus
                    detained<lb/> and leave her, they had fixed a strong net work<lb/> all round
                    her, reaching from the beam, nearly as<lb/> high as the yards. The crew being
                    thus inclosed,<lb/> had the appearance of a flock of birds in a cage.<lb/> This
                    kind of net work is sometimes made use of<lb/> in time of action to prevent
                    being boarded by the<lb/> enemy. </p>
                <p>The Negroes in the island of Domingo, having<lb/> thrown off the French yoke and
                    set up an Em-<lb/>peror of their own colour, the French Government<lb/> had, in
                    consequence declared them rebels; and,<lb/> having prohibited all intercourse
                    with them, this<lb/> circumstance occasioned the Americans to arm<lb/> their
                    ships which traded to that island. About<lb/> this time <persName key="jpemb1"
                        >James Pemberton</persName> sent a number of<lb/> friend's books to the

                    James<lb/> received a reply and acknowledgement, written in<lb/> a very singular
                    style; the substance of the reply was,<lb/> as I understood it, that he was
                    obliged to him for the<lb/>
                    <pb n="72" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_072"/> books; but that he was determined to be Emperor<lb/> of Haiti, (the

                    Not-<lb/>withstanding this determination, he has since been<lb/> cut off by his

                    disowned. During<lb/> the time of his separation, he had married an<lb/> amiable
                    young woman, who was convinced of the<lb/> truth of friends' principles, and
                    joined the society.<lb/> The impression made upon the meeting, on his<lb/>
                    presenting an acknowledgement, was such, that<lb/> he was reinstated in the

                    who, during the war<lb/> with England, gave friends a great deal of

                <p>This afternoon at B. J.'s, one<lb/> of our company was a young woman who was<lb/>
                    there on a visit. Her usual residence was in one<lb/> of the new settlements, on
                    the banks of the Ohio,<lb/> about 500 miles from Philadelphia. She informed<lb/>
                    us that many families on the banks of this great<lb/> river, are supplied with
                    shop goods from vessels<lb/> which navigate it, and are fitted up with
                    counters,<lb/> shelves, and drawers, in the same manner as are<lb/> shops on
                    land, and well stored with all kinds of<lb/> goods. As they sail along the
                    river, on coming near<lb/> a plantation, they blow a horn or conch shell,
                    to<lb/> give notice of their arrival; then the planters, with<lb/> their wives
                    and daughters, repair to these floating<lb/>
                    <pb n="75" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_075"/> shops, and select such things as they are in want<lb/> of; and make
                    payment in the produce of their<lb/> plantations; such as grain, flour, cotton,
                    tobacco,<lb/> dried venison, the skins of wild animals, &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/> The
                    shopkeeper having disposed of his goods in<lb/> this way, returns home with the
                    produce he has<lb/> collected, and again renews his stock, and pro-<lb/> ceeds
                    on another voyage. The young woman re-<lb/>marked, that four or five of these
                    floating shops<lb/> have passed by her father's house, in the course of<lb/> a
                    day. </p>
                <p>She likewise informed us, such was the primitive<lb/> simplicity in which they
                    lived, that it was a very<lb/> unusual thing to have locks on their doors;
                    and<lb/> that when more strangers called upon them, than<lb/> they had beds to
                    accommodate them with, it was<lb/> customary for the family to spread
                    temporary<lb/> beds upon the floor, on which they passed the<lb/> night, leaving
                    their own to the strangers. Yet,<lb/> notwithstanding the homely fare of some of
                    the<lb/> back settlers, luxury is making rapid strides amongst<lb/> them; so
                    that many of the most costly manufactures<lb/> of Europe and Asia, begin to find
                    a ready sale in<lb/> some of their infant towns and cities; and several<lb/>
                    extensive manufactories are already established at<lb/> Pittsburgh and in the
                    neighbourhood; where<lb/> coals are cheaper and more plentiful than in Eng-<lb/>
                    land. In some places the mountain side presents<lb/> a front of coal, as our
                    rocks of stone in England.</p>

                <p>I dined at the house of a<lb/> friend, a native of Bermudas. In the course
                    of<lb/> conversation he informed me, that his business<lb/> having led him to
                    St. Eustatia, he was there at the<lb/> time that island was captured by Admiral
                    Rodney;<lb/> and was witness to many transactions consequent<lb/> on the capture
                    of such an island; which, like<lb/> every other effect of war, produced great

                <p>After about three months con-<lb/> tinuance the frost broke up, which was such as
                    had<lb/> not been felt for the last 40 years, and during which<lb/> even the
                    largest rivers were so frozen, that<lb/> heavy carriages passed offer them
                    daily, as on dry<lb/> land. At one time I had the curiosity to measure<lb/> the

                    the snow and ice were fast dis-<lb/>appearing; and, on taking a ride towards

                    between the owners and<lb/> underwriters of a slave ship. He told me, that<lb/>
                    he was the only survivor out of 380 persons; 350<lb/> of which were slaves. </p>
                <p>We read that a sparrow does not fall to the<lb/> ground without the notice of our
                    heavenly Father.<lb/> How great then must be the responsibility of the<lb/>
                    owners of one of these slave ships, who, in the<lb/> wantonness of power, or the
                    gratification of a base<lb/> and sordid disposition, thus exposes the lives
                    of<lb/> his fellow-creatures to every species of suffering,<lb/> and very
                    frequently, as in the above case, to a<lb/> premature death!</p>
                <p>I recollect once being in conversation with a<lb/> person concerned in the
                    traffic, and who was dis-<lb/>posed to defend it; at length being hard
                    pressed,<lb/> he gave up the point, in a good deal of warmth,<lb/> with this
                    remarkable declaration:-<q>Why, Sir,<lb/>
                        <pb n="79" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_079"/> you can't suppose that the Almighty looks so<lb/> narrowly into

                    about money concerns;<lb/> when it appeared that the national stock had a<lb/>
                    <pb n="84" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_084"/> balance in hand. In the evening I attended the<lb/>

                <p>I attended the tenth and last<lb/> sitting of the yearly meeting. The epistles
                    to<lb/> several yearly meetings were read and agreed to;<lb/> afterwards several
                    female friends were introduced<lb/> from the women's meeting. After a short
                    pause,<lb/> one of them addressed herself to the meeting; but<lb/> more
                    particularly to those employed in husbandry,<lb/> who composed a large part of
                    the body then pres-<lb/>ent. In lively and animated language she re-<lb/>marked
                    to them, that the nature of their employ-<lb/>ment afforded, in a peculiar
                    manner, an opportu-<lb/> nity of observing the wonderful works of the<lb/>
                    creation; but, at the same time, she expressed a<lb/> fear that some of them did
                    not sufficiently, in<lb/> these things, regard the Almighty and Beneficent<lb/>
                    Author of every mercy. In the recollection<lb/> thereof, the words of a pious
                    author recurred<lb/> to her memory, which were descriptive of a mind<lb/> truly
                    alive to tile feelings of gratitude and adora-<lb/>tion to the Great First Cause
                    of all things; and<lb/> are as follows:-</p>
                <quote type="poem">He looks abroad into the varied field<lb/> Of Nature, and th'
                    poor, perhaps, compared<lb/> With those whose mansions glitter in his

                    they not his by a peculiar right,<lb/> And by an emphasis of interest his,<lb/>

                <p>During the time of expressing the above lines,<lb/> an unusual solemnity
                    prevailed; and although a<lb/> very large number of friends were present,
                    which<lb/> might amount to two thousand, yet not the least<lb/> discordant sound
                    was heard. A few the women<lb/> friends had withdrawn, some discussion took
                    place<lb/> relative to the slave trade, in which it was lamented<lb/> that the
                    endeavours of friends and others, had not<lb/> produced the desired effect; but,
                    that it was still<lb/> carried on with rather increasing avidity. Under<lb/>
                    these considerations, friends were called upon in<lb/> the most impressive
                    terms, to remember the<lb/> oppressed Africans, in their supplications at<lb/>
                    the Throne of Mercy; and, under the weight thereof,<lb/> the yearly meeting
                    concluded to general satis-<lb/>faction. </p>

                    relation's W. B. Our time passed on<lb/> very agreeably in traversing his
                    plantation, or<lb/> farm, on the Banks of the <geogName key="schri"
                        >Schuylkill</geogName> and<lb/>
                    <geogName key="perkri">Perkioming</geogName>. The more I see of it, the more
                    I<lb/> am convinced that it is one of the most beautiful<lb/> and healthful
                    situations I have known, either in<lb/> America or in England. The ground rising
                    till it<lb/> becomes elevated high above the banks of the<lb/> rivers, commands
                    a prospect as delightful as can<lb/> well be conceived. A view of some of our
                    No-<lb/>blemen Parks, on the more extensive scale, may<lb/> give a faint idea of
                    the prospect here seen; for<lb/> even with such it is comparing small things
                    with<lb/> great ones or putting art in comparison with<lb/> nature. As far as
                    the eye can command, one wide<lb/> spreading Forest is seen, interspersed with planta-<lb/>
                    <pb n="87" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_087"/>tions or farms, and sheets of water; which have<lb/> a little the

                <p>I continued at<lb/> my relations; and, in one of our walks along the<lb/> margins
                    of the <geogName key="schuri">Schuylkill</geogName>, I observed a neat
                    little<lb/> cottage, inhabited by a black family, to which<lb/> the former owner
                    of the plantation had given their<lb/> freedom, with this cottage and a few
                    acres of land.<lb/> This little domain was managed with great econo-<lb/> my,
                    and afforded them a comfortable and inde-<lb/>pendent livelihood. We picked up
                    several land<lb/> tortoises, a species of animal which abounds in<lb/> these
                    meadows. Here is also a great abundance<lb/> of that kind of tortoise, called
                    the snapping turtle,<lb/> which makes very good soup; and, as far as I am<lb/>
                    able to judge, nearly equal to, that made from the<lb/> sea turtle. The snapping
                    turtles are voracious<lb/> animals, destructive to young ducks and
                    goslings,<lb/> layering hold of them by the legs and dragging them<lb/> under
                    water to devour them. </p>

                <p>I put 10 hogsheads of to-<lb/> bacco on board the Rose, <persName key="hath1"
                        >Captain Hathaway</persName>, for<lb/> which I paid fourpence halfpenny per

                    inclined to put under his care, I transmitted<lb/> a packet of letters, and
                    several little articles for<lb/> my family; and with them eight land
                    tortoises,<lb/> which all got safely to England. In the same vessel<lb/> M. R.
                    took her passage home, in company with<lb/> an English family, and a young man
                    from Lan-<lb/>caster, in Pennsylvania. They were favoured to<lb/> arrive safe at

                    his in-<lb/>tended return to America, was lost at sea; the ship<lb/> having
                    never been heard of after she left Liverpool.</p>
                <p>After parting with <persName key="hath1">Capt. H.</persName> I set out for

                    whole stage to ourselves, as we were all going to<lb/> attend the yearly meeting
                    in New-York. On our<lb/> way we passed <geogName key="delaw">the

                    we<lb/> dined. I have remarked that some people in Ame-<lb/> rica, have a great
                    predeliction for wearing boots,<lb/> and for smoking segars. Even children of
                    five<lb/> or six years of age, are sometimes seen, in their<lb/>
                    <pb n="89" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_089"/> boots, smoking segars. At <placeName key="trent"
                        >Trenton</placeName>, I was enter-<lb/> tained with the sight of a company
                    of journeymen<lb/> tailors, at the work-board, all booted as if ready<lb/> for
                    mounting a horse. This article of dress is<lb/> full as expensive here as in
                    England; yet a<lb/> boot-maker told me, that he sometimes sold<lb/> no less than
                    three pairs within the winter to<lb/> some individuals who earned their bread by
                    their<lb/> daily labour; and, for these, they paid 35s. ster-<lb/> ling per
                    pair. In the afternoon we passed <placeName key="prince">Prince-<lb/>

                <p>We breakfasted at <placeName key="eliza">Elizabeth<lb/> Town</placeName>; and
                    arrived at Paules-hook Ferry about<lb/> noon. Here I saw a fleet of armed
                    vessels, i. e.<lb/> four ships and one brig. As they were full of<lb/> meat and
                    guns, and the men were dressed in uni-<lb/>forms, they had a very warlike
                    appearance. This<lb/> fleet was just returned from the island of St.

                    made the most successful voyage ever re-<lb/>membered. At the ferry we were told
                    it was<lb/> O--'s fleet, and was principally belonging to a<lb/> merchant in
                    New-York of that name, who had<lb/> acquired very great riches thereby. This was
                    a<lb/> remarkable instance of the great extent to which<lb/> the merchants of

                    that this<lb/> man stopped payment a few months afterwards.<lb/>

                    Slave Merchant, with a company of slaves,<lb/> men, women, and children; who all
                    stopped at the<lb/> door of the inn where we dined. Some of them<lb/> appeared
                    much dejected; and, on my questioning<lb/> them, they told me they, were taken
                    from their<lb/> relatives and friends by force. One of the females<lb/> being
                    known to a black man in the stage, he asked<lb/> her how he came there, knowing
                    her to be a free<lb/> black. She replied, that some time since, her<lb/> husband
                    had been taken from her, and carried<lb/> into the Carolinas; and that she had
                    determined<lb/> to follow him in his bondage. This appeared to<lb/> be a
                    remarkable proof of conjugal affection, and<lb/> showed a high degree of
                    sensibility: but, in thus<lb/> following her husband, there is great reason
                    to<lb/> fear from the general conduct of these Slave<lb/>
                    <pb n="94" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_094"/> Merchants, that she herself would be sold as a slave<lb/> by this
                    man; who, under pretence of taking her to<lb/> her husband, would probably
                    betray her. This<lb/> night I lodged at <persName key="wmorg1">Wm.

                    wrought by a child of five or six years old; and<lb/> though in but little

                    <placeName key="richm">Richmond</placeName> appears to be a place of great

                    the white people with their black<lb/> female slaves. It sometimes happens here,
                    as in<lb/> other places, that the white inhabitants, in selling<lb/> the
                    offspring of these poor debased females, sell<lb/> their own sons and daughters,
                    with as much indif-<lb/>ference as they would sell their cattle. By such<lb/>
                    means, every tender sentiment of the human<lb/> breast is laid waste, and men
                    become so degraded,<lb/> that their feelings rank but little above these of<lb/>
                    the beasts of the field. In the treatment of their<lb/> offspring, how far do

                <p>An active clever woman of this place, with a<lb/> servant and two children, came

                        >Fredericksburgh</placeName>. She<lb/> told me that she was a native of

                    time to Richmond, as linen-drapers and mil-<lb/>liners; had been successful in
                    business, and had<lb/> the prospect of a continuance of success; but, as<lb/> a
                    longer residence there, would, in their view, be<lb/> attended with almost
                    certain ruin to the morals of<lb/> their children, they had determined to leave
                    the<lb/> place, and remove to a less exposed situation;<lb/> where they would
                    not be tried with the con-<lb/>taminating influence and effects of this
                    unhollowed<lb/> system of slavery. For an active, industrious<lb/> couple, with
                    a numerous rising family, thus to<lb/> come to the resolution of quitting a
                    lucrative bu-<lb/>siness and situation on these ground, is, I think,<lb/> a mark

                    about 5 miles of this<lb/> city, the stage driver told us that before
                    sun-rise<lb/> in the morning, while it was yet rather dark, close<lb/> by the
                    place we then were at, his 4 horses suddenly<lb/> stopped; but for what cause he
                    could not con-<lb/> jecture. However, on giving them a smart stroke<lb/> or two
                    with the whip, they suddenly started for-<lb/>ward, when he immediately saw a
                    very large<lb/> snake entangled amongst their legs; but, push-<lb/>ing on with
                    great violence, they soon cleared<lb/> themselves; and the stage drove directly
                    over it.<lb/> The sound of the horses hoofs, and the sensation<lb/> he felt when
                    the carriage passed over the snake,<lb/> raised in him the idea of driving over
                    several<lb/> sheaves of wheat; and, to the best of his judgment,<lb/> from the
                    faint view he had of the reptile, he be-<lb/>lieved it to be as thick as the
                    calf of of a man's leg.<lb/> The passengers were alarmed, but, on
                    recovering<lb/> from their fright, insisted upon getting out, and
                    en-<lb/>deavouring to find the snake, believing that he must<lb/> be disabled by
                    the wheels of the carriage. They ac-<lb/>cordingly searched about the place, but
                    could see<lb/> nothing of him; and, as there was a stream near,<lb/> they
                    supposed he had got into it, and had floated<lb/> down with the current. The

                <p>There is a very striking contrast between the ap-<lb/>pearance of the horses or
                    teams in Pennsylvania,<lb/>
                    <pb n="99" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_099"/> and those in the Southern States where slaves are<lb/> kept. In
                    Pennsylvania we meet great numbers<lb/> of waggons, drawn by 4 or more fine fat
                    horses;<lb/> the carriages firm and well made, and covered<lb/> with stout, good
                    linen, bleached almost white;<lb/> and it is not uncommon to see 10 or 15
                    together,<lb/> travelling cheerfully along the road, the driver<lb/> riding on
                    one of his horses. Many of these come<lb/> more than 300 miles to Philadelphia,
                    from the<lb/> Ohio, Pittsburgh, and other places; and I have been<lb/> told by a
                    respectable friend, a native of Phila-<lb/>delphia, that more than 1000 covered
                    carriages<lb/> frequently come to Philadelphia market. Indeed<lb/> the
                    appearance of them on market-days, in Market-<lb/>street, which is 2 miles in
                    length, and about 40<lb/> yards in width, is such as no stranger can have a<lb/>
                    just conception of; to say nothing of the adjoining<lb/> streets, which are
                    crowded with farmers's carts and<lb/> waggons from every quarter. </p>
                <p>The appearance of things in the Slave States is<lb/> quite the reverse of this.
                    We sometimes meet<lb/> a ragged black boy or girl, driving a team consist-<lb/>
                    ing of a lean cow and a mule; sometimes a lean<lb/> bull or an ox and a mule;
                    and I have seem a mule,<lb/> a bull, and a cow, each miserable in its
                    appear-<lb/>ance, composing one team, with a half-naked<lb/> black slave or two,
                    riding or driving, as occasion<lb/> suited. The carriage or waggon, if it may be<lb/>
                    <pb n="100" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_100"/> called such, appeared in as wretched condition<lb/> as the team
                    and its driver. Sometimes a couple<lb/> of horses, mules, or cows, &amp;c. would
                    be dragging<lb/> a hogshead of tobacco, with a pivot or axel driven<lb/> into
                    each end of the hogshead, and some thing like<lb/> a shaft attached, by which it
                    was drawn or rolled<lb/> along the road. I have seen two oxen and two<lb/>
                    slaves pretty fully employed in getting along a<lb/> single hogshead; and some
                    of these come from a<lb/> great distance inland. </p>
                <p>In the evening of this day, I had a pleasant sail<lb/> up the <geogName

                    person of the name<lb/> of Smith, was a general subject of conversation.<lb/> I
                    was informed that, in early life, he had been a<lb/> transported convict from
                    England, and had lived<lb/> and wrought with the black slaves, and had<lb/>
                    taken a wife from amongst them. Since the time<lb/> of his servitude expired, he
                    had, by industry<lb/> and management, acquired 70,000l. part of which<lb/> he
                    gave to his children by his black wife; and the<lb/> residue, being the largest
                    proportion, to his<lb/> white children. This man, I was told, was the<lb/>
                    principal stockholder in the Columbia Bank.</p>
                <p>I spent two days more at <placeName key="frede">Frederick-town</placeName>,
                    be-<lb/>ing detained by the stage. Great numbers of<lb/>
                    <pb n="102" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_102"/>black slaves are kept in this part of <placeName key="maryl"
                        >Maryland</placeName>.<lb/> One farmer was mentioned to me who kept
                    up-<lb/>wards of 200; and from the quantity of land he had<lb/> under
                    cultivation, there did not appear to be more<lb/> than 10 acres to one slave;
                    which of course could<lb/> yield but little profit to the owner. I was told
                    of<lb/> one couple of slaves he had, who lived as man and<lb/> wife, and were
                    valued at more than 400l. on ac-<lb/> count of their stout healthy children;
                    whom he<lb/> could sell at a very high price when young. From<lb/> the
                    information I received, it appeared that breed-<lb/> ing slaves was the best
                    part of his business. Such<lb/> is the corrupt state of things where slavery
                    is<lb/> permitted. </p>

                <p>This morning we passed<lb/> through <placeName key="yorkt">York-Town</placeName>,
                    where we breakfasted. At the<lb/> Assizes or Sessions, which were held at that
                    time, a<lb/> boy of about 15 years of age, was convicted of the<lb/> wilful and
                    deliberate murder of his play-fellow, a<lb/> little boy 2 or 3 years younger
                    than himself. The<lb/> reason he assigned for this cruel act was, that his<lb/>
                    companion had won a few pence from him at some<lb/>
                    <pb n="103" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_103"/> game of chance. A lawyer who had attended the<lb/> trial, was with
                    us in the stage, and said that the<lb/> culprit appeared unconcerned as to the
                    issue;<lb/> and when convicted, showed no emotion; but with<lb/> a great deal of
                    indifference requested that his<lb/> acquaintances would attend at his
                    execution; which<lb/> they did. </p>
                <p>At noon we came to the <geogName key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogName>, on the<lb/>
                    opposite shore to Columbia, where we dined.<lb/> This is one of the most
                    beautiful and romantic<lb/> parts of America. The river is here about one<lb/>
                    mile broad, with a number of beautiful little<lb/> islands spread over it. What
                    added greatly to the<lb/> beauty of the scene, were the high rocks which<lb/>
                    rise from the margin of the river, and near which<lb/> were seen many eagles and
                    fish-hawks soaring in<lb/> the air; the latter frequently darting into the<lb/>
                    water, where they make a prey of the fish. In<lb/> rising again, it frequently
                    happens that the eagles<lb/> pursue the hawks, and compel them to let go
                    their<lb/> prize; and such is the swiftness of the eagle, that<lb/> he will
                    often dart down and seize the fish, before<lb/> it reaches the water. </p>
                <p>In the shallow parts of the river, many beauti-<lb/>ful white herons are seen,
                    stalking along in<lb/> search of food, making a beautiful variety in the<lb/>
                    prospect. </p>
                <pb n="104" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_104"/>
                <p>I saw a number of large flat-bottomed boats in<lb/> this river, some of which had
                    come upwards of<lb/> 300 miles, and could carry 1000 bushels of wheat.<lb/> The
                    largest of them are more than 70 feet in length,<lb/> but calculated for one
                    voyage only, and for floating<lb/> down the rivers with the stream, over
                    shallows and<lb/> falls; for when they arrive at the place of their<lb/>
                    destination, they're taken in pieces and the<lb/> timber is used for other
                    purposes. Exclusive<lb/> of these boats, which are called arks, and have<lb/>
                    frequently a kind of cottage upon them, in which<lb/> several persons are
                    accommodated during the<lb/> voyage; there are also many large floats of
                    timber<lb/> which are so fixed together, that they appear like<lb/> one large
                    compact body, on which a small dwelling-<lb/>house is built for the
                    accommodation of a family.<lb/> These floats sometimes contain several
                    thousand<lb/> feet of timber, which are conveyed in this way se-<lb/> venty
                    hundred miles, at a very trifling expense. After<lb/> crossing this beautiful
                    river in the ferry boat, we<lb/> came to <placeName key="colum"
                        >Columbia</placeName>, a small new built town rising<lb/> fast into
                    importance. Here we again entered into<lb/> the stage, and passing through a
                    fine well-cultivated<lb/> country, on a good turnpike-road, we came to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="lanca">Lancaster</placeName>; which is considered the best
                    inland<lb/> town in North America, and is about 12 miles<lb/> distant from
                    Columbia. </p>

                <p>This was the first day of the<lb/> week: and there being no meeting of friends in<lb/>

                    <placeName key="lanca">Lancaster</placeName>, I was induced to inquire if no
                    friend<lb/> resided there, and was informed of a person resident<lb/> in the
                    town, who was a member of our society.<lb/> I called upon him and was kindly
                    entertained by<lb/> him the whole of the afternoon. After a little<lb/>
                    conversation with him, I found he was a father<lb/> to one of my customers in
                    America. I have often<lb/> thought it a great privilege in our society,
                    that<lb/> such an interchange of hospitality and freedom pre-<lb/>vails among
                    us. It has a great tendency to smooth<lb/> the path of life, especially to
                    strangers in a strange<lb/> land. In the course of conversation in this
                    family,<lb/> I found that Major Andre and Colonel Despard<lb/> had both taken up
                    their lodgings with them,<lb/> when prisoners on parole to the Americans.<lb/>
                    They spoke very respectfully of Major Andre, who<lb/> had so conducted himself
                    as to gain much upon<lb/> the affection of the whole family. Some of his<lb/>
                    drawings and letters were shewn to me, which<lb/> they preserved with great
                    care. </p>

                    I<lb/> visited P. A. and his wife at <persName key="hbowm1">H.
                    Bowman</persName>'s.<lb/> They are an ancient couple of plain, honest
                    friends,<lb/> both in the ministry. The grandfather of the for-<lb/> mer came
                    amongst friends in a remarkable way.<lb/> He resided near the sea coast in the
                    Jerseys, and<lb/> being an active lively young man, he used some-<lb/> times to
                    employ himself in playing upon a violin<lb/> amongst his neighbours; especially
                    when the young<lb/> people were collected to dance and make merry.<lb/> After
                    one of these occasions, as he was returning<lb/> home, late in the evening, he
                    observed a human<lb/> skull lying upon the sand; which, as he passed by,<lb/>
                    caused some serious reflections; but they passed<lb/> off for the present. Going
                    that way again some-<lb/>time after, the impressions very renewed, and<lb/>
                    while he was musing over the skull, which had<lb/>
                    <pb n="107" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_107"/> thus, a second time, been the means of bringing<lb/> into his mind
                    a train of serious reflections, he con-<lb/>cluded to bury this dry bone which
                    had so power-<lb/>fully preached to him. He covered it carefully<lb/> up in the
                    earth, and went home, enjoying the<lb/> pleasing reflection of having performed
                    this last<lb/> office to the remains of a fellow-creature. Such,<lb/> however,
                    were the weight and solemnity occasioned<lb/> by the impressions of his mind
                    from this circum-<lb/>stance, that a total change in his life and

                <p>I still remained at <placeName key="merio">Merion</placeName>;<lb/> and, this
                    morning, attended meeting there. In the<lb/> afternoon, I had the curiosity to
                    take a view of a<lb/> large <orgName key="metho">methodist</orgName> meeting,
                    held near us, called a<lb/> camp meeting; which had been continued about<lb/> a
                    week, almost night and day. The concourse of<lb/> people was very great; and
                    numbers of them, it<lb/> was said, had come several hundred miles to attend<lb/>
                    the meeting. Many tents and huts were erected<lb/> on the spot; and a great
                    number of carriages of<lb/> various descriptions, such as coaches,
                    coachees,<lb/> chairs, covered waggons, carts, &amp;c. &amp;c. were
                    col-<lb/>lected under the shade of a lofty forest. From<lb/> some conversation I
                    had with one of the conductors<lb/>
                    <pb n="108" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_108"/> of this assembly, I understood that great exertions<lb/> had been
                    used to preserve order, especially through<lb/> the night; and, that, at ten
                    o'clock in the evening,<lb/> patrols went round the encampment to see that<lb/>
                    all were in their proper tents and places. Those<lb/> who had not a birth within
                    the camp were sent out.<lb/> Their meetings had been kept up for several days
                    with<lb/> almost incredible zeal, from early in the morning<lb/> until late in
                    the evening; and, even after they had<lb/> withdrawn into their huts and tents,
                    numbers of<lb/> them continued in prayer through a great part of<lb/> the night.
                    It may well be supposed therefore<lb/> that the preachers were a good deal
                    exhausted;<lb/> especially as their language and gestures were<lb/> generally
                    violent. Some of the most zealous<lb/> would quite exhaust themselves in less
                    than an<lb/> hour; but, there being a considerable number on the<lb/> stage on
                    which they preached, their places were sup-<lb/>plied immediately on their
                    siting down. I observed<lb/> that a great number of Negro families
                    attended;<lb/> and many of them in handsome carriages. The<lb/> whole number of
                    persons composing this meeting<lb/> was said to be 5000. </p>

                <p>I went to <orgName key="meetrad">Radnor monthly<lb/> meeting</orgName>; at which
                    was a couple, who were about<lb/> to be married; for whose accommodation the

                    and the alteration appearing eligi-<lb/>ble for a continuance, was so
                    determined. After<lb/> meeting, I dined at J. H.'s, and supped and spent<lb/>
                    the evening at <persName key="ojone1">O. J.</persName>'s. This friend was one
                    of<lb/> those who suffered banishment on account of their<lb/> supposed
                    attachment to the British, during the<lb/>
                    <pb n="110" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_110"/> revolution. His sister told me that on William<lb/> Penn's arrival
                    in America, he lodged at her great<lb/> grandfather's at Merion. At that time
                    her grand-<lb/> father was a boy of about 12 years old; and being<lb/> a lad of
                    some curiosity, and not often seeing such<lb/> a guest as Wm. Penn, he privately
                    crept to the<lb/> chamber door, up a flight of steps, on the outside of<lb/> the
                    building, which was only a log-house. On peep-<lb/>ing through the latchet-hole,
                    he was struck with<lb/> awe, in beholding this great man upon his knees,<lb/> by
                    the bedside; and could distinctly hear him in<lb/> prayer, and thanksgiving,
                    that he was thus pro-<lb/> vided for in the wilderness. This circumstance<lb/>
                    made an impression upon the lad's mind, which<lb/> was not effaced in old
                    age.</p>

                    it; most of them coming on foot a distance of<lb/> about ten miles. At that time
                    nearly the whole<lb/> of the road was through a shady forest. Amongst<lb/> the
                    rest, <persName key="wpenn1">Wm. Penn</persName> used to come on horseback,<lb/>
                    and would occasionally take up a little bare-footed<lb/> girl behind him, to

                    ap-<lb/> pears that several friends were appointed to mark<lb/> out a road

                    <geogName key="delaw">Delaware</geogName>, where I spent an hour or two
                    agreeably.<lb/> Afterwards, he took me in his chaise to the stage<lb/> office,
                    whence I rode to the shore opposite <placeName key="borde">Borden<lb/>
                        Town</placeName> in the Mail Pilot. In crossing the <geogName key="delaw"
                        >Dela-<lb/> ware</geogName> to that place, I fell in company with a
                    respec-<lb/> table old Scotchman, who had been amusing him-<lb/>self in fishing.
                    He told me that he had sometimes<lb/> had the company of <persName key="morea"
                        >General Moreau</persName> in his amuse-<lb/>ments, of whom he spoke highly,
                    as a man of mild<lb/> and agreeable manners. I spent this evening at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="borde">Borden Town</placeName>, the residence of the noted
                        <persName key="tpayn1">Thomas<lb/> Payne</persName>. My lodgings being at
                    the tavern from<lb/> whence the stage set out early in the morning, I<lb/>
                    <pb n="113" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_113"/> was thrown into a mixed company of the towns-<lb/>people. Being a
                    stranger, this extraordinary<lb/> person was introduced as a subject of
                    conver-<lb/>sation; but the company being of different reli-<lb/>gious and
                    political sentiments, I found that nothing<lb/> correct could be gathered
                    respecting the charac-<lb/>ter of this man, even amongst his townsmen and<lb/>
                    neighbours. Some of them asserted that he was a<lb/> drunkard; others the
                    contrary. Some asserted that<lb/> he was not fit to live, and others with equal
                    earnest-<lb/>ness that he was an upright honest man, and kind<lb/> and friendly
                    to the poor. Perhaps all might have<lb/> some ground for their assertions, by
                    viewing dif-<lb/>ferent periods of his life; but what appeared the<lb/> most
                    remarkable was an observation of the land-<lb/>lady, who asserted her belief,
                    that he was an<lb/> enemy to American freedom, and that he was<lb/> supported by
                    Great Britain, and was the friend of<lb/> that Government. In proof of her
                    assertion, she<lb/> said that he had treacherously mixed black sand<lb/> in the
                    American gunpowder, intended to be used<lb/> against the English. All this,
                    however, manifested<lb/> that the mind of man is liable to be darkened and<lb/>
                    clouded by party spirit, which so much prevails in<lb/> the world; and which
                    seems inseparable from free<lb/> Governments, when mankind, individually,
                    are<lb/> unwilling to come under the government of the<lb/> Prince of Peace.

                    for <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName> directly after a breakfast
                    made<lb/> chiefly of stewed oysters. These shell-fish abound<lb/> so much here,
                    that little children are taught to eat<lb/> them to breakfast. The landlady told
                    me, that she<lb/> sometimes had 2 or 300 bushels in the cellar, at a<lb/> time,
                    in the winter season. After being on board<lb/> about a quarter of an hour, we
                    were invited by<lb/> signal to touch at Perth <placeName key="amboy"
                        >Amboy</placeName>, on the opposite<lb/> shore; where we landed about ten
                    o'clock, and<lb/> took in two families for <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName>. As we sailed<lb/> along this Bay, I had an
                    opportunity of seeing the<lb/> oyster fishers, who were busily employed.
                    The<lb/> instruments they generally used, somewhat resem-<lb/> bled two
                    hay-rakes, with long iron teeth, having<lb/> the handles, which are very long,
                    pinned together<lb/> about two feet from the heads of the rakes, so as<lb/> to
                    open and shut like a pair of large pincers.<lb/> These instruments, which are
                    called tongs, are<lb/> opened wide when the heads are let down from<lb/> the
                    boat; and, as soon as they reach the bottom,<lb/> the men close them, and the
                    teeth of the rakes<lb/> meeting drag the oysters together. By this method<lb/>
                    from one to three or four oysters are taken at a<lb/> time.</p>
                <pb n="116" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_116"/>
                <p>In sailing from <placeName key="pambo">Port Amboy</placeName> to <placeName
                        key="nycit">New-York</placeName>,<lb/> we picked up a good new boat, worth
                    10 or 12<lb/> guineas, which was drifting out to sea. Having<lb/> been so
                    detained at Perth <placeName key="amboy">Amboy</placeName>, and the wind<lb/>
                    proving unfavourable, we did not arrive at New-<lb/>York until after dark. As
                    the yellow fever had for<lb/> some time prevailed at <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName>, I was desirous of<lb/> being put on shore at
                        <placeName key="brook1">Brooklyn</placeName>, on Long Island;<lb/> but, the
                    night being dark with wind and rain, I<lb/> could not prevail upon the Captain
                    of the packet<lb/> to land me; nor could I obtain a boat of any kind<lb/> to
                    take me over. I was therefore under the neces-<lb/> sity of going to <placeName
                        key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, where all was silent<lb/> and solitary;
                    and what used to be the busiest parts,<lb/> were now without an inhabitant to be
                    seen. </p>
                <p>Having landed at <placeName key="quinc">Quince's Wharf</placeName>, I went
                    along<lb/> Water-street to the Fly-market wharf, hoping to<lb/> meet with the
                    ferry-boat; but here likewise all was<lb/> silence and solitude. I then went
                    through the<lb/> whole length of Fly-market, which had the ap-<lb/>pearance of
                    having been untrodden for weeks past;<lb/> the light of some lamps shewing the
                    boarded floor<lb/> to be as clean as that of a parlour. From the
                    Fly-<lb/>market, I crossed Pearl-street, into Maiden-lane,<lb/> and went on to
                    Broad-way, to the City Hotel, a<lb/> large spacious inn; where I was the only
                    guest.<lb/> When I was here last, the house was crowded with<lb/> company; so
                    much had this awful visitation varied<lb/> the scene in every part of this busy
                    city. Some<lb/>
                    <pb n="117" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_117"/> of its inhabitants, with whom I had been well<lb/> acquainted, had
                    been suddenly taken away by the<lb/> ravages of that dreadful disease. The next
                    morn-<lb/> ing I left <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, and passing
                    through <placeName key="greew">Green-<lb/>wich</placeName>, and over Harlem
                    Bridge, I arrived at<lb/>
                    <persName key="twill1">T. W.</persName>'s to dinner. There I spent the afternoon
                    in<lb/> company with one of the Pilots for the Sound, a<lb/> healthy old man
                    between 80 and 90 years of age, who<lb/> frequently walked 20 miles a-day. In
                    coming up<lb/> to <persName key="twill1">T. W.</persName>'s, I passed through
                        <placeName key="greew">Greenwich</placeName>, a village<lb/> to which the
                    business of <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, together with<lb/> the
                    banks and public offices, were removed on ac-<lb/> count of the yellow fever.
                    The bustle and con-<lb/>fusion occasioned thereby is not easily conceived.<lb/>
                    For the accommodation of the merchants, many<lb/> temporary wooden buildings
                    were erected. </p>

                    of<lb/> the decease of his wife. She had been lately re-<lb/>moved by the yellow
                    fever, having, it was sup-<lb/> posed, taken the infection the day previous
                    to<lb/> her coming to <placeName key="westc">West Chester</placeName>; to which
                    place the<lb/> family had removed for safety from the infection.<lb/> The
                    removal of this valuable friend, has been a<lb/> very trying dispensation to her
                    husband and family.<lb/> If I understand right, she has left 13 children. </p>
                <pb n="118" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_118"/>
                <p>In conversation with her daughters, I under-<lb/>stood that that the family were
                    not aware that her<lb/> complaint was the yellow fever, until after her<lb/>
                    decease. She was preserved in so much stillness<lb/> and quietness, and,
                    apparently, under so little<lb/> bodily pain during the progress of the
                    disorder,<lb/> that they had no apprehension of its being this<lb/> dreadful
                    complaint, until afterwards informed by<lb/> the medical attendants. I lodged

                <p>This afternoon I left F. T.'s,<lb/> and went on board a Hudson packet, called
                    the<lb/> Traveller, of which Ely Bunker, a friend of Hud-<lb/> son, was owner
                    and captain. As soon as the tide<lb/> served, we sailed up the <geogName
                        key="nrive">North River</geogName>, having in<lb/> company a young man from
                    Hudson, and a young<lb/> woman that way on her way to visit a sister who<lb/>
                    lay sick at Hudson.</p>

                <p>This and the preceding night<lb/> I lodged on board the packet. In sailing along this<lb/>
                    <pb n="119" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_119"/> river, the scenery and prospects are in many<lb/> places grand and
                    beautiful in a high degree; espe-<lb/>cially in sailing by the Highlands, Stoney
                    Point,<lb/> and the <geogName key="catmo">Katskill Mountains</geogName>.
                    Sometimes, for a<lb/> considerable distance, the rocks rise from the edge<lb/>
                    of the river, in bold, lofty precipices, similar to<lb/> those of Middleton
                    Dale, in Derbyshire; and the<lb/> river, in many parts, is from one to two
                    miles<lb/> over. This gives room for the vessels, which<lb/> navigate the river,
                    to pass and repass each other<lb/> without danger; although the number is said
                    to be<lb/> upwards of 1600. They consist chiefly of sloops<lb/> of about 70 tons
                    burthen; yet large ships are occa-<lb/>sionally seen as high up as Hudson's and
                    Athens,<lb/> being about 150 miles up the country. In sailing<lb/> on this
                    river, we sometimes had the sight of 15 or 20<lb/> vessels within a short
                    distance of us; and <persName key="cbunk1">Captain<lb/> Bunker</persName>
                    mentioned that he had sometimes seen 30<lb/> in company. Although this river is
                    pretty straight,<lb/> in general, yet it frequently winds its way between<lb/>
                    lofty rocks and mountains, which cause a variety<lb/> of currents in the wind,
                    so as to require a good<lb/> deal of care and management to work the
                    vessels<lb/> to advantages. It was amusing sometimes to ob-<lb/>serve that,
                    while we lay becalmed on one side of the<lb/> stream under a lofty rock, the
                    vessels which hap-<lb/> pened to be on the contrary side, would skim past<lb/>
                    us like an arrow, with a fair wind, leaving us far<lb/> behind; and at the same
                    time the company would<lb/> divert themselves at our difficulties as they glided<lb/>
                    <pb n="120" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_120"/> past; but, before we got many miles, it sometimes<lb/> happened
                    that the tables were turned; and the winds<lb/> would favour us to get before
                    those who had so<lb/> recently derided us. To persons disposed to<lb/> moralize,
                    there was somewhat instructive in these<lb/> changes of scene; as we may not
                    unfrequently<lb/> observe similar occurrences in our passage through<lb/> life.

                <p>I arrived at <placeName key="huds">Hudson</placeName> early<lb/> in the
                    afternoon, and paid for my passage, of<lb/> about 150 miles, one dollar and a

                    liquor during the voyage. As we<lb/> were about leaving the sloop, a boy came
                    on<lb/> board, and abruptly told the young woman, our<lb/> fellow-passenger,
                    that her sister, whom she was<lb/> come to see, had just breathed her last.
                    That<lb/> proved more than the poor girl could bear; and<lb/> she was not in a
                    situation to leave the vessel while<lb/> I staid. It was a great pity that more
                    caution<lb/> was not observed in conveying such afflictive intel-<lb/> ligence.
                    In stepping ashore at Hudson, one of the<lb/> first persons I met with was

                <p>I spent this day pleasantly at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="sunny">Sunnyside</placeName>, the residence of a relation, and
                    went with<lb/> him over his farm. He has purchased 300 acres<lb/> of land, with
                    a dwelling-house and barn, for 900l.<lb/> sterling. The estate runs near a mile
                    on the<lb/> banks of a river, which is stored with plenty of fish,<lb/> and
                    which passes into the <geogName key="nrive">North River</geogName> about
                    five<lb/> miles below. On the opposite side of the farm,<lb/> there is a good
                    turnpike-road, leaving to Hudson,<lb/> &amp;c. About 100 acres are cleared from
                    wood,<lb/> and are in a state of cultivation; remaining<lb/> 200 acres being
                    wood land, are esteemed the<lb/> most valuable. There are about 20 acres of<lb/>
                    meadow near the river. This land is very rich<lb/> and productive; and the whole
                    of the estate,<lb/> if in many parts of Yorkshire, would be thought<lb/> good
                    and valuable land: inferior, I believe, is<lb/> sometimes sold for 100l. per

                <p>This day I came to <orgName key="meethudson">Hudson<lb/> meeting</orgName>, in
                    company with as many of H. M.'s<lb/> family as could ride in their coachee, a
                    handsome<lb/> carriage drawn by two horses. After meeting I<lb/> dined at the
                    house of a worthy elder. In conversa-<lb/>tion he gave me a little history of H.
                    B. whose near<lb/> neighbour and friend he had been for many years;<lb/> even
                    for some time before she appeared as a<lb/> minister. Her first appearances, he
                    observed,<lb/> were very acceptable, and in a good degree of<lb/> humility.
                    About that time he accompanied J. T.<lb/> on a visit to her, who expressed his
                    belief that she<lb/> was rightly called, and encouraged her in the<lb/> exercise
                    of her gift. This circumstance tended<lb/> to open her way more fully in the
                    minds of friends,<lb/> and her communications became more frequent,<lb/> and
                    were enlarged. Notwithstanding this, the<lb/> friend observed to me, that he
                    very often had his<lb/> fears on her account, and sometimes imparted them<lb/>
                    to her. About the time she applied for a certi-<lb/> ficate to visit England, he
                    felt more forcibly her<lb/> danger, and that it would he increased by her
                    in-<lb/>troduction to the cities of Europe; and it was<lb/> some time before he
                    could determine to sign her<lb/> certificate; but the fear of appearing
                    singular,<lb/> outweighed his better feelings, and he accordingly<lb/> signed
                    it. Notwithstanding the very fallacious<lb/> sentiments she had propagated, I
                    felt charity and<lb/> good-will towards her; and called to see her hus-<lb/>
                    band; she being from home. </p>

                <p>I spent this day pleasantly at<lb/>

                    hollow tree; but we were obliged<lb/> to hew down the tree before we could
                    come<lb/> at the prize. The American hare is not like<lb/> either the hare or
                    the rabbit of England, but has<lb/> the appearance of a mixture of both. When
                    the<lb/> poor creature was taken, it cried like an infant. </p>

                    with us in the coachee, and found the<lb/> innkeepers very cheerfully spread a
                    table, with a<lb/> cloth and knives and forks, being well satisfied<lb/> with
                    the profit on the feed of our horses and the<lb/> little liquor we drank. This
                    being the general<lb/> practice, it makes travelling more easy as to

                    he was for some time in his travels in this country.<lb/> During the Revolution,
                    T. M. with some other<lb/> friends, was taken prisoner by the British, and<lb/>
                    confined a long time on board a prison ship.<lb/> Whilst there, he employed
                    himself in making a<lb/> variety of little articles in wood, some of which<lb/>
                    he showed me. They were very neatly executed,<lb/> and bore testimony that they
                    had been made,<lb/> rather to pass on time than to earn wages. In<lb/> one of
                    these memories of his captivity, he had<lb/>
                    <pb n="125" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_125"/> a quantity of tea, which had been gathered in the<lb/> woods about

                <p>I attended <orgName key="meetnp">Nine Partners<lb/> Quarterly Meeting</orgName>.
                    At this meeting there were<lb/> three friends in the gallery, sitting near
                    together,<lb/> whose ages united made about 300 years. After<lb/> meeting, we
                    spent an hour or two in the school<lb/> for friends' children, where the
                    teachers kindly<lb/> brought forward a few of their best readers, both<lb/> boys
                    and girls, and gave us a specimen of their<lb/> abilities in that branch of
                    learning. Some of them<lb/> read well, and did credit to the institution.<lb/>
                    Amongst the teachers, I observed a young couple,<lb/> who had been married some
                    time: the husband<lb/> was between 17 and 18 years old, and the wife a<lb/>
                    little older, but not much. One consequence of<lb/> such early marriages is,
                    that many generations are<lb/> frequently seen living at the same time. The<lb/>
                    children of my acquaintance, <persName key="jbidd1">John<lb/> Biddle</persName>,
                    of Philadelphia, are the seventh genera-<lb/> tion; the female head of which
                    family was a friend<lb/> then living. In the afternoon I visited T. R. and<lb/>
                    his wife, in whose company we spent half an hour<lb/> pleasantly. After leaving
                    them, we set out for<lb/>
                    <orgName key="stanfordqm">Stamford quarterly meeting</orgName>, and lodged at A.

                <p>Came to <persName key="punde1">P. U.</persName>'s, where I<lb/> lodged. Here I
                    saw several articles very neatly<lb/>
                    <pb n="126" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_126"/> painted, and which appeared to me neater and<lb/> more lively than
                    oil painting, and which, I was<lb/> informed, consisted of nothing but the
                    colouring<lb/> substance ground down with curds. Here I also<lb/> saw a quantity
                    of sewing silk made in this coun-<lb/> try, and produced from silk worms raised
                    in<lb/> Mansfield, in Connecticut; in which place upwards<lb/> of ten tons of
                    silk had been produced the last year.<lb/> In the afternoon of this day we
                    visited M. C. at<lb/> his farm, which is one of the neatest and best<lb/>
                    conducted I have seen, where I saw a ram from<lb/> the Straits of Magellan,
                    which had been presented<lb/> to him by his brother Captain H. who had
                    brought<lb/> it from thence. The animal was of great strength,<lb/> and much
                    larger than any English sheep. He had<lb/> two large horns standing upwards,
                    somewhat like<lb/> those of a goat; and two others growing from<lb/> near the
                    roots of the former, twisted like those of<lb/> other sheep. His colour was
                    black, and his wool<lb/> of a coarse quality. Afterwards we visited Captain<lb/>
                    S. C. at his farm, which is, I believe, a very good<lb/> one; and it has an
                    excellent house and good accom-<lb/>modation, and is very pleasantly situated.
                    On our<lb/> way this friend met and passed us, with a waggon<lb/> load of
                    slaughtered hogs for the next country store;<lb/> but he soon returned, and we
                    supped and spent a few<lb/> hours very pleasantly with him and his wife. As<lb/>
                    Captain C. was the commander of the Fortitude,<lb/> in which I came over to
                    America the first time,<lb/> in company with <persName key="tscat1">Thomas

                    From my observations here and<lb/> in other meetings, in New-York State in

                    dress and furniture,<lb/> without sufficiently coming under that
                    ameliorating<lb/> influence which draws out of any reliance on par-<lb/>ticular
                    forms of dress and furniture. Truth and<lb/> sound sense lead into neatness,
                    decency, and mode-<lb/>ration in these respects; but extremes do harm. By<lb/>
                    keeping the eye and attention constantly fixed too<lb/> much on outward things,
                    the better part is in some<lb/> danger of being neglected. In the evening
                    we<lb/> returned to J. M.'s, where we lodged that night;<lb/> and the next

                    with the before-mentioned friend.<lb/> Here is a very neat meeting-house, kept
                    clean and<lb/> in good repair. There is something not quite right,<lb/> or at
                    least something that produces very unpleasant<lb/> feelings and reflections, in
                    suffering meeting-houses<lb/> to become dirty and out of repair. We
                    sometimes<lb/> judge of the estimation in which people hold their<lb/> guests by
                    the room assigned for their reception and<lb/> entertainment. What those people
                    think who<lb/> suffer their places for worship to remain a scene of<lb/> dirt
                    and ruin, whilst perhaps their own habitations<lb/> are superfluously elegant, I
                    cannot comprehend;<lb/> I fear it bespeaks their having no very high idea
                    of<lb/> the Divine Majesty, to whose service they profess<lb/> to appropriate
                    such buildings. This meeting-house<lb/> at Troy, I was informed, was built
                    chiefly by two<lb/> female friends, whose husbands had sometime<lb/> before been
                    disowned for dealing in spirituous<lb/> liquors; this traffic being contrary to
                    the rules of<lb/> friends in New-York State. Those persons not<lb/> seeing the
                    propriety of the rule, or not choosing to<lb/>
                    <pb n="130" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_130"/> forego the profits of this branch of their trade,<lb/> had
                    suffered themselves to be disunited. At<lb/> the same time they declared that
                    although<lb/> friends disowned them, they would not disown<lb/> their friends.
                    Since their separation they have<lb/> attended friends meetings for worship;
                    and,<lb/> being people of property, they have, on all<lb/> occasions, encouraged
                    their wives to be ge-<lb/>nerous in their contributions towards the neces-<lb/>
                    sary expense of the society. I was told that in<lb/> this instance their two
                    wives had furnished the<lb/> means of defraying nearly the whole expense of<lb/>
                    building this handsome meeting-house. In the<lb/> afternoon I parted with J. B.
                    and set out for<lb/>
                    <placeName key="schen">Schenectady</placeName> on the <geogName key="mohaw"
                        >Mohawk River</geogName>. I arrived<lb/> there early in the evening where I
                    lodged. This<lb/> day I sent letters to my dear wife by J. B. to<lb/> be
                    forwarded from New-York.</p>

                <p>I crossed the <geogName key="mohaw">Mo-<lb/> hawk river</geogName>, and travelled
                    about 30 miles on the<lb/> Genesee Turnpike. Having company I stopped<lb/> with
                    them at an inn, where we lodged. This inn<lb/> does no credit to the country.

                <p>I was joined by an agree-<lb/> able young man from Hudson, of the name of<lb/>
                    <persName key="osbo1">Osborne</persName>, who is in the practice of the law.
                    He<lb/> had also in company with him a respectable trades-<lb/> man from
                    Balls-town Springs; so we travelled along<lb/> pleasantly through the romantic
                    valley of the <geogName key="mohaw">Mo-<lb/>hawk</geogName>, and, in our
                    journey, saw a few straggling<lb/> Indians climbing up the mountains. In the
                    even-<lb/> ing we came to the smaller falls of that river,<lb/> where the
                    navigation is aided by a number of well<lb/> constructed locks. The fall is
                    about 70 feet.<lb/> Here is a pretty little town having some good inns,<lb/> and
                    standing in a most beautiful and romantic situa-<lb/>tion, somewhat resembling
                    Matlock; but the<lb/> scenery is more rugged and stupendous. </p>
                <p>Here we lodged; and the next morning, the <date when="1805-11-20">20th<lb/> of
                        11th Month</date>, we set out, along the German<lb/>
                    <pb n="132" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_132"/> Flats, to <placeName key="kerse">Kerseymere</placeName>, where we
                    breakfasted at<lb/> a very good inn, although about 200 miles inland.<lb/> In
                    travelling this road, we sometimes observe ves-<lb/>tiges of the devastation
                    formerly made, through<lb/> the instigations of the English or French
                    Govern-<lb/>ments, by the Indians, as they were prevailed upon,<lb/> sometimes
                    one power and sometimes by the<lb/> other, to join in their wars and quarrels.
                    How<lb/> degrading that men, placed in authority, and pro-<lb/>fessing to be the
                    followers of Christ, should be<lb/> thus employed in working upon the simplicity
                    of<lb/> the poor Indians! In the afternoon we came to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="utica">Utica</placeName>, an improving place, of considerable

                    and left<lb/> the horse which his son so kindly lent me at<lb/> Albany; having
                    replaced him with one I bought<lb/> at Fort Schuyler. </p>

                <p>This day I passed through<lb/>
                    <placeName key="clint">Clinton</placeName>, where I dined; and, in the evening
                    came<lb/> to an Indian village, called <placeName key="broth"
                        >Brothertown</placeName>. Here I<lb/> was comfortably accommodated at the
                    house of<lb/> an Indian, whose name was <persName key="oscip1">Obadiah
                        Scipio</persName>. His<lb/> wife <persName key="escip1"
                    >Elizabeth</persName>, is the daughter of an Indian Chief<lb/> of the name of
                    Fowler. She was a personable<lb/> woman and of art expressive countenance,
                    and<lb/> was very industrious. Her dairy produced ex-<lb/> cellent cheese and
                    butter, notwithstanding a<lb/> great part of her time was employed in spin-<lb/>
                    <pb n="133" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_133"/>ning for the family apparel, which was very<lb/> decent. It was
                    mostly prepared for the weaver<lb/> by her own household; and, whilst I was in
                    the<lb/> house, a female weaver of the village, brought in<lb/> a piece of cloth
                    made from yarn spun in this<lb/> family, which was such as would have done
                    cre-<lb/>dit to any female in England. This reputable<lb/> Indian couple had
                    four fine healthy children, who<lb/> sat by the fire; and, though of a copper
                    colour,<lb/> their countenances were far from unpleasing.<lb/> Their names where
                    Denis, Calvin, Cinthia, and<lb/> Celinda. </p>
                <p>The schoolmaster of this Indian village, who<lb/> is paid by friends, introduced
                    me to a chief of<lb/> the name of <persName key="haupa1">Hendricks</persName>,
                    with whom I had some<lb/> conversation; and we sat about an hour by the<lb/>
                    fire-side of a pretty large family of Indians, where<lb/> it was pleasant to see
                    the spinning-wheel go<lb/> briskly round. There were 16 or 18 Indians<lb/> round
                    the fire; the older part of the family sat<lb/> on a bench in front, and the
                    little Indians on the<lb/> ground on each side. The fire was made at the<lb/>
                    end of the building, and the smoke found its way<lb/> through the roof, without
                    the aid of a chimney.<lb/> The walls and roof were hung with ears of Indian<lb/>
                    corn, and other winter provisions. It is difficult<lb/> to describe my feelings,
                    on sitting down with an<lb/> Indian family in this way. In a sympathising<lb/>
                    <pb n="134" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_134"/> mind, sensations of pity and compassion will pre-<lb/>dominate. On
                    the other hand it is not unlikely<lb/> that a similar feeling may prevail in the
                    breasts of<lb/> these children of the forest, towards those who<lb/> may
                    consider themselves as raised far above them<lb/> in education and civilized
                    life. It is remarkable<lb/> that an Indian boy or girl is rarely found
                    willing<lb/> to change native habits, for those of towns and<lb/> cities; but
                    there are many instances, I am told, of<lb/> those who are called civilized
                    people, assimilating<lb/> their manners with the Indian's; and of giving
                    their<lb/> mode of life the preference. Man, as man, is a<lb/> strange and
                    incomprehensible being when left to<lb/> himself; whether in what is called a
                    savage or a<lb/> civilized state. In either, when so left, he stands<lb/>
                    equally a ready instrument, in the hand of the<lb/> common enemy of the peace
                    and happiness of the<lb/> world.</p>
                <p>I spent the remainder of this evening by <persName key="oscip1"
                    >Scipio</persName>'s<lb/> fire-side, and was accommodated with a good bed<lb/>
                    at night, on which I slept comfortably. Both the<lb/> sides and ceiling of that
                    part of the building in<lb/> which I lodged, were covered with ears of
                    Indian<lb/> corn in the husk; which, to me, had a novel but<lb/> not an
                    unpleasant appearance.</p>

                <p>I visited the Indian school-<lb/> master and his school, and was presented with

                        <p>Awhile he wrote, awhile he read, <lb/>Awhile he learnt the grammar rules;

                <p>From the Indian village of <placeName key="broth">Brother Town</placeName>,
                    I<lb/> came to another settlement of theirs, called the<lb/> Orchard. Many of
                    their habitations are formed<lb/> principally of the bark of trees, attached to
                    posts,<lb/> which are fixed in the ground; the roofs being<lb/>
                    <pb n="137" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_137"/> also of bark; but as it is taken off the trees in<lb/> broad
                    pieces, they contrive to make a pretty warm<lb/> dwelling. A few chiefs, and
                    others, have good<lb/> houses of wood, well furnished; and some of the<lb/>
                    Indians, being very good workmen, and having<lb/> complete sets of tools, I have
                    seen houses of their<lb/> building superior to many in England. </p>
                <p>As the whole of this day's journey lay amongst<lb/> the Indians, whose
                    habitations are pretty numerous<lb/> in this quarter, I had a fair opportunity
                    of forming<lb/> some judgment of the progress they have made in<lb/> the useful
                    arts of civilized life; and I confess it is<lb/> my opinion, that many in these
                    villages, are further<lb/> advanced in this respect, and enjoy more of the<lb/>
                    comforts of life, than many of the inhabitants of<lb/> the remote parts of Great
                    Britain and Ireland. </p>
                <p>In passing by one of their habitations, I noticed<lb/> the Indian manner of
                    preparing deer skins for use.<lb/> After taking off the hair, they sew up the
                    skin<lb/> like a bag; and one end being suspended by a<lb/> support, the lower
                    end is brought close over a<lb/> vessel, containing a small fire, of green
                    wood,<lb/> at the bottom. The carbonic acid ascend-<lb/>ing with the smoke, so
                    impregnates the skin,<lb/> that it becomes a dutiable and elastic leather;<lb/>
                    very suitable for their shoes, or moccasons, and<lb/> other useful purposes.
                    This operation was going<lb/> forward under the piazza of a very good frame-<lb/>
                    <pb n="138" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_138"/>house; and, from the appearance of the inhabi-<lb/> tants, I
                    suppose the matter was a chief of the first<lb/> order. Upon his head he had a
                    very grotesque<lb/> kind of cap, much resembling a lofty antique<lb/> helmet.
                    His daughter, who appeared to be a girl<lb/> about 13 years old, had a very
                    pleasing Indian<lb/> countenance; and her arms were ornamented with<lb/> silver
                    bracelets of considerable breadth, both above<lb/> and below the elbow. Though
                    her dress was en-<lb/>tirely in the Indian fashion, with moccasons, leg-<lb/>
                    gings, blanket, &amp;c.; but, being neat, clean, and of<lb/> finer materials
                    than usual, she had not an inelegant<lb/> appearance. These people understood a
                    little<lb/> English; but, at several of their habitations, where<lb/> I called
                    in the course of the day, they either could<lb/> not or would not understand
                    what I said. Some<lb/> of the younger boys and girls laughed immo-<lb/>
                    derately, on my inquiring of them the road; but<lb/> without being able,
                    seemingly, to give me any<lb/> other answer. As I went along, I met with
                    two<lb/> clever-looking Indian young men, carpenters,<lb/> having their tools
                    with them. And under the<lb/> piazza of a commodious Indian dwelling, I
                    saw,<lb/> hung up in that order, the harness and yokes of<lb/> horses and oxen.
                    There was also a good farm<lb/> yard surrounded with barns and stables, the
                    whole<lb/> having every appearance of good management.</p>
                <p>In the evening I joined my old companion again<lb/> on the Genesee road; having
                    parted with him in<lb/>
                    <pb n="139" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_139"/> going to B. S.'s. This night we took up our<lb/> lodgings at a
                    very good inn, kept by a <persName key="stock1">Doctor<lb/> Stockden</persName>.
                    Although in the midst of the <orgName key="oneida">Oneida<lb/>
                    Indians</orgName>, and 300 or 400 miles inland from Phila-<lb/> delphia or
                    New-York, the room in which I slept<lb/> was elegantly furnished. It had an
                    excellent<lb/> bed, &amp;c. the floor was spread with good carpet,<lb/> and the
                    curtains of the windows and of the bed<lb/> were of smart Manchester print. I
                    observed<lb/> several stout Indian men sitting in the bar room;<lb/> but they
                    were not suffered to get intoxicated, which<lb/> I thought was greatly to the
                    Doctor's credit, as<lb/> many of the tavern keepers supply them to excess. </p>

                <p>We set out early and came<lb/> to a large good inn, belonging to an <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneida</orgName> Indian,<lb/> who has assumed the name of
                        <persName key="jdenn1">John Denny</persName>. This<lb/> is a large brick
                    house, having four good rooms,<lb/> and a spacious passage and staircase on the
                    ground<lb/> floor. The rooms were not less than 18 feet by<lb/> 20 feet, lofty
                    and well furnished. He had an offer<lb/> of 82l. 2s. 6d. a year rent for it, or
                    one dollar<lb/> per day, which he had accepted. This house<lb/> of <persName
                        key="jdenn1">Denny</persName>'s, and that belonging to <persName
                        key="stock1">Stockden</persName>,<lb/> were built by Indian workmen, and do
                    them great<lb/> credit. <persName key="jdenn1">Denny</persName> has two
                    daughters, one of whom<lb/> was lately married to a German, a respectable<lb/>
                    farmer; and her father, according to a promise<lb/> he made, gave him one bushel
                    of dollars as her<lb/> portion; and, I was told, he sometimes says, that<lb/>
                    <pb n="140" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_140"/> if his other daughter marries a prudent respectable<lb/> young
                    man, he will give her two bushels of dollars<lb/> for her portion. </p>
                <p>The Genessee turnpike road passes through a<lb/> large tract of land belonging to
                    this Indian; and<lb/> has so much raised the value of it, that he has<lb/> sold
                    some small lots near the road, as high as 6l.<lb/> sterling per acre, which is a
                    great price in such a<lb/> remote situation. </p>
                <p>As I sat in <persName key="jdenn1">John Denny</persName>'s house, I was told
                    by<lb/> an intelligent person of the family, that build-<lb/> ing so good a
                    house, and making such improve-<lb/>ments had nearly cost him his life, by
                    raising the<lb/> envy and indignation of the neighbouring chiefs.<lb/> Under the
                    influence of these unworthy passions,<lb/> they had called him before one of
                    their council<lb/> fires, and informed him that they had taken his<lb/>
                    proceedings into consideration, and were deter-<lb/> mined that he should have
                    the improvements he<lb/> had made, and remove into some other part of the<lb/>
                    country; that they had observed he was become<lb/> proud, like the white people;
                    that the house he<lb/> had built was very unbecoming an Indian; and<lb/> that he
                    must quit it without further delay. In<lb/> reply, he told them that he was
                    ready to comply<lb/> with the orders of the chief of his nation, provided<lb/>
                    they would make him satisfaction for the great<lb/> expense he had been at; but
                    not otherwise. The<lb/>
                    <pb n="141" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_141"/> council broke up without any thing further being<lb/> done at that
                    time. </p>
                <p>Shortly after another council was held by the<lb/> chiefs; and a messenger was
                    sent to the house<lb/> requiring his attendance; but, fearing some vio-<lb/>
                    lence was intended, he refused to comply. This<lb/> refusal so irritated the
                    chiefs so far that they imme-<lb/> diately sent out four warriors, with orders
                    to put<lb/> him to death; but, observing them as they ap-<lb/> proached the
                    house, he put himself in a posture<lb/> of defence; and, being joined by his
                    brother and<lb/> two white persons who happened to be in the<lb/> house, they
                    were able to make such a defence,<lb/> that, after a sharp contest, in which
                    both sides<lb/> suffered severely, the warriors were compelled to<lb/> fly,
                    covered with blood, being grievously wounded.<lb/> Thus circumstanced, he
                    applied for protection to<lb/> the <orgName key="usag">government of the United
                        States</orgName>; and abjuring<lb/> his allegiance to the <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneida nation</orgName>, and taking the<lb/> oaths of
                    allegiance to the United States, he became<lb/> a citizen thereof. In
                    consequence of this conduct,<lb/> an officer of the United States duly apprised the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="oneida">Oneida chiefs</orgName> that <persName key="jdenn1">John
                        Denny</persName> was now become a<lb/> citizen thereof, and of course was
                    under the protec-<lb/> tion of that government; and that the government<lb/> was
                    determined to protect him. The officer also<lb/> stated, that if the <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneida nation</orgName> committed any fur-<lb/> ther outrage
                    against <persName key="jdenn1">Denny</persName>, it would be considered<lb/> as
                    a reach of the treaty of peace and amity then<lb/>
                    <pb n="142" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_142"/> subsisting between them, and they might take the<lb/>
                    consequences, which would fall very heavily upon<lb/> them. Since this period,
                    he has not been dis-<lb/>turbed by the Indians; but is going quietly for-<lb/>
                    ward with the improvement of his lands, which<lb/> are rising rapidly in value. </p>
                <p>My companion, who had come with me from<lb/> near Skenectady, having some
                    business with <persName key="jdenn1">John<lb/> Denny</persName>, the Indian,
                    respecting a mill seat which<lb/> he wished to purchase, I left him, and
                    pursued<lb/> my way on the Genesee road. In the evening I<lb/> reached Moss's
                    tavern, in company with an agree-<lb/> able person, whom I met with soon after
                    leaving<lb/> John Denny's house. In travelling along this day,<lb/> saw some
                    wild deer cross the road. They ap-<lb/> peared more light and a native than
                    those in the<lb/> parks of England; and, in bounding along, seemed<lb/> almost
                    as light as air, being at that time pursued<lb/> by a hunter's dog. Here they
                    are hunted for food,<lb/> and not for sport, as in England. </p>

                <p>I travelled along the Genesee<lb/> turn-pike, and passed many fine tracts of
                    land,<lb/> covered with beech, the sugar maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/> Much of the
                    land in these parts, I believe, could<lb/> scarcely be sold tor 10s. per acre,
                    to be paid for<lb/> in cash; and yet, in the neighbourhood of many<lb/>
                    principal towns in Great Britain, would be<lb/> thought cheap at 100l. per acre.
                    From the many<lb/>
                    <pb n="143" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_143"/> local advantages of sod, climate, &amp;c. I think it is<lb/> very
                    probable that the long-extending line of the<lb/> Genesee turnpike-road, may, in
                    a few years, be as<lb/> thickly inhabited as some parts of Europe are at<lb/>
                    this time. In the afternoon I refreshed myself<lb/> and horse at a comfortable
                    inn on the outlet of<lb/> the <geogName key="lakesc">Lake
                        Schaneatetes</geogName>, which forms a sort of mill-<lb/>dam, covering a
                    space of about 3 miles by 15.<lb/> It was pleasant to observe, on this outlet, a
                    num-<lb/> ber of mills, sufficient to do the work of some<lb/> thousands of
                    Virginia slaves. It is greatly to be la-<lb/>mented that the absurd policy of
                    the Southern<lb/> States, has placed these poor creatures as a barrier<lb/>
                    against every improvement in mechanics, &amp;c.<lb/> Vice as well as virtue
                    brings its own reward; but<lb/> the sufferings of those poor objects, on whom
                    this<lb/> false policy of the vicious exerts its baneful in-<lb/>fluence, are
                    much to be lamented; and a truly<lb/> feeling mind will deeply sympathize with
                    the un-<lb/>happy sufferers, thus deprived of every outward<lb/> consolation
                    that can make an existence in the<lb/> world desirable. </p>
                <p>Some of the mills were employed in the manu-<lb/>factory of cloths. On the banks
                    of this lake are<lb/> many delightful situations, which would be highly<lb/>
                    valued in a country like England. On every side<lb/> they descend with a bold
                    slope, and are generally<lb/> covered with fine timber, excepting here and
                    there<lb/> an insulated plantation, where the ground is<lb/>
                    <pb n="144" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_144"/> cleared. These cultivated farms add greatly to<lb/> the beauty and
                    variety of the scenery. After<lb/> taking some refreshment at an inn in the
                    village,<lb/> which is close by the lake, I again mounted my<lb/> horse, and, in
                    the evening, came to an improving<lb/> town, and took up my quarters at
                        <placeName key="bostw">Bostwick's<lb/> Tavern</placeName>. </p>

                <p>After passing by the <geogName key="lakeow">Lake<lb/> Owasco</geogName>, I
                    arrived at <placeName key="cayug1">Cayuga</placeName>, where I breakfasted<lb/>
                    at a very good inn. <placeName key="cayug1">Cayuga</placeName> is situated at
                    the<lb/> outlet of the lake of that name, where there is a<lb/> bridge over the
                    lake 1700 yards in extent, which<lb/> I passed after paying 13 1/2d. toll. I was
                    informed<lb/> that on the setting in of the frost, the preceding<lb/> winter,
                    more than 1500 sledges, loaded with pro-<lb/>duce, passed this bridge in one
                    day. This lake is<lb/> nearly 40 miles in length, and about 4 in breadth,<lb/>
                    and opens an extensive communication with New-<lb/>York, by joining the
                        <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogName> and <geogName key="nrive">North
                        Rivers</geogName>,<lb/> with the exception of a short portage or
                    carrying-<lb/> place, where the vessels cannot pass. </p>
                <p>In the evening I came to <placeName key="genev">Geneva</placeName>, a
                    handsome<lb/> town, situated on a high ground on the banks of<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogName>. This lake also extends about
                    40<lb/> miles in length, and generally from 3 to 5 miles<lb/> in breadth; and is
                    navigated by sloops. On in-<lb/>quiry I found that land sells here from 13s. 6d.
                    to<lb/> 27s. per acre, though of very good quality. There<lb/>
                    <pb n="145" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_145"/> being a bold shore along this lake, there are,<lb/> as may well be
                    conceived, many beautiful situa-<lb/>tions on its banks. </p>
                <p>This night I lodged at <placeName key="powelt">Powel's Tavern</placeName>, in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="genev">Geneva</placeName>, which is, in every respect, a most
                    excel-<lb/> lent inn, and capacity of accommodating a large<lb/> number of
                    guests. At this inn, I met with an<lb/> agreeable and entertaining young man,
                    with whom<lb/> I spent the evening.</p>

                    General, though an innkeeper,<lb/> stands very high in the estimation of his
                    country-<lb/>men. In the Revolution, though very young, he<lb/> was a Sergeant;

                <p>After leaving <persName key="ghall2">General<lb/> Hall</persName>'s, I crossed
                    the <geogName key="genes2">Genessee River</geogName>, and soon<lb/> came to an
                    Indian village, where I called at one<lb/> or two dwellings, wishing to have
                    some conversa-<lb/> tion with the inhabitants; but we were unable to<lb/> make
                    each other understand.</p>
                <p>Before crossing the river, I passed through<lb/>
                    <placeName key="hartf">Hartford</placeName>, where are several good inns.</p>
                <p>In the course of the day I met with many<lb/> Indians; and after dining at
                    Ganier's Tavern, I<lb/> came to Beamus's Tavern, where I lodged. The<lb/> last 5
                    or 6 miles of my way lay in a line through<lb/> the thick forest; the roads, in
                    many parts where<lb/> the ground is soft, being formed of the straight<lb/>
                    trunks of trees, laid close to each other across the<lb/> road, and then covered
                    with earth or gravel; but<lb/> in some parts the latter is neglected, and the
                    path<lb/> lies over the bare timber.</p>
                <p>At the last-mentioned inn I met with what I had<lb/> often heard of, but seldom,
                    if ever seen, a professed<lb/> atheist, who openly advocated his opinions.
                    To<lb/> all appearance he was sober; yet his arguments<lb/> were extremely weak;
                    indeed the poor man seemed<lb/> to be labouring under great mental
                    darkness.<lb/> Although this was a season of the year in which<lb/> thunder and
                    lightning are not common; yet, it<lb/> was very remarkable, that during the time the<lb/>
                    <pb n="147" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_147"/> atheist was delivering his opinions, the thunder<lb/> rolled over
                    our heads in an awful manner, accom-<lb/> panied with vivid flashes of
                    lightning; and, as we<lb/> were surrounded with an almost boundless forest,<lb/>
                    a most solemn effect was produced. This, how-<lb/> ever, he seemed not to
                    regard. I was not disposed to<lb/> think uncharitably of any one, on account of
                    his opi-<lb/> nions respecting religion; yet I confess I was not a<lb/> little
                    perplexed, in my endeavours to make out what<lb/> could be this man's motives,
                    for propagating his<lb/> cold and comfortless doctrines; and was not able<lb/>
                    to devise any common ground of action, unless it<lb/> were a desire to gain
                    celebrity, even through ab-<lb/> surdity. I am aware that it is not in any
                    man's<lb/> power to command his religious opinions; yet a<lb/> great deal
                    depends on our cultivating, or reject-<lb/>ing such as offer themselves to our
                    notice. In<lb/> considering the character of this poor atheist,<lb/> who I am
                    told, is a man of good moral con-<lb/>duct, I am ready to think that some have
                    suf-<lb/> fered loss, under the apprehension that it is of<lb/> little
                    consequence what our religious opinions are,<lb/> provided a good moral conduct
                    is observed; as if<lb/> religion and morality were the same thing. But,<lb/>
                    alas! notwithstanding a truly religious character<lb/> will ever be found a
                    character of clean moral con-<lb/>duct; yet, as in the case of this deluded
                    individual,<lb/> some moral characters may be found, who can<lb/> even deny the
                    God who made them, and thus shut<lb/>
                    <pb n="148" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_148"/> up the fountain of every mental consolation; yea,<lb/> even of
                    hope itself.</p>

                <p>This day I passed through<lb/>
                    <placeName key="batav">Batavia</placeName>; and, near this place, met an Indian
                    with<lb/> his dog, driving a flock of sheep before him of<lb/> about 30 or 40 in
                    number. In the course of the<lb/> day I met several hunting parties of Indians,
                    and<lb/> came to Vandeventer's Tavern in the evening;<lb/> which I spent with
                    one of the <orgName key="hollco">Holland Company's<lb/> Surveyors</orgName>. He
                    and his companions had been oc-<lb/> cupied in the woods, more than three
                    months,<lb/> and had not in all that time, slept in a house or<lb/> on a bed. He
                    was a young man of stability, very<lb/> agreeable, and well informed. The tract
                    of land<lb/> they were surveying, was purchased by some per-<lb/>sons in
                    Holland, and is therefore called the<lb/> Holland-land-Purchase. It consists of
                    3,500,000<lb/> acres, for which they paid at the rate of 1 1/2d. per<lb/> acre.
                    The principal proprietor is Shimmelpennick.<lb/> This land they are now selling
                    from 9s. to 27s. per<lb/> acre, but purchasers may be accommodated with<lb/> the
                    money remaining at interest, provided they<lb/> settle upon the purchase, and
                    improve the land.<lb/> By their books of surveys, I observed that they<lb/>
                    meted out the tract into divisions and ranges, which<lb/> are numbered; a square
                    of about 10 miles making<lb/>
                    <pb n="149" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_149"/> a township; and these townships being subdivided<lb/> into lots
                    for farms. The maps describe every<lb/> stream and mountain, the quality of the
                    land in<lb/> each division, and the timber upon it, in a very<lb/> neat and
                    accurate stile. This surveyor, by living<lb/> so much in the woods, had acquired
                    a good deal<lb/> of the Indian air in his dress, wearing leggins and<lb/>
                    moccasons, as is the manner of the Indians, with<lb/> whose company he was
                    sometimes obliged to be<lb/> contented.</p>

                <p>This day I passed over a<lb/> large extent of country, of a very unusual
                    appear-<lb/>ance in America. It consisted of what are called<lb/> prairies, or
                    pastures. These are large tracts of<lb/> land, some miles over, where the trees
                    have all<lb/> been leveled with the ground, by some violent<lb/> wind or
                    hurricane; and which the Indians, by oc-<lb/>casionally setting fire to the dry
                    grass, &amp;c. have<lb/> kept clear for the greater convenience of hunting;<lb/>
                    and also for planting and grazing. The large trees<lb/> thus blown down, drag up
                    with their roots consi-<lb/> derable quantities of earth, which, as the tree
                    de-<lb/>cays away leave a little mound, with a cavity on<lb/> that side of it
                    where the earth was torn up. This<lb/> rugged appearance of the earth through
                    the whole<lb/> extent of these prairies, is a convincing proof of<lb/> the
                    manner in which the ground has been cleared.<lb/>
                    <pb n="150" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_150"/> In riding along these pastures, I met several<lb/> parties of
                    Indians, who, from the quantity of their<lb/> baggage, seemed to be pretty
                    wealthy, having<lb/> several loaded horses. Thus far I have not met<lb/> with
                    the least rudeness or improper behaviour<lb/> from these people; though I have
                    several times<lb/> passed individuals, as well as large companies of<lb/> them,
                    when I have been without a companion,<lb/> and might have been an easy prey.</p>

                <p>In riding along yes-<lb/> terday, a few miles from <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo
                        Creek</geogName>, I thought<lb/> I could very distinctly hear the noise of
                    the <geogName key="niagf">Falls<lb/> of Niagara</geogName>, although then about
                    24 miles from<lb/> that stupendous cataract. The distance at which<lb/> the
                    people in these parts say the Falls may be<lb/> heard, when the wind and other
                    concurring cir-<lb/>cumstances are favourable, is almost incredible. I<lb/> met
                    with a reputable looking family, driving a team<lb/> of our fine oxen upon the
                    road, who told me,<lb/> with all the gravity of a man speaking the truth,<lb/>
                    that he sometimes heard them very plainly at his<lb/> residence, 40 miles
                    distant from them; when<lb/> the wind was favourable, or the air calm and<lb/>
                    serene. Last night I came to Crow's tavern in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo Town</placeName>, on <geogName key="buffc1"
                        >Buffalo Creek</geogName>, just upon its<lb/> outlet into <geogName
                        key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>. Crow, the keeper of this<lb/> inn, told me
                    that in cold weather, or when the wind<lb/> suited, the noise of the <geogName
                        key="niagf">Falls</geogName> was generally heard<lb/> in <placeName
                        key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName>; which is a distance of 20 miles from<lb/>
                    them. In this place is commonly a number of<lb/> Indians, many of them being
                    settled in the neigh-<lb/>bourhood, some of whom are accounted clever<lb/>
                    <pb n="152" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_152"/> farmers. I saw one of these, of the name of<lb/>
                    <persName key="litbi1">Little Billy</persName>, a chief, accompanied by his
                    squa, going<lb/> into a merchant's warehouse, with whom they did<lb/> business;
                    and I was told, that this Indian raised<lb/> more horses and horned cattle than
                    any other far-<lb/> mer in the neighbourhood; and had, by this busi-<lb/> ness,
                    acquired considerable property. </p>

                <p>After breakfasting at <placeName key="buffa">Buf-<lb/>falo Town</placeName>, I
                    crossed the Rapids, about three miles<lb/> below <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogName>. These Rapids are a very con-<lb/>siderable River, being at
                    this place nearly one<lb/> mile over, and conveying a vast body of water,<lb/>
                    which passes in its course from Lake Erie<lb/> to Lake Ontario. I observed, as I
                    rode along,<lb/> a number of large fishes that were thrown on<lb/> shore; and
                    saw many ravens hovering about and<lb/> devouring them. In travelling upon the
                    banks of<lb/> the Rapids, for many miles, the roaring of the<lb/> Falls is heard
                    resembling distant thunder. Being<lb/> in Upper Canada, which is under our own
                    govern-<lb/>ment, it felt to me something like being in Eng-<lb/>land, and
                    occasioned a pleasing sensation. Here<lb/> I observed a number of good
                    farm-houses; the<lb/> pastures and the wheat looked remarkably fresh<lb/> and
                    green, and a large fine herd of cattle were<lb/> grazing in the fields. In
                    conversing I found that<lb/> many of the inhabitants are of German or
                    French<lb/> descent. In the afternoon I came to Fenning's<lb/> Tavern at
                        <placeName key="chipp1">Chippaway</placeName>, a town on the Creek of that<lb/>
                    <pb n="153" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_153"/> name. Here is a block-house fortification, at which<lb/> an
                    English garrison is stationed. From the windows<lb/> of this tavern, clouds of
                    mist are seen rising from the<lb/> Falls; and the noise of them is so loud, that
                    a per-<lb/> son seems to be close upon them, although they<lb/> are nearly three
                    miles distant. I was informed by<lb/> several of Fenning's family, that the
                    concussion<lb/> occasioned by the descent of so large a body of<lb/> water, is
                    such, that in a still summer's evening, a<lb/> constant tremor of the earth is
                    perceptible; and<lb/> the loose glass in the windows is so shaken as to<lb/>
                    produce considerable noise.</p>

                <p>I lodged last night at Fen-<lb/> ning's tavern, where I had as good
                    accommoda-<lb/>tion as could be desired. In this family I met<lb/> with a young
                    man, who had his education in our<lb/> society, and is a commissioner or
                    surveyor under<lb/> the English government, for the dispose of lands<lb/> to new
                    settlers. This young man kindly offered<lb/> me his company and assistance, in
                    visiting the<lb/> curiosities in this neighbourhood. However it be-<lb/>ing
                    first day, and there being no meeting near, I<lb/> preferred spending the
                    forenoon alone. There-<lb/>fore, immediately after breakfast, I walked down<lb/>
                    to the Falls by myself; the tremendous noise, with<lb/> the volumes of spray and
                    mist arising from them,<lb/> being a sufficient guide to the spot. The
                    first<lb/> view of this wonderful cataract, is from the prin-<lb/>cipal road,
                    which, though not the most complete,<lb/><pb n="154" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_154"/> is perhaps as beautiful
                    as any; but being from a<lb/> situation which is level with the river above
                    the<lb/> Falls, a considerable part of the cataract is hid from<lb/> the eye.
                    After taking a circuit of about a mile,<lb/> the path leads down a steep
                    precipice, which is<lb/> descended with considerable difficulty, and not<lb/>
                    without the aid of a long ladder, placed there by<lb/> a neighbouring planter,
                    as when for his own con-<lb/> veniency, as for that of strangers.
                    Immediately<lb/> below the cataract, the river is confined between<lb/> two
                    steep rocks that form a deep winding valley,<lb/> through which the waters flow
                    in their course to-<lb/> wards Lake Ontario. This valley is terminated<lb/> by a
                    perpendicular rock of 53 yards in height,<lb/> which runs across, forming angle
                    pointing up<lb/> the river, over which this vast body of water
                    pre-<lb/>cipitates itself with astonishing rapidity, and with<lb/> a noise so
                    tremendous that it can scarcely be de-<lb/>scribed. On the top of the rock is a
                    small island,<lb/> which divides the cataract into tracts, and in<lb/> such a
                    manner that the greater part of the water<lb/> pours over the rocks at the
                    extreme head of the<lb/> valley; and the rest on one side of it. A little<lb/>
                    above, opposite <placeName key="chipp1">Chippaway</placeName>, the river is two
                    miles<lb/> over; but directly above the <geogName key="niagf">Falls</geogName>
                    it narrows to<lb/> about a mile in breadth. I was informed by<lb/>
                    <persName key="jelic1">Joseph Ellicot</persName> and his brother, at whose house
                    I<lb/> lodged, that they had twice measured the falls, and<lb/> found them to be
                    158 feet in height, and about<lb/> 1800 yards in width from the opposite edges of<lb/>
                    <pb n="155" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_155"/> the river<note resp="transcr" rend="asterisk">This includes both
                        Falls and the intersecting<lb/> island, which is about 450 yards
                        over.</note> I was told by the ferryman, that about<lb/> 16 miles above the
                    Falls, the river was nearly one<lb/> mile in width, and that, in the middle, it
                    was 40<lb/> feet in depth; and, in common, the stream ran<lb/> at the rate of
                    six miles in the hour. If this is<lb/> really the case, and I have no cause to
                    doubt it,<lb/> the quantity of water passing over the Falls, and<lb/>
                    continually suspended between the top and bot-<lb/>tom, may be more than 400,000
                    tons. If the<lb/> additional height and velocity, gained by a fall<lb/> of 158
                    feet, be added, the weight of these prodi-<lb/>gious columns of water would
                    exceed three mil-<lb/>lions of tons. Such an enormous specific gravity<lb/>
                    falling at once into the gulf below may bring the<lb/> accounts or the Falls
                    being heard, under favour-<lb/>able circumstances, at the distance of 40 or
                    50<lb/> miles, within the limits of credibility <note resp="transcr"
                        rend="asterisk">Arrowsmith in his map of the United States,<lb/> says,
                            <q>this column of water is supposed to descend into<lb/> the column
                            about 65 feet.</q> He also observes, <q>It is said by<lb/> those who

                            A person having descended, however,<lb/> may go to the bottom of the
                            Falls and take shelter behind the<lb/> torrent, between the falling
                            water and the precipice; where<lb/> there is a space sufficient to
                            contain a number of persons,<lb/> in perfect safety; and where

                <p>Having reached the bottom of the precipice,<lb/> and approached as near to the
                    cataract, as I could,<lb/> with apparent safety, I sat down, and spent
                    about<lb/> two hours in contemplating this astonishing natural<lb/> curiosity,
                    which is said to be the greatest cataract<lb/> in the world. The tremendous roar
                    arising from<lb/> the Falls, added to the awful sublimity of the<lb/> spectacle
                    of such an uncommon body of water<lb/> rushing headlong from the rock, with the
                    beautiful<lb/> surrounding perspectives altogether form a scene<lb/> which it is
                    impossible to describe. As the morning<lb/> was bright and clear, a beautiful
                    rainbow was<lb/> constantly observable in the clouds of mist and<lb/> spray,
                    that are continually rising from the water<lb/> below. Here I held my forenoon
                    meeting, and<lb/> though no words were uttered, it could scarcely be<lb/> called
                    a silent meeting; the objects before me<lb/> loudly proclaiming the power and
                    majesty of the<lb/> Great First Cause and Creator of all things.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon I returned to the inn, and, after<lb/> dinner, was invited by
                    the commanding officer of<lb/> the English garrison to drink tea with him,
                    and<lb/> his wife and family, in the fort. I accepted his<lb/> invitation, and
                    spent the evening with them very<lb/> pleasantly. This officer, whose name is
                        <persName key="tall1">Tallant</persName>,<lb/> had spent some time in
                    Sheffield, a few years<lb/> back, and had married his wife at Liverpool;
                    she<lb/> is an agreeable young woman, and well acquainted<lb/> with some friends
                    of Liverpool. They had a fine<lb/> child with them, and upon the whole seemed hap-<lb/>
                    <pb n="157" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_157"/>pier than could be expected in such a situation.<lb/> They behaved
                    with great kindness to me; and it<lb/> appeared a gratification to them to
                    entertain an<lb/> Englishman.</p>

                <p>This morning I had the com-<lb/> pany of W. S. a minister of our society,
                    belonging<lb/> to Pelham monthly meeting, in this neighbour-<lb/> hood. He
                    kindly invited me to his house, to spend<lb/> a few days with him, but I could
                    not conveniently<lb/> accept his invitation. In the forenoon I paid<lb/> another
                    visit to the Falls, and it being a dark cloudy<lb/> day, the whole view had a
                    more gloomy and solemn<lb/> aspect. There being none of the glare and
                    glitter<lb/> of the sunshine, the eye could rest steadily upon<lb/> it; and,
                    having a pencil and paper with me, I<lb/> took a sketch of the scene. </p>
                <p>In the evening I came to D. P.'s of <orgName key="blacm">Black Creek<lb/>
                        meeting</orgName>, at whose house I lodged. This is a plea-<lb/>sant
                    situation, on the banks of <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>; and<lb/>
                    D. P.'s establishment presents an agreeable spe-<lb/>cimen of a Back Wood
                    family. In the room<lb/> where we breakfasted, was a loom for weaving;<lb/> in
                    another apartment were spinning wheels, and<lb/> some of the girls actively
                    platting straw and mak-<lb/> ing it into hats and bonnets for the family.
                    In<lb/> addition to our tea and toast, we had excellent<lb/> broiled fish taken
                    in the Lake, where they easily<lb/>
                    <pb n="158" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_158"/> procure great quantities. These persons were so<lb/> situated,
                    that, in their own family, they had the<lb/> means of procuring nearly all the
                    necessaries, and<lb/> even many of the luxuries of life. It was a very<lb/>
                    beautiful sight, to see ten fine orderly children<lb/> sitting round the table
                    with their father and mo-<lb/> ther, who were still in the prime of life, and
                    living<lb/> independently of the uncertainties of commerce.<lb/> The eldest
                    daughter appeared to be about 16 years<lb/> old. One of the sons, who was but a
                    boy, enter-<lb/> tained me with full account of his having lately killed<lb/> a
                    bear, as it was in pursuit of his father's hogs.<lb/> The English government, in
                    order to encourage<lb/> the settlement of Upper Canada, grant to new<lb/>
                    settlers, 200 acres of land for heads of families,<lb/> and 50 acres additional
                    for each child; reserving<lb/> to the crown the minerals and the white
                    pines.<lb/> D. P. gave me the perusal of his grants, from<lb/> which I gathered
                    the conditions. Some little ex-<lb/> pense attends the grants in the fees of
                    office,<lb/> though but trifling, and their tax amount to a<lb/> very small sum
                    per annum for each 100 acres.</p>

                <p>I left <placeName key="blacc">Black Creek</placeName>; and the<lb/> morning being
                    clear and calm, the scenery around<lb/> was beautiful. After riding about 10
                    miles on the<lb/> banks of <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>, I came to
                        <placeName key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>, where<lb/> I got some
                    refreshment at the inn, and proceeding<lb/> a little further, I got into the
                    ferryboat, in com-<lb/>pany with an old drunken Indian, and his squaw.<lb/>
                    <pb n="159" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_159"/> These poor creatures I had seen the morning be-<lb/> fore, at the
                    inn, endeavouring to persuade Fenning,<lb/> the landlord, to exchange spirituous
                    liquors for a<lb/> piece of printed callico, which the Indian had re-<lb/>
                    ceived as a present from the agent of the British<lb/> Government in Canada. I
                    was glad to observe<lb/> that Fenning had the uprightness to refuse taking<lb/>
                    advantage of this poor creature, which he might<lb/> easily have done, as the
                    Indian was then in a state<lb/> of intoxication, and scarcely able to utter
                    any<lb/> thing but <q>Whisko,</q> the name he gave to spirits.<lb/> I was told
                    in Canada, that many thousand pounds<lb/> per annum are expended in presents to
                    the Indians,<lb/> in order to insure their friendship in time of war;<lb/> and
                    that the greater part of these presents are ex-<lb/>changed for spirituous
                    liquors, which they use to<lb/> great excess, many times to the loss of their
                    lives,<lb/> and always at the expence of their health. </p>
                <p>After crossing the Rapids, I passed through the<lb/> Prairies, or large open
                    plains, already described.<lb/> In the evening I slept in an inn kept by a
                    person<lb/> called Esquire Ransom. This is the title given<lb/> to all justices
                    of the peace, and my landlord was<lb/> one, and a miller also. It seemed to me a
                    little<lb/> strange, that men in such low stations should be<lb/> appointed
                    magistrates. On making a remark to<lb/> this effect, they also thought it very
                    strange that<lb/> we should measure peoples understanding by their<lb/> wealth.

                <p>I travelled this day mostly<lb/> through the woods, and met with some Indian<lb/>
                    hunters, who behaved with civility. On one large<lb/> tree I saw an Indian
                    painting that had been re-<lb/> cently done. The figures were, Indians,
                    bows<lb/> and arrows, and deer with arrows pierced through<lb/> the neck. The
                    colours were chiefly black and<lb/> red, upon the white ground of the tree where
                    the<lb/> bark was taken off. In passing through these<lb/> woods I saw divers
                    very fine and lofty pines; some<lb/> of them were 12 or 14 feet in
                    circumference, and,<lb/> I suppose, not less than 170 feet in hight. I saw<lb/>
                    many which had been blown down, and, in their<lb/> fall, had, with their roots,
                    torn up mounds of<lb/> earth of considerable height. At night I came to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="batav">Batavia</placeName>, and took up my quarters at the house
                    of<lb/> J. E. and his brother, where I was kindly and<lb/> generously
                    entertained. We had part of a fine<lb/> haunch of venison for supper, which they
                    told me<lb/> they had bought of the Indians at 1 1/2d. per lb. and<lb/> which
                    was the regular sum paid tor the best parts<lb/> of the fattest deer. </p>
                <p>In the centre of a good room, in which I slept,<lb/> was fixed one of the most
                    beautiful and curious<lb/> clocks I have ever seen. It was in the form of<lb/>
                    an elegant mahogany pillar, on the capital of which<lb/> were four faces. On one
                    of them was an orrery,<lb/> shewing the motions of the earth and planets<lb/>
                    round the sun. On another face were marked<lb/>
                    <pb n="161" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_161"/> the hours and minutes; and on the third face were<lb/> marked the
                    names of 24 musical tunes, with a<lb/> pointer in the centre, which, being
                    placed against<lb/> any name, repeated that tune every quarter, until<lb/> the
                    pointer was moved to another. On the fourth<lb/> face was seen, through the
                    glass, the curious<lb/> machinery of the clock. The value set upon this<lb/>
                    ingenious piece of mechanism was 1000 dollars,<lb/> or 225l. The cabinet work of
                    the casing, as well<lb/> as the engravings and paintings about it, and also<lb/>
                    the movements, although done in a beautiful and<lb/> workman-like manner, had
                    all been executed<lb/> by men, none of whom had served an apprentice-<lb/>ship
                    to their respective lines of business. The<lb/> mechanism was executed by the
                    grandfather of<lb/> the kind friend in whose house it stands. This<lb/> family
                    are remarkable for ingenuity, and have ren-<lb/>dered essential services to this
                    country, by the<lb/> improvements they have made in the machinery<lb/> of flour
                    mills. One of their progenitors had been<lb/> clock-maker to a King of England,
                    and was con-<lb/>sidered a first-rate mechanic in his day. Thus<lb/>
                    propensities and talents sometimes run in families<lb/> from one generation to
                    another. </p>

                <p>After breakfast my hospita-<lb/> ble friends shewed me into the land office of
                    the<lb/> Holland purchase, where every thing is arranged<lb/> in great order;
                    and several clerks and surveyors<lb/>
                    <pb n="162" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_162"/> are employed. At one of the desks I saw<lb/> the surveyor whom I
                    had met with a few days<lb/> before, in his Indian habiliments, just come
                    out<lb/> of the woods, in which he had been surveying.<lb/> He was now
                    transformed into a smart looking<lb/> clerk, so that I scarcely knew him. In the
                    fore-<lb/>noon I left <placeName key="batav">Batavia</placeName>, and passed
                    several hunting<lb/> parties of Indians. Yesterday, while breakfasting<lb/> at
                        <placeName key="vande">Vandeventer</placeName>'s, I observed them sending
                    out a<lb/> boy to a neighbouring settlement of these people,<lb/> to buy Indian
                    corn; and, on inquiring the cause,<lb/> I was told that in the settlements of
                    the white<lb/> people thereabouts, the corn harvest had generally<lb/> failed.
                    This not having been the case with the<lb/> Indians, the white people were
                    therefore indebted<lb/> to them for support that season. The mistress of<lb/>
                    <placeName key="vande">Vandeventer's Tavern</placeName>, who is a sober
                    religious<lb/> woman, informed me that she sometimes employed<lb/> the Indian
                    females in needle work, at which some<lb/> of them arc exceedingly clever. On my
                    inquiring<lb/> how it happened that they decreased in numbers<lb/> so fast, she
                    told me that she often had conversation<lb/> on this subject, with the females
                    she employed;<lb/> and, on close inquiry, they would freely confess<lb/> that
                    they used various unnatural means to prevent<lb/> an increase. On the landlady
                    pleading with them,<lb/> and endeavouring to convince them of the sinful-<lb/>
                    ness of their practices, they would sometimes<lb/> reply, that it was impossible
                    for them to carry<lb/> about a child, and also use the skins, &amp;c. which their<lb/>
                    <pb n="163" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_163"/> husbands procured in the woods; and which they<lb/> were always
                    forced to carry in the hunting season.<lb/> Such is the affecting situation of
                    these poor Indian<lb/> mothers.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon I came to Capt. Ganser's Ta-<lb/>vern, in approaching which, I
                    observed a young<lb/> Indian female, who was standing not far from the<lb/>
                    road, apparently full of trouble. On coming near<lb/> the house, I heard a noise
                    very much like the<lb/> growling of a wild beast; and on looking into the<lb/>
                    house, I saw a stout young Indian singing a kind<lb/> of war song in his own
                    language. The master of<lb/> the inn told me that he was much intoxicated,
                    and<lb/> had been beating his wife, the female I had just<lb/> seen. She had,
                    notwithstanding, taken from him<lb/> his tomahawk and scalping knife, and put
                    them<lb/> out of his way; and I was informed that it is the<lb/> general
                    practice of the Indian females, to take<lb/> away these instruments of death,
                    whenever there<lb/> is any appearance of intoxication. Even the little<lb/>
                    girls are so instructed, that whenever they see the<lb/> men in the way of being
                    intoxicated, they will slily<lb/> take away these instruments and hide them
                    until<lb/> the drunken fit is over.</p>
                <p>After leaving this place I passed by a settlement<lb/> of white people, who were
                    mostly Scotch High-<lb/>landers. Here I heard a company of drunken<lb/> Indians
                    singing their war song; and, passing on a<lb/>
                    <pb n="164" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_164"/> few miles farther I overtook a company of Indian<lb/> women with
                    their children. The women were<lb/> disposed to talk with me, but I could not
                    under-<lb/> stand a word they said, except <foreign>scos</foreign>,
                        <foreign>scos </foreign>, and <foreign>too<lb/> scoss</foreign>; the first
                    of which I knew meant good, and<lb/> the latter, not good. Not long after I
                    parted with<lb/> them I came to <placeName key="canaw">Cannawagas</placeName>,
                    an Indian village,<lb/> near the Genessee river, which I crossed, and, in<lb/>
                    the evening came to Osmar's Tavern in <placeName key="hartf2"
                        >Hartford</placeName>,<lb/> where I spent the evening with two young
                    men,<lb/> who had also been on a visit to the Falls of Niagara. </p>

                    thought it could not be less than<lb/> 4 or 5 feet long, as its tail trailed

                    about 8 miles on the banks of <geogName key="lakese">Lake
                    Seneca</geogName>;<lb/> and lodged at Captain Knight's tavern, a beautiful<lb/>
                    situation on the banks of the Lake. The landlord<lb/> informed me that he had
                    been a long time in the<lb/> service of <persName key="daffl1">Daniel
                        Ofley</persName>, a friend of Philadelphia,<lb/> of whom he spoke with

                        Seneca</geogName>, on which are many<lb/> pleasing prospects. I had,

                    postmaster<lb/> Newtown; and, in the evening we came to Ely's<lb/> tavern in
                        <placeName key="hecto">Hector township</placeName>. One son of our

                    the town-ship, after its settlement;<lb/> he appeared to be about 12 years old.
                    This part<lb/> abounds with deer and black squirrels, of which<lb/> sort of
                    provisions they had plenty in the house; and<lb/> we had some for supper. The
                    squirrels were very<lb/> fat, much more so than I could have expected.</p>

                <p>We left Ely's tavern early, and<lb/> passing through a romantic country, where we
                    had a<lb/> view of one of the prettiest water falls I had ever<lb/> seen. It
                    descended, as by an easy flight of steps, down<lb/> the declivity of a mountain,
                    at the foot of which<lb/> is <geogName key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogName>. I
                    was told that both the white<lb/> inhabitants and Indians kill a great many deer
                    by<lb/> hunting them down into the Lake, on which they<lb/> continue to pursue
                    them in a boat or canoe. The<lb/>
                    <pb n="166" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_166"/> pursuers soon overtake the deer, throw a halter<lb/> over the
                    horns, and dragging it to the side of the<lb/> vessel, take the life of the poor
                    animal with a large<lb/> knife, and then drag it on shore. </p>
                <p>About noon we reached <placeName key="catha">Catherines</placeName>, a village
                    at<lb/> the end of <geogName key="lakese">Lake Seneca</geogName>; at this
                    village there is a<lb/> wharf, and some business is carried on in vessels
                    of<lb/> about 50 tons burden. After taking some refresh-<lb/>ment, we passed on
                    through <geogName key="catswamp">Catherine's Swamp</geogName>,<lb/> a deep
                    narrow valley with mountains on each hand,<lb/> covered with lofty trees. Here,
                    as the evening<lb/> approached the valley resounded with the howling<lb/> of
                    wolves; the sound very much resembling the<lb/> noise of a number of large dogs,
                    howling as they<lb/> sometimes do in the night, or on hearing the sound<lb/> of
                    the horn. My companion, by way of encou-<lb/>ragement, informed me that he had
                    never heard of<lb/> an instance of either a wolf or a bear attacking a<lb/> man,
                    except in case of themselves or their young<lb/> being first wounded; and from
                    what I can learn,<lb/> I believe this statement to be correct. </p>
                <p>This evening we came to <placeName key="newto2">Newtown</placeName> and had<lb/>
                    good accommodations at Ellis's tavern, where I<lb/> spent some time with a
                    person of the name of<lb/> Goldbride, who informed me that he was the first<lb/>
                    person who had attempted the navigation of the<lb/> Shoumonge into the <geogName
                        key="susqu">Susquehanna</geogName>, and so down<lb/> to <placeName

                <p>I left <placeName key="newto2">Newtown</placeName>, and, tra-<lb/>velling along a

                        key="winc1">Esquire Wincope</persName>, where I<lb/> got some refreshment.
                    The innkeeper was not<lb/> only a justice of the peace, but also a
                    watchmaker.<lb/> Having broken the glass of my watch, he put a<lb/> brass cap
                    over the face as none of his glasses<lb/> would suit. He appeared to be a very
                    ingenious<lb/> artist; and as a Magistrate, possessed a good<lb/> share of
                    useful knowledge. I perceived an edition<lb/> of Burn's Justice on the shelf,
                    with his watch-mak-<lb/>ing tools, and therefore I suppose he administered<lb/>
                    justice according to law. Towards evening I<lb/> came to <placeName key="tiogp"
                        >Tioga Point</placeName>, where is the junction of<lb/> the <geogName

                        >Susquehanna</geogName>; and took<lb/> up my quarters at Doctor Hopkin's, an

                    was bending my course. This<lb/> night I lodged at the Doctor's, and, next
                    morn-<lb/> ing set out for <placeName key="elkla">Elklands</placeName>. After

                <p>This morning I left <placeName key="dothe">Dother-<lb/>ly's</placeName>, and rode
                    many miles through the woods, with-<lb/> out seeing one habitation, or meeting
                    one in-<lb/> dividual. The land in general is of good quality,<lb/> and the
                    forest trees are mostly beech, hiccory, oak,<lb/> a species of pine, called
                    hemlock, and the sugar<lb/> maple. From the last, considerable quantities
                    of<lb/> sugar are made; and I saw several sugar camps,<lb/> fenced in, where the
                    sap is collected in small<lb/> wooden troughs, about two feet long,
                    coarsely<lb/> made with the hatchet, and capable of containing<lb/> one or two
                    gallons each. One of these troughs is<lb/> placed at the foot of each tree, and
                    above it a hole<lb/> is pierced, with an inch and a half auger. In the<lb/> hole
                    is fixed a spout, about one foot long, made<lb/> of the elder tree, with the
                    pith taken out. As the<lb/> sap is collected, it is carried to the boilers,
                    which<lb/> are fixed in the camp. Some farmers not only col-<lb/>lect sufficient
                    sugar and treacle for their own<lb/> use, but have several hundred pounds weight
                    to<lb/> dispose of to the grocers. After travelling about<lb/> 12 miles, I came
                    to a habitation called <placeName key="eldri">Eldridge's<lb/>
                    Tavern</placeName>. The situation of this inn was very soli-<lb/> tary and
                    romantic, in the midst of a very extensive<lb/> forest. The mistress of the
                    house told me that<lb/> her husband and she had lately emigrated from<lb/>
                    London, where they had carried on business in<lb/> Longacre, more than 14
                    years.</p>
                <p>In the course of this day I came safe to my<lb/> relation's at <placeName
                        key="elkla">Elklands</placeName>, and found his family well.<lb/>
                    <pb n="169" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_169"/> The situation he has chosen is very solitary; his<lb/> nearest
                    neighbour being about one mile off; but<lb/> there are several at about that
                    distance; and some<lb/> of them being of our society, they have united<lb/> and
                    built a meeting-house near them. </p>

                    very few acres, but which<lb/> appeared to be well managed, and very
                    produc-<lb/>tive. He had just nailed up the skin of a large<lb/> bear, against
                    the side of his house. He had shot the<lb/> beast, whilst in the act of seizing
                    one of his hogs,<lb/> having been led to the scene of action by the<lb/> shrieks
                    of the poor animal, while under the rude<lb/> embraces of the bear. By <persName

                    <pb n="170" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_170"/> tables were quickly turned in favor of the hog,<lb/> which was
                    rescued, and was in a fair way of re-<lb/>covering from its wounds. </p>

                    was 4 yards in circumference,<lb/> and 50 yards in length; yet it was of but

                <p>I spent this day at W. E's,<lb/> who appeared to be much employment as an
                    agent<lb/> in the sale and purchase of lands in these parts;<lb/> and, I
                    understand, he has, by this means, acquired a<lb/> large property. A sale of 100
                    acres of land was<lb/> made while I was here. The estate sold for about<lb/>
                    330l. sterling, with a tan-yard and some buildings<lb/> and other improvements
                    thereon. It was considered<lb/> well worth the money; although, 10 or 15
                    years<lb/> ago, 50l. would have been thought a good price<lb/> for the land; it
                    being 150 miles inland from Phi-<lb/> ladelphia; but there are now many good
                    houses<lb/> and plantations scattered up and down in the<lb/> neighbourhood; and
                    the roads are generally in<lb/> good order. </p>

                    <pb n="173" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_173"/> Observing something very wild and singular in the<lb/> countenance
                    of an infant, which the friend's wife<lb/> was nursing on her lap, I inquired if
                    it was her<lb/> own; on which she informed me it was the child of<lb/> an

                <p>After breakfast I attended <orgName key="meetcat">Cattawessy monthly<lb/>

                    endeavour-<lb/>ing to dispose of their property at <placeName key="catta"

                    him, when at<lb/> J. L.'s. A neighbour of P.'s told us, that, some-<lb/>time

                    alarmed by a large wolf<lb/> running by him. On presenting his gun, he
                    observed<lb/> a considerable number following after as fast as<lb/> they could
                    run, being in all 17 large wolves. They<lb/> all passed by without taking the
                    least notice of<lb/> him; however he fired at the last of them, and<lb/> killed
                    him on the spot; the rest pursuing their<lb/>

                <p>In that neighbourhood many friends had sold<lb/> their plantations, and had gone

                    through<lb/> a rough, stony country, very little of it being in a<lb/> state of
                    cultivation; but the sides of the mountains<lb/> were mostly covered with the

                    along the vallies. At the tavern where I dined, there<lb/> was a hunter who, the

                    bushy beard, which extended a considerable way<lb/> down his breast. On

                    expected to have heard some motive<lb/> assigned that had at least the

                    ther grave yard, set apart by Friends, for the use<lb/> of people of other
                    persuasions who incline to bury<lb/> in it. For many years past, a number of
                    the<lb/> neighbouring families had availed themselves of<lb/> the privilege; but
                    not satisfied with burying only,<lb/> they had taken down nearly the whole of
                    the stones<lb/> which composed the wall that separated the two<lb/> grave yards;
                    and had placed them at the head and<lb/> feet of the graves, by way of
                    tomb-stones, and thus<lb/> the two burying groups had nearly become one.<lb/>
                    Many Friends of the Preparative Meeting thought<lb/> it was necessary to build
                    up the partition wall, whilst<lb/> others were for having the remains of this
                    wall<lb/> entirely taken away. However, as it appeared on<lb/> discussion, that
                    persons of other persuasions were<lb/> in the practice of using certain
                    ceremonies at<lb/> their burials, and of erecting tomb-stones, &amp;c. it<lb/>
                    was at length concluded that it would be right to<lb/> rebuild the wall, in
                    order that the peculiar testi-<lb/>monies of Friends, in these respects, might be<lb/>
                    <pb n="180" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_180"/> more clearly manifested; and the wall was accord-<lb/>ingly

                <p>In the year 1806, the time when the note was<lb/> handed to me, the numbers in

                <p>In conversation with H. B. he<lb/> related to me an affecting narrative of a
                    black boy,<lb/> who came under the observation of his brother J. R.<lb/> and
                    resided near his dwelling at Lewis-Town, in<lb/> Delaware State. It happened
                    that the master of<lb/>
                    <pb n="181" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_181"/> this poor lad had missed a piece of leather, and he<lb/> charges
                    the boy, who was his slave, with stealing<lb/> it. The boy denied the charge.
                    However, as<lb/> the master was unable to discover what was be-<lb/>come of the
                    leather, and looked upon the denial<lb/> of the charge as a thing of course, he
                    was very<lb/> much irritated that he was unable to bring any proof<lb/> against
                    the lad. In order to extort confession, the<lb/> master tied him up by the
                    hands, a considerable<lb/> height from the ground, and fixed a heavy piece<lb/>
                    of wood (a fence rail) to his feet. In this situa-<lb/> tion he beat the poor
                    boy in so unmerciful a man-<lb/>ner, that he died under the torture thus
                    cruelly<lb/> inflicted by his brutal master. Scarcely had the<lb/> poor little
                    innocent breathed his last, under<lb/> these torments, before the master's son,
                    smitten<lb/> with remorse on being the occasion of such<lb/> dreadful cruelties,
                    confessed that it was himself<lb/> who had stolen the leather, for which the
                    poor<lb/> little slave had just paid the forfeit of his life.<lb/> However void
                    of the feelings of humanity, it may<lb/> well be supposed, that this
                    hard-hearted master<lb/> was not a little mortified at having wantonly put<lb/>
                    to death a valuable slave; but, such was the pro-<lb/>tection which that State
                    afforded these oppressed<lb/> fellow-creatures, that the master escaped
                    punish-<lb/>ment, as is commonly the case on occasions of<lb/> murder committed
                    by the whites on their black<lb/> slaves. </p>

                <p>On a retrospect of my tra-<lb/> vels in this continent, I could not avoid
                    recalling<lb/> to mind the beauty and grandeur of the surround-<lb/>ing scenery,
                    which I have so often admired; whe-<lb/> ther in looking down from the Allegany
                    Mountains<lb/> upon vast forests, extending, on every hand, as far<lb/> as the
                    eye can reach; or in wandering along the<lb/> banks of those extensive lakes in
                    the Genessee<lb/> Country, and Upper Canada, in the midst of<lb/> which, the
                    stupendous cataract of Niagara stuns<lb/> the ear. Equally impressive was the
                    scene in<lb/> sailing on those majestic rivers, the Delaware,<lb/> the Hudson,
                    the Patowmack, or the Susquehanna,<lb/> whose ever-varying banks open prospects
                    extremely<lb/> wild and beautiful; or in traversing those almost<lb/> boundless
                    forests which still remain in an unculti-<lb/>vated state, where I often beheld
                    the native Indian<lb/> families rambling in search of game. In all these<lb/>
                    changing scenes, however striking and impressive,<lb/> the recollection of my
                    near connexions at home<lb/> was almost ever with me; and the remembrance<lb/>
                    of these tender ties induced a short address to my<lb/> wife and family, which
                    led me to exhibit the ef-<lb/> fects of divine love in a few additional
                    stanzas.<lb/> Though they may have little to recommend them,<lb/> I insert the
                    lines in this place:--</p>

                <p>I spent this day at <placeName key="phila">Philadel-<lb/>phia</placeName>. In
                    crossing the floating bridge at the upper<lb/> ferry, I observed the people
                    engaged in a singular<lb/> kind of harvest, being employed in breaking up<lb/>
                    and taking away large quantities of ice, to lay up<lb/> for summer use. Those
                    who have never visited<lb/> warm climates, can scarcely conceive how
                    pleasant<lb/> the use of ice is, for various purposes of the table,<lb/> in the

                <p>In crossing the <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> on<lb/> the floating
                    bridge, at the upper ferry, I passed a<lb/> Negro boy apparently about 12 years
                    of age.<lb/> Round his neck an iron collar was locked, and<lb/> from each side
                    of it an iron bow passed over his<lb/> head. His dress was a light linsey jacket
                    and<lb/> trowsers, without hat, shoes, or stockings. Soon<lb/> after passing the
                    boy, whom I supposed to be a<lb/> runaway slave, I met a person of whom I
                    inquired<lb/> the reason of the boy is having so much iron about<lb/> him. The
                    man replied that the boy was his, and<lb/> was so often running away that he had
                    used that<lb/> method to prevent him. </p>

                <p>After having passed several<lb/> days at <placeName key="merio"
                        >Merion</placeName>, chiefly in writing to my family<lb/>
                    <pb n="185" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_185"/> and connexions, I went this day to <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/> and forwarded various letters and papers to
                    Eng-<lb/> land. Afterwards I dined at J. A.'s, an English-<lb/> man, who had
                    often kindly invited me to his house.<lb/> He had been sent to this country by
                    D. B. on<lb/> business. J. A. gave me an account of singular<lb/> preservation
                    experienced by the ship's company<lb/> in crossing the Atlantic, when more than
                    500<lb/> miles from land. His narrative was nearly as<lb/> follows:--Lying awake
                    early one morning, he was<lb/> alarmed by the people's continuing a long time
                    at<lb/> the pump. About five o'clock the Captain came<lb/> down and informed him
                    that the ship had sprung<lb/> so considerable a leak, that he was fearful
                    the<lb/> consequence would be serious, for the water gained<lb/> fast upon them;
                    that in all probability it would not<lb/> be many hours before the vessel would
                    sink, and<lb/> that there was no alternative but taking to the long-<lb/>boat.
                    Preparations were accordingly made to<lb/> leave the ship, by providing the few
                    stores and<lb/> necessaries they were able to stow in the boat.<lb/> While this
                    was doing the water increased so rapidly,<lb/> that, early in the forenoon, it
                    filled the lower hold<lb/> and began to make its appearance on the cabin<lb/>
                    floor. About noon all were under the absolute ne-<lb/>cessity of leaving the
                    ship, from an expectation she<lb/> would go down every moment. With this awful
                    pro-<lb/> spect before them, the ship's company committed<lb/> themselves to the
                    waves, with scarcely a ray of hope<lb/>
                    <pb n="186" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_186"/> of ever reaching the land. The afternoon was spent with<lb/> heavy
                    hearts, being every moment in danger of hav-<lb/>ing their boat overset or
                    filled with water. When<lb/> the darkness of the night came on, it added to
                    the<lb/> horror of their situation. However, soon after<lb/> it was dark, about
                    eight o'clock, the Captain stood<lb/> up, and being stiff with long sitting in a
                    confined<lb/> posture, stretched himself out, with his face to-<lb/> wards that
                    part of the horizon, where the moon<lb/> was at that moment rising and casting a
                    stream of<lb/> light along the surface of the waters. This afforded<lb/> him an
                    opportunity of discovering a vessel which,<lb/> providentially, at that very
                    time, was passing be-<lb/> tween them and the moon just as she rose above
                    the<lb/> waves. The prospect of so unexpected a deliver-<lb/>ance, gave such new
                    strength to the poor sailors<lb/> at the oars, that, in a short time they came
                    up<lb/> with the ship, and were all taken safely on board. </p>
                <p>It is difficult to describe the feelings of a grate-<lb/>ful mind, on an occasion
                    like this; but from such<lb/> an event, we may all draw this useful lesson:
                    not<lb/> to be too much discouraged even under the most<lb/> adverse
                    circumstances of life. </p>

                        <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, which was held in the
                    new<lb/> meeting-house, a very handsome brick building,<lb/> about 50 yards in
                    length and proportionably broad.<lb/> It cost nearly 6000l. This meeting-house
                    is so con-<lb/> structed, that both men and women keep their seats<lb/> when the
                    meetings for worship close, which are held<lb/> previously to proceeding to
                    their respective busi-<lb/> ness. The partition which divides the house
                    into<lb/> two parts, is so constructed, that it winds round a<lb/> windlass with
                    flat sides. The pannels of the par-<lb/> tition are joined to teach other by
                    hinges; are so<lb/> proportioned that they wrap round the windlass as<lb/> truly
                    and regularly as a piece of canvas; and are<lb/> so nicely managed, that in
                    winding up or letting<lb/> down, they make no more noise than a common<lb/>
                    curtain. It is obvious that the first range of pan-<lb/>nels at the top, next to
                    the windlass, must be the<lb/>
                    <pb n="188" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_188"/> narrowest; and that they must gradually increase<lb/> in breadth
                    to the lowest range, otherwise they<lb/> could not wrap regularly round the
                    axle. The<lb/> gradual decrease in the breadth of the pannels has<lb/> a very
                    pretty effect, when the shutters are down;<lb/> and, contrary to my expectation,
                    I did not observe<lb/> that the meeting suffered any inconveniency from<lb/> the
                    voices of the women, in the other division of<lb/> the house. </p>

                <p>This day I visited a friend, his<lb/> wife, and family, who in company with
                    several<lb/> others had lately emigrated from the neighbour-<lb/>hood of Pyrmont
                    in Germany. Their object in<lb/> coming to America, was, that they and their
                    chil-<lb/> dren might have more of the company of friends.<lb/> As the wages of
                    the poor are very low in that part<lb/> of Germany, not exceeding 3d. or 4d. per
                    day,<lb/> and the necessaries of life are high in proportion,<lb/> few labourers
                    there can afford to have any thing<lb/> better than coarse rye or barley bread,
                    sprinkled<lb/> with a little salt, to their tea or coffee; and these<lb/>
                    Germans, being all labouring people in low cir-<lb/>cumstances, found a great
                    alteration in their situ-<lb/> ation every way, and appeared very thankful
                    for<lb/> the change. </p>

                <p>In the course of the day I vi-<lb/> sited a family of friends, who had lately
                    emigrated<lb/> from Amsterdam, of the name of Poppeleim, and<lb/>
                    <pb n="189" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_189"/> who had come to this country with the same views<lb/> as the
                    Germans just mentioned; but, being men<lb/> of property, were engaged in
                    business. These<lb/> friends having been eye witnesses of the ravages of<lb/>
                    war, which of late have so desolated some of the<lb/> finest countries in
                    Europe, often expressed their<lb/> thankfulness, in broken English, that they
                    were<lb/> permitted thus to sit down in a land, where peace<lb/> and plenty so
                    generally prevailed. One of the last<lb/> mentioned family, of the name of
                        <persName key="vpopp1">Valentine</persName>, a man<lb/> of a very delicate
                    constitution, and who had suf-<lb/> fered a great deal through bad health, and
                    the<lb/> almost constant state of alarm his country had<lb/> been kept under for
                    years past, by contending<lb/> armies, used sometimes to say to his brothers:<lb/>
                    <said who="vpopp1">How thankful ought we now to feel for being<lb/> thus placed
                        amongst friends: we can sleep peace-<lb/> fully in our beds, and, rising in
                        the morning, we<lb/> can pursue our business without interruption or<lb/>
                        alarm; and can sit down in a land of plenty, eating<lb/> our bread in
                        quietness and peace.</said> This evening<lb/> I supped with I. P. an English
                    friend, who some<lb/> years back had emigrated from York, and is now<lb/> well
                    settled in business here. </p>

                <p>I left E. W's hospitable roof,<lb/> and, in the evening, came to <placeName
                        key="blade">Bladensburg</placeName>, where<lb/> I had the company of a young

                    believe there is any thing meri-<lb/> torious in thus exposing his life and

                    the causes of the quarrel which he has<lb/> espoused. How lamentable is it that
                    the noblest<lb/> faculties of man should be debased, and the funda-<lb/> mental

                <p>In travelling this day, I passed<lb/> by a company of black slaves, chained together,<lb/>
                    <pb n="191" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_191"/> with a white man of a savage countenance, holding<lb/> a large
                    pistol in his hand, driving them before him.<lb/> Behind was a cart, in which
                    were some Negro<lb/> children, who had been torn from their parents by<lb/> this
                    member of civilized and polished society, who<lb/> was now taking them down into
                    Georgia, there<lb/> to remain in abject slavery for life. In viewing<lb/> this
                    painful scene as it passed before me, it was<lb/> almost impossible to avoid
                    noticing how different<lb/> were the countenances on the infant company in<lb/>
                    the cart, compared with that of their unfeeling<lb/> conductor. On the former
                    were seen the smiles<lb/> of innocence, whilst on the latter sat brooding<lb/> a
                    mixture of cruelty and avarice, which no pen or<lb/> pencil can describe. </p>
                <p>In the afternoon I came to <placeName key="wash">Washington
                    city</placeName>;<lb/> and on the 9th I attended the meeting at <orgName
                        key="meetwdc">Wash-<lb/>ington</orgName>. After meeting I was kindly invited by<lb/>
                    <persName key="mpayn1">M. P.</persName> to her son-in-law's house, who is
                    Secretary<lb/> of State; but, having engaged to spend the after-<lb/>noon
                    elsewhere, I was obliged to decline the offer.<lb/> In the evening I had the
                    company of a native of Fal-<lb/>mouth; but, of late years, he has been employed
                    in<lb/> the national dock-yard at Washington city, as naval<lb/> architect. I
                    understood that he had, early in life,<lb/> been invited over to this country
                    Doctor<lb/> Franklin, as one skilled in ship-building. Having<lb/> had his
                    education in our society, it appeared in-<lb/>consistent that he should be
                    employed in con-<lb/>
                    <pb n="192" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_192"/>structing ships of war; but I found he had forfeited<lb/> his
                    membership. However, I am mistaken, if the<lb/> building of ships of war is not
                    a burden greater<lb/> than he will be able long to bear. A friend of<lb/> the
                    name of J. A. supped with us this evening.<lb/> He was from Providence in Rhode
                    Island, and<lb/> gave us an interesting narrative of a journey he<lb/> took
                    through the wilderness parts of this continent,<lb/> to New Orleans in
                    Louisiana. A considerable<lb/> part of the way he went by water in canoes,
                    hav-<lb/> ing Indian conductors, and passed through many<lb/> Indian
                    settlements, by the chiefs of which he<lb/> was, in general, kindly and
                    hospitably entertained.<lb/> At one Indian village in particular, the
                    chief,<lb/> calling together the inhabitants to a place where<lb/> they held
                    their public meetings, and placing<lb/> Jonathan by his side, made a long
                    harangue. The<lb/> substance of it was, his approbation of the prin-<lb/>ciples
                    and practices of friends, concerning which<lb/> he had obtained information at
                    some former pe-<lb/>riod, and which he then endeavoured to explain<lb/> to the
                    Indians about him. Amongst other things<lb/> he remarked, it was a self-evident
                    truth, that the<lb/> Power which gave life and breath to man, alone<lb/> had the
                    right to take it. At another settlement<lb/> of Indians, he was agreeably
                    surprised to find<lb/> what great progress was made in agriculture and<lb/>
                    manufactures. He was told, that in this district<lb/> there were 200 looms
                    employed by Indians; and<lb/> at the table of the chief at which he was enter-<lb/>
                    <pb n="193" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_193"/>tained, there was every kind of vegetables and<lb/> fruit common in
                    the cities of America; such<lb/> as pease, beans, cabbages, asparagus,
                    melons,<lb/> peaches, &amp;c. At dinner, amongst other things, a<lb/> quarter of
                    roasted lamb was served up; a thing<lb/> hardly to have been expected at an
                    Indian table. </p>

                <p>This morning I visited S. B.<lb/> at his office in the Treasury, of which he is
                    the<lb/> head clerk. From the Treasury I was kindly<lb/> conducted by J. P. to
                    his mother's, who was<lb/> then resident with her son-in-law, <persName
                        key="jmadi1">J. M.</persName> the pre-<lb/> sent Secretary of State to the
                    United States. I<lb/> spent a little time pleasantly with the Secretary,<lb/>
                    who was confined to his house, by a hurt he had<lb/> received upon his knee; and
                    although pretty much<lb/> a stranger in the family, I received a kind
                    invita-<lb/> tion to call at his house, whenever business might<lb/> lead me to
                    Washington city. </p>
                <p>As I had never seen <persName key="tjeff2">Thomas Jefferson</persName>, the<lb/>
                    President of the United States, this hospitable<lb/> family offered to introduce
                    me to him, and the<lb/> Secretary's brother-in-law accompanied me to the<lb/>
                    President's house, where I was received by him<lb/> with a shake by the hand, as
                    though we had been<lb/> old acquaintance; and immediately he entered into<lb/>
                    conversation with as much freedom as if we had<lb/> been long known to each
                    other. After sitting a<lb/>
                    <pb n="194" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_194"/> short time in this friendly way, I informed him,<lb/> that as my
                    object in calling upon him, deserved<lb/> scarcely a better name than curiosity,
                    I should be<lb/> very sorry to detain him; especially as his time<lb/> must be
                    fully occupied with the important con-<lb/> cerns of <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName>; Congress being then sitting.<lb/> After this, rising
                    from my chair, he came forward,<lb/> and again taking me by the hand, bade me
                    farewell.<lb/> From his disregard to all useless forms and cere-<lb/> monies,
                    not excepting these of religion, his ene-<lb/> mies accuse him of being
                    deficient both in religion<lb/> and politeness. But there are men, that
                    have<lb/> seen a great deal of the world, who believe, on<lb/> good grounds,
                    that where true religion and true<lb/> politeness most abound, there we see
                    least of<lb/> forms and ceremonies, and that true religion and<lb/> true
                    politeness generally go hand in hand. </p>
                <p>Having received an invitation from one of the<lb/> Members of Congress, to attend
                    their sitting, I<lb/> this day went to the Capitol and heard their de-<lb/>
                    bates. I also visited the Hall where the Senate<lb/> was sitting; but as there
                    was nothing very interest-<lb/>ing before them, I had not an opportunity of<lb/>
                    hearing their principal orators. </p>
                <p>After visiting the Senate and House of Repre-<lb/>sentatives, I spent a short
                    time in the Supreme<lb/> Federal Court; where the <persName key="jmars2">Chief
                        Justice</persName> was then<lb/> sitting. Although a great part of the

                    <pb n="195" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_195"/> already finished, in a convenient, and indeed, in a<lb/> superb
                    style, yet a great deal remains to be done<lb/> before the whole will be

                    his wife, from their<lb/> own habitation, where I lodged last night. E. W.<lb/>
                    gave me an affecting account of a black slave,<lb/> residing near his house, who
                    is a pattern of inte-<lb/> grity and industry. Such is the confidence re-<lb/>
                    posed in him by his master, that for many years<lb/> past it has been his
                    practice to send this slave to<lb/> Baltimore, with his waggon laden with
                    various<lb/> kinds of produce, the sale of which he intrusts to<lb/> this black
                    man; also the care of receiving and<lb/> bringing home the money; by which means
                    it fre-<lb/> quently happens that large sums of money pass<lb/> through his
                    hands. This service he has performed<lb/> so much to the satisfaction of his
                    master, that he<lb/> scarcely ever ventures to employ any other person<lb/> for
                    these purposes. </p>
                <p>This faithful slave has a wife and a large family<lb/> of children, who reside in
                    a hut close by his mas-<lb/>ter's house. He is allowed a small portion of
                    time<lb/> weekly to do something for himself and family;<lb/> and being
                    frequently employed by the neighbours<lb/> to do little errands for them in
                    Baltimore, he has,<lb/>
                    <pb n="196" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_196"/> during many years of care, and frequently by hard<lb/> labour when
                    others were at rest, scraped together<lb/> about 200l. He lately made an offer
                    of all this<lb/> to his master for the freedom of his family; but<lb/> the
                    master absolutely refused to give him his liberty<lb/> on any condition,
                    alleging that he could not meet<lb/> not meet with another in whom he could so
                    confide. </p>
                <p>The poor man had greatly flattered himself with<lb/> hopes, that considering his
                    time of life, being now<lb/> about 50 years old, a much smaller sum would
                    have<lb/> procured his liberty; and it would indeed have pur-<lb/> chased that
                    of almost any other slave in the neigh-<lb/> bourhood. On finding his master
                    inexorable, his<lb/> disappointment and distress were extreme, and, in<lb/> the
                    anguish of his heart, he determined to leave<lb/> his wife and children, and
                    take the first opportu-<lb/> nity of quitting the country for ever. However<lb/>
                    he concluded first to call on E. W. who had<lb/> always been his friend and
                    adviser, to inform him<lb/> of his resolution. E. W. sympathized with him<lb/>
                    in his affliction, but did not let that suffice; for he<lb/> went immediately to
                    the master, and used every<lb/> endeavour to prevail upon him to accept the<lb/>
                    money offered, and, to grant the man and his<lb/> family their freedom. In order
                    to induce the mas-<lb/> ter's compliance, E. W. represented to him the<lb/>
                    exceedingly ungenerous return he was making to<lb/> the poor man for his
                    fidelity and industry; as the<lb/> only plea urged by this unfeeling master, for his<lb/>
                    <pb n="197" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_197"/> cruel conduct, was the uprightness and integrity<lb/> of the
                    Slave!! But, alas! avarice is deaf to all<lb/> arguments except those of
                    self-interest; it was<lb/> therefore in vain that E. W. thus pleaded the<lb/>
                    cause of suffering virtue; for the hardened task-<lb/> master was inexorable to
                    all his reasonings; and<lb/> the poor black man and his family remain in
                    bon-<lb/> dage, living witnesses to what a pitch of obduracy,<lb/> avarice and
                    self-interest can harden the heart of<lb/> man. As nothing that E. W. could say
                    had any<lb/> effect upon the master, he thought it his duty to<lb/> endeavour to
                    reconcile the poor slave to a hard<lb/> lot, and to persuade him not to leave
                    his wife and<lb/> family, as it appeared his full determination to<lb/> have
                    done. In this he was more successful; for<lb/> the poor man concluded to remain
                    with them, and<lb/> endeavour to bear his burden with patience. </p>

                    conjointly with many others. I took a walk<lb/> with him to view the work as it

                <p>This day I dined with G. M.<lb/> an ancient friend, who held the office of

                <p>I visited <persName key="gpopp1">G. P.</persName> one of the<lb/> friends lately
                    come from Amsterdam to settle in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>. They had opened a shop here
                    which<lb/> they had furnished with the manufactures of<lb/> France and Germany;
                    and for the short time they<lb/> had been in business, had met with good

                <p>I attended <orgName key="meetbalt">Baltimore forenoon<lb/> meeting</orgName>, and
                    in the afternoon attended by J. T.<lb/> and G. M. left that city. In the evening
                    we came<lb/> to <persName key="hjudg1">H. J.</persName>'s, a minister who is
                    well respected in this<lb/> neighbourhood. His house and plantation lie
                    near<lb/> the <geogName key="gunpo">Gunpowder Falls</geogName>, and not far from
                    the meet-<lb/> ing which bears that name. I was told of a re-<lb/> markable
                    preservation which the friends of this<lb/> meeting experienced during the
                    revolutionary war<lb/> in America. As our society generally had shewn<lb/> an
                    attachment to the government of England, at<lb/> the breaking out of the
                    revolution, and had, as a<lb/> body, adhered to their peaceable principle in
                    re-<lb/> fusing to take and active part in the struggle, there<lb/> were many
                    amongst the most violent of the revolt-<lb/> ing colonists, who were greatly
                    exasperated against<lb/> friends. However a few individuals in the society,<lb/>
                    were not so careful as in common prudence they<lb/>
                    <pb n="200" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_200"/> ought to have been; and several of them were<lb/> accordingly
                    tried, convicted, and executed, as<lb/> traitors to their country. The conduct
                    of these<lb/> of imprudent individuals, increased the disgust of<lb/> those
                    violent partizans, and it sometimes happened<lb/> that innocent friends were
                    dragged from their<lb/> meeting-houses to prison. At that period, a part<lb/> of
                    the American army lay near the Gunpowder<lb/> Falls meeting-house, which,
                    however, did not pre-<lb/>vent friends from holding their meetings for
                    wor-<lb/>ship. Amongst the troops of which this part of<lb/> the army was
                    composed, there was a Colonel of a<lb/> regiment of dragoons, whose resentment
                    against<lb/> friends was raised to such a pitch of malice, that<lb/> one day,
                    when traversing the country, he came to<lb/> the most extraordinary and cruel
                    resolution of<lb/> putting to the sword, the friends who were then<lb/>
                    collected at their place of worship; considering<lb/> them as no better than a
                    company of traitors.<lb/> Drawing up his men near the spot, he ordered<lb/> them
                    to halt, in order to make arrangements for<lb/> the execution of his dreadful
                    purpose. At this<lb/> moment an awful silent pause took place, in<lb/> which he
                    felt his mind so powerfully smitten<lb/> with conviction that he not only drew
                    off his<lb/> men, but conceived very favourable sentiments of<lb/> the society;
                    and continuing to yield to his convic-<lb/>tions, he afterwards joined in
                    communion with<lb/> friends, and continued faithful to the principle of<lb/>
                    truth as professed by them.</p>

                <p>This morning we passed by<lb/>
                    <placeName key="notth">Nottingham</placeName> meeting house, in the
                    neighbourhood<lb/> of which <persName key="jchur1">John Churchman</persName>
                    formerly resided.<lb/> About noon we came to S. C.'s to dinner, where<lb/> we
                    had the company of <persName key="mstro1">Mary Stroud</persName>, one of
                    the<lb/> fifteen children of <persName key="jgilp1">Joseph Gilpin</persName>,
                    mentioned by<lb/> by <persName key="tchal1">Thomas Chalkly</persName> in his
                    Journal, page 313, Edit.<lb/> 1766. This friend was in very low
                    circumstances<lb/> at the time <persName key="tchal1">Chalkly</persName> first
                    visited him, and<lb/> his habitation was a cave by the side of a moun-<lb/>
                    tain; although many of his descendants, at this<lb/> time, are people in
                    opulence in America. The<lb/> cave is now in the possession of one of them,
                    at<lb/> whose house I was once hospitably entertained,<lb/> and who considers it
                    as reflecting honour upon the<lb/> family, rather than as being any
                    disparagement to<lb/> it. <persName key="mstro1">Mary Stroud</persName>,
                    although about 100 years old,<lb/> still retained her faculties in an
                    extraordinary<lb/> manner, and her observations were often shrewd<lb/> and

                <p>I attended the <orgName key="meetwestq">quarterly meet-<lb/>ing at London
                        Grove</orgName>, the closing sitting of which,<lb/> was one of the largest I

                    <persName key="rmott1">R. M.</persName> two valuable American ministers,
                    were<lb/> here; the latter of whom appeared in an extraor-<lb/> dinary manner,
                    and being a young man of an<lb/> amiable disposition, and pleasing delivery, he
                    will,<lb/> I trust, continue a useful ornament in the church.<lb/> Yet how
                    frequently do we see the fairest hopes<lb/>
                    <pb n="202" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_202"/> and prospects troubled; sometimes by the unwise<lb/> attentions
                    and adulations of the admiring crowd.<lb/> It is greatly to be lamented, that
                    even those who<lb/> in an especial manner are placed as guardians and<lb/>
                    overseers of the shepherds, are not altogether clear<lb/> of fanning that little
                    spark of vanity, which the<lb/> grand enemy contrives, in one form or other,
                    to<lb/> light in almost every human breast. </p>
                <p>On coming out of the house after the breaking<lb/> up of these meeting, I was
                    surprised at the great<lb/> number of horses and carriages standing on the<lb/>
                    ground before the meeting-house. The space<lb/> they occupied consisted of
                    several acres; and, from<lb/> the best judgment I was able to form, there
                    were<lb/> nearly 200 carriages of different descriptions,<lb/> mostly on
                    springs, and more than double that<lb/> number of horses, exclusive of those
                    used in the<lb/> carriages. The trifling expense at which horses<lb/> and
                    carriages are kept in the <emph rend="italic">country parts</emph> of Ame-<lb/>
                    rica, enables even those in slender circumstances<lb/> to keep them, which
                    certainly is a great privilege<lb/> in warm climates. After this meeting I took
                    my<lb/> leave of several of my friends, never expecting to<lb/> see them again
                    on this side of the grave. </p>
                <p>I spent part of this afternoon with J. P. an agree-<lb/> able friend, who had
                    devoted some years to the in-<lb/> struction of the Indians in letters and
                    agriculture,<lb/> &amp;c. and had been long amongst them in their settle-<lb/>
                    <pb n="203" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_203"/>ments. He related a variety of little anecdotes<lb/> concerning
                    these untutored sons of the forest, cha-<lb/> racteristic of their habits and
                    manners, from which<lb/> it seemed, that the restraints and confinement of<lb/>
                    mechanics and labourers in civilized life, are con-<lb/> sidered by them as the
                    greatest of human miseries;<lb/> and that one nation should even wish to
                    spread<lb/> their manufactures amongst other nations, and thus<lb/> become
                    labourers to those for whom they have no<lb/> knowledge or regard, was, in their
                    eyes, the height<lb/> of human folly. </p>
                <p>As the plan in which J. P. was engaged did<lb/> not profess to interfere with the
                    religious concerns<lb/> of the Indians, they were not often a subject of<lb/>
                    conversation with; yet the Indians would some-<lb/> times observe, that they
                    should have no objec-<lb/> tion to attending Friends' meetings, if it were
                    not<lb/> too long to sit doing nothing, without the privilege<lb/> of a pipe.
                    Instances, however, have occurred,<lb/> amongst such untutored individuals,
                    wherein they<lb/> have evinced conviction that the Great Spirit may<lb/> be
                    known and worshipped in silence. </p>
                <p>On my arrival at S. P.'s, I found his wife in a<lb/> poor stage of health; and
                    although considerably<lb/> reduced by sickness, yet her natural lively and<lb/>
                    cheerful disposition seemed to rise superior to her<lb/> bodily affliction. She
                    made respectful mention of<lb/> number of European friends, who had visited<lb/>
                    her habitation; particularly M.R. and J.W.;<lb/>
                    <pb n="204" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_204"/> the manners of the latter, and her dialect, in broad<lb/> Irish,
                    had entertained her very much.</p>
                <p>While in this family, I could not avoid noticing<lb/> the innocence and
                    simplicity of a little Negro<lb/> boy, named <persName key="sado"
                        >Sado</persName>; and on my making some in-<lb/>quiry, <persName
                        key="mpain1">Martha Painter</persName> gave an account to the<lb/> following
                    effect:--Importing Negro slaves from<lb/> the coast of Africa, is contrary to
                    the laws of the<lb/> United States, notwithstanding some of the<lb/> Southern
                    States allow the keeping of slaves, and<lb/> it sometimes happens that an
                    American ship is<lb/> detected transgressing the law, in which case both<lb/>
                    ship and cargo are confiscated. Not long since,<lb/> two American ships with
                    cargoes of slaves were<lb/> seized by a frigate belonging to the United
                    States,<lb/> and brought to the Port of Philadelphia, where<lb/> they were both
                    condemned; but the poor black<lb/> people on board were put under the care of
                    the<lb/> Society instituted for the Abolition of the Slave<lb/> Trade, and were
                    all provided with places as ser-<lb/> vants or apprentices. Amongst the latter
                    was<lb/> little <persName key="sado">Sado</persName>, who was put out to S. P.
                    Although<lb/> he was treated with the greatest tenderness, yet he<lb/> was often
                    seen weeping at the recollection of his<lb/> near connexions. He said, that
                    himself and sister<lb/> were on a visit to a relation's, and that, after
                    the<lb/> family had retired to rest, they were suddenly<lb/> alarmed, in the
                    dead of the night, by a company<lb/> of Man-stealers breaking into their habitation.<lb/>
                    <pb n="205" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_205"/> They were all carried off towards the sea, where<lb/> they arrived
                    at the end of three days, and were<lb/> confined until the vessel sailed.
                        <persName key="sado">Sado</persName>'s sister was<lb/> placed in a situation
                    near S. P.'s, which afforded<lb/> them frequent opportunities of seeing each
                    other.<lb/> Not long after this Negro boy had been brought<lb/> into S. P.'s
                    family, he was taken ill of a bad fever;<lb/> and, for a time, there appeared
                    but little hopes of<lb/> his recovery, although the best medical help was<lb/>
                    obtained, and every kindness and attention was<lb/> shewn to him. While he laid
                    in this state, M. P.<lb/> inquired of him, if there was any thing he wished<lb/>
                    to have, or if there was any thing she could do<lb/> for him; as they desired to
                    do every thing in their<lb/> power to relieve him. In reply, he expressed
                    his<lb/> thankfulness for their good intentions, but said,<lb/>
                    <said who="sado">There was nothing they could do that would<lb/> cure him; yet
                        if he was at home with his mother,<lb/> she would soon make him well;</said>
                    adding that <said who="sado">there<lb/> was a plant grew in his country, the
                        leaves of<lb/> which she gathered, and poured hot water upon<lb/> them,
                        covered his body all over with them, and it<lb/> always soon made him
                        well.</said>
                    <persName key="mpain1">Martha</persName> desired him<lb/> to prescribe the
                    plant, and they would endeavour to<lb/> procure it. He replied, <said who="sado"
                        >It was not to be had in<lb/> this country, for he had often looked for it
                        in<lb/> vain.</said>
                </p>
                <p>There being now scarcely any prospect of his<lb/> recovery, his mistress was
                    desirous of administer-<lb/>
                    <pb n="206" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_206"/>ing some religious consolation, and observed to<lb/> him, as he had
                    always been a very good boy, she<lb/> had no doubt that if he died at this time,
                    his<lb/> spirit would be admitted into a place of everlast-<lb/> ing rest and
                    peace. On hearing this, he quickly<lb/> replied, <said who="sado">I know; that
                        if I die I shall be happy;<lb/> for as soon as my body is dead, my spirit
                        will fly<lb/> away to my father and mother, and sisters and<lb/> brothers,
                        in Africa.</said> The boy recovered. His<lb/> good conduct had gained him
                    the favour and re-<lb/> spect of the whole family, and I have no doubt<lb/> that
                    the care bestowed upon his education, will,<lb/> in due time, afford him a
                    brighter prospect of a<lb/> future state, than that of returning to Africa. </p>
                <p>I have sometimes turned my attention to the<lb/> orderly conduct, and pleasing
                    dispositions of some<lb/> of these Black children, whom I have seen in<lb/>
                    friends families. On considering that they have<lb/> been violently torn from
                    their near relatives and<lb/> friends, and exposed to all the horrors and
                    sick-<lb/> ness of transportation in a slave ship; I have<lb/> compared them
                    with the kidnappers, and with the<lb/> owners, captains, and crews of slave
                    ships, who<lb/> assume the name of Christians, and, with the<lb/> greatest
                    self-complacency, make pretensions to<lb/> being governed by the precepts and
                    example of<lb/> Christ; whilst they give the appellation of Hea-<lb/> thens and
                    Infidels to these poor unoffending Negro<lb/> children, as a cover to their
                    cruelty. In such a<lb/>
                    <pb n="207" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_207"/> contemplation and comparison, the mind is over-<lb/> whelmed with
                    sorrow, at the idea of the atrocity<lb/> and darkness in which human nature may
                    be in-<lb/> volved, by the unbounded thirst of gold. </p>

                <p>I left S. P.'s hospitable roof<lb/> accompanied by his brother-in-law J. T.
                    The<lb/> ground I travelled over this day was the scene of<lb/> much bloodshed
                    during the revolutionary war; it<lb/> being that part of the country where the
                    bat-<lb/> tle of Brandywine was fought. My companion<lb/> was present at the
                    time, with several other<lb/> friends, who were led forth by the dictates of
                    hu-<lb/> manity, in order to lend some assistance to the<lb/> poor wounded and
                    dying soldiers, that lay scat-<lb/> tered over the fields, through an extent of
                    several<lb/> miles. On this occasion friends meeting-house of<lb/> Birmingham
                    was converted into an hospital, in<lb/> which many of the poor mangled creatures
                    breathed<lb/> their last, and where many more suffered the am-<lb/> putation of
                    their limbs, with many other pain-<lb/> ful operations concomitant with the
                    carnage of<lb/> war. Amongst those who ended their earthly<lb/> course in this
                    meeting-house, were several officers,<lb/> who were buried in friends burying
                    ground. One<lb/> of them, a near connexion of the Duke of North-<lb/> umberland,
                    was a young man of the name of<lb/> Percy, whose amiable and exemplary
                    conduct<lb/> under his severe sufferings, had procured him the<lb/>
                    <pb n="208" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_208"/> particular regard and esteem of the friends about<lb/> him. The
                    shocking situation of some they found<lb/> in the fields, would not bear
                    description; in others<lb/> who lay lifeless on the ground, it was some
                    time<lb/> before any wound could be discovered, a single<lb/> bullet having
                    passed through some vital part;<lb/> others had the fleshy part of a leg or a
                    thigh torn<lb/> to pieces by larger balls, and had sunk under the<lb/> loss of
                    blood. </p>
                <p>These scenes of horror were followed by others,<lb/> if possible, still more
                    revolting to human nature.<lb/> Those who have travelled much in America
                    must<lb/> have observed the deep channels that are in many<lb/> places worn in
                    the declivities of their fields, owing<lb/> to the great depth of soil and the
                    heavy showers<lb/> to which they are subject in that country. It so<lb/>
                    happened that the dead bodies of many of those who<lb/> were slain in this
                    battle, were interred in these chan-<lb/> nels, and remained so for some time
                    undisturbed;<lb/> but, afterwards, some heavy rains falling, the earth<lb/> was
                    washed away, and many of the dead bodies<lb/> were again exposed to view in a
                    putrid state. </p>
                <p>After spending an hour or two at <placeName key="wches">West
                    Chester</placeName><lb/> we came to S. J.'s, where we dined and spent the<lb/>
                    rest of the day. At this friends house, <persName key="lagn1">General<lb/>
                        L'Agneau</persName> made his head-quarters for some time<lb/> before the
                    battle of Germantown, where he lost<lb/> his life. That part of the English army
                    under his<lb/>
                    <pb n="209" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_209"/> command was encamped in S. J.'s fields and<lb/> orchard, round
                    about the house. </p>

                <p>This morning I came to J. K.'s<lb/> habitation and spent a few hours with him in
                    con-<lb/> versation respecting my friends in England, he<lb/> having lately

                <p>I slept last night at W. T.'s,<lb/> and this day went over J. T.'s estate, where
                    I vi-<lb/> sited the old family mansion, which was erected<lb/> on the first
                    settlement of this country. In many<lb/> parts of America, and particularly in
                    this neigh-<lb/> bourhood, it is the practice of many farmers to<lb/> reserve
                    about 15 or 20 acres of land for hay,<lb/> which they continue to mow from one
                    generation<lb/> to another, many of them laying on but little or<lb/> no manure;
                    but taking the advantage of situation,<lb/> where the land may easily be
                    irrigated or over<lb/> spread with water from time to time. By this<lb/> means
                    they obtain heavy crops of grass without<lb/> the aid of manure, and thus supply
                    themselves<lb/> with winter fodder at an easy expense. On in-<lb/> quiry of W.
                    T. and P. P. two very respectable<lb/> farmers and land-owners, they informed me
                    that,<lb/> upon an average, they got about 2 1/2 tons per acre<lb/> each year,
                    upon this plan. The land usually<lb/> chosen for this purpose is not a dead flat
                    or<lb/> marshy land, but commonly the two sides of a<lb/>
                    <pb n="210" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_210"/> narrow valley of easy ascent on each hand, having<lb/> a small
                    stream running through the bottom. When<lb/> the land is to be watered, the
                    stream at the upper<lb/> end of the valley is diverted from its natural
                    bed,<lb/> and is conducted in narrow channels along each<lb/> side of the valley
                    on as high ground as the head<lb/> of the stream will admit; and, by placing
                    obstruc-<lb/> tions to the current of the streams, in different<lb/> parts of
                    the artificial channels, the water continues<lb/> to trickle down the sides of
                    the valley, so as plen-<lb/> tifully and regularly to water the roots of
                    the<lb/> grass, but not in such quantities as to cover the<lb/> herbage. </p>
                <p>In the course of the day we paid A. S. a visit,<lb/> and in that evening came to
                    A. H.'s, another<lb/> brother-in-law to J. T. Here I met with one of<lb/> the
                    oldest copies of the English Bible I had ever<lb/> seen; it was translated by
                    Coverley, at a period<lb/> when the sacred volume was not divided into
                    chap-<lb/> ters and verses, and both the language and the<lb/> type bore evident
                    marks of great antiquity. The<lb/> word shoes I noticed was always spelled
                    shoon,<lb/> and righteousness was always spelled rightwiseness,<lb/> and in many
                    other respects the language was so<lb/> very different from what it is at this
                    day, as scarcely,<lb/> in many places, to be like the same tongue. </p>
                <p>During part of the revolutionary contest, this<lb/> friend's house was the
                    head-quarters of General<lb/> Stirling, and, sometimes, consultations were held<lb/>
                    <pb n="211" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_211"/> here by the American General Officers, at which<lb/>
                    <persName key="gwash1">General Washington</persName> attended. While the
                    armies<lb/> lay in this neighbourhood, the farmers suffered<lb/> severely in
                    their property; one instance of which<lb/> this friend mentioned to me, as
                    descriptive of the<lb/> situation of things amongst them;--A near neigh-<lb/>
                    bour, who had a considerable stock of cheese on<lb/> hand, which it was found
                    needfull to hide to pre-<lb/> vent being plundered of it, was in hopes an
                    op-<lb/> portunity might occur when it might be sold at a<lb/> fair price, and
                    to a regular customer; but it so<lb/> happened, that some officers who were
                    encamped<lb/> in the vicinity, had got some information respecting<lb/> this
                    stock of cheese. One of them sent a servant<lb/> to the mistress of the house,
                    who stated, that his<lb/> master was extremely anxious to taste one of her<lb/>
                    cheeses, having been told that she made a better<lb/> article than any of her
                    neighbours, and that not<lb/> having tasted any of a long time that was fit
                    to<lb/> eat, he would freely give her a guinea for a small<lb/> one. However the
                    servant was not able to ascer-<lb/> tain the fact, and of course returned
                    without<lb/> accomplishing his errand. Upon this the officer<lb/> went himself
                    to the house, and, after a deal of<lb/> persuasion, prevailed upon the mistress
                    to furnish<lb/> him with two or three, for which he very freely<lb/> gave her a
                    guinea each. </p>
                <p>He had watched the mistress so closely, that he<lb/> discovered where the stock
                    of cheese was laid up,<lb/>
                    <pb n="212" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_212"/> without appearing to have observed whence she<lb/> brought the
                    cheeses for him. After many expres-<lb/> sions of thankfulness, that be had been
                    supplied<lb/> with such an excellent article, he returned to the<lb/> camp; but
                    the result was, that, next day, a party of<lb/> armed soldiers came to the
                    house, and, after forci-<lb/>bly taking the money which the officer had paid
                    the<lb/> day before, they went to the room where the<lb/> cheese was kept, and
                    carried the whole out, with-<lb/> out paying any thing for it. Such is the
                    morality<lb/> of war!</p>

                <p>We rode to W. J.'s house,<lb/> at <placeName key="wgrove">West Grove</placeName>,
                    to breakfast; and after attending<lb/> their meeting, spent the afternoon at his
                    house, in<lb/> pleasant conversation with himself and his wife,<lb/> who is an
                    agreeable cheerful woman. W. J. gave<lb/> me a little history of the emigration
                    of his family<lb/> into this country, from Ireland:--Being in very<lb/> low
                    circumstances, they were glad to put up with<lb/> what way then considered the
                    worst lot of land in<lb/> that part; and on their first coming here they
                    were<lb/> visited by a friend who was already settled, and<lb/> had got his
                    house built, and his land in a state of<lb/> cultivation. This friend being
                    touched with com-<lb/>passion, went home and told his own family how<lb/> deeply
                    he felt for the poor Irish family, who, he<lb/> feared would never be able to
                    get bread to sup-<lb/>port themselves, the land was so very indifferent;<lb/>
                    and taking out a bushel of malt, sent it to them to<lb/>
                    <pb n="213" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_213"/> make a little beer to support their spirits under<lb/> their
                    discouraging prospect. Such is the altera-<lb/>tion that has taken place, that,
                    at this time, the land<lb/> which was then thought insufficient for the
                    support<lb/> of one family is now divided into several planta-<lb/>tions or
                    farms, each of which is considered as<lb/> amply sufficient for the support of a
                    family in<lb/> ease and even in affluence. One of these plan-<lb/>tations is
                    that now belonging to W. J. and on<lb/> which he resides. </p>
                <p>This night I lodged at P. P.'s. Here also I<lb/> met with a smart little Negro
                    boy, who had been<lb/> stolen from his parents in Africa, and was placed<lb/> in
                    this family by the Abolition Society. He had<lb/> the character of being a boy
                    of a bright capacity;<lb/> and although not very communicative to his<lb/>
                    master and mistress, he was open and free with<lb/> the children of the family,
                    and would often, by<lb/> the fireside in the winter evenings, recite to
                    them<lb/> the mournful story of his being made captive; with<lb/> many shocking
                    circumstances that attended his<lb/> transportation in the slave ship; from
                    which he<lb/> was liberated by an American ship of war. </p>
                <p>After breakfast I set out for <placeName key="merio">Merion</placeName>, in
                    com-<lb/> pany with I. J. and in my way passed by the front<lb/> of Westown
                    school. By his school is managed upon<lb/> a plan somewhat similar to that at
                    Ackworth, but<lb/> with this difference, that the children of friends in<lb/>
                    <pb n="214" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_214"/> affluent circumstances are not excluded. The<lb/> number of
                    scholars in the house is generally<lb/> about 200, including boys and girls. </p>
                <p>In the evening I came to <placeName key="merio">Merion</placeName> where I
                    found<lb/> letters from my family and friends, as late as the<lb/> 27th of

                <p>Being the first of the week I<lb/> attended meeting in the forenoon, and spent
                    the<lb/> evening at H. B.'s, where I had the company of<lb/> his father and
                    mother, and R. J.; the latter being<lb/> far advanced in years, of an active
                    lively disposi-<lb/> tion and having a retentive memory, would fre-<lb/> quently
                    favour me with little anecdotes of the first<lb/> settlers in the neighbourhood,
                    which he had re-<lb/> ceived from the parties themselves, in the early<lb/> part
                    of his life. Amongst the rest he related a<lb/> little story which he had heard
                    from an ancient<lb/> friend at whose house he had lodged, of the name<lb/> of
                    Rebecca Wood. When a little girl she used<lb/> sometimes walk from Derby, where
                    she resided,<lb/> to Haverford meeting, the distance of a few miles.<lb/> One
                    day she was walking along she was over-<lb/> taken by a friend on horseback, who
                    proved to be<lb/>
                    <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName>. On coming up with her he
                    in-<lb/> quired where she was going; and on her inform-<lb/> ing him, he, with
                    his usual good nature, desired<lb/> her to get up behind him; and, bringing his horse<lb/>
                    <pb n="215" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_215"/> to a convenient place, she mounted, and so rode<lb/> away upon the
                    bare back. Being without shoes<lb/> or stockings, her bare legs and feet hung
                    dangling<lb/> by the side of the governor's horse. Although<lb/> William Penn
                    was at this time both governor<lb/> and proprietor, he did not think it beneath
                    him<lb/> thus to help along a poor bare footed girl on her<lb/> way to meeting,
                    and notwithstanding the maxims<lb/> and customs of the world, these little kind
                    offices<lb/> to those in low stations in life, were so far from<lb/> lowering
                    him in the estimation of those he was<lb/> appointed to govern, that there
                    perhaps never was<lb/> a governor, who stood higher in the opinion of<lb/> those
                    governed by him, than <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName> did. </p>
                <p>In repeating this anecdote, the old friend ge-<lb/> nerally concluded her story
                    with the observation,<lb/> that, <q>there were no such governors now-a-days.</q>

                <p>I had the company of O. and<lb/> J. J. the latter of whom related to me a
                    tran-<lb/> saction of his, when but about 14 years of age,<lb/> which manifested
                    a considerable degree of firm-<lb/> ness in one so young. At the time of the
                    revolu-<lb/> tion, a neighbour was condemned to death tor his<lb/> attachment to
                    the English government. Under<lb/> these melancholy circumstances, the near
                    connex-<lb/> ions of the sufferer, were anxious that the body of<lb/> their
                    unhappy relative, should be decently interred<lb/> in the family burying ground
                    at Merion; but con-<lb/>
                    <pb n="216" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_216"/>sidering to what pitch of indignation the minds<lb/> of the people
                    were raised against him, it appeared<lb/> to be a very hazardous task to take
                    the body from the<lb/> place of execution, surrounded by the great crowd<lb/> of
                    spectators who were there assembled, to be<lb/> witnesses of the last struggles
                    of their devoted<lb/> countryman. However, J. J. although but a boy,<lb/>
                    undertook the task, and proceeding through the<lb/> multitude, without any
                    attendant, went up to the<lb/> executioner, and demanding the body, brought
                    it<lb/> off in a hearse, himself being the driver; and con-<lb/> ducted it
                    safely to the relatives of the deceased.<lb/> His youth and the singularity of

                    the spring. The chirping of these<lb/> lizards in the spring, and of the

                    <pb n="217" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_217"/> at the distance of more than a mile. Although<lb/> these sounds

                <p>In the forenoon I attended<lb/>
                    <orgName key="meetmer">Merion meeting</orgName>, and spent the afternoon at R.

                        <persName key="ppemb1">Phineas Pemberton</persName> and his wife,<lb/> first
                    became acquainted with each other; and they<lb/> being the first of that family
                    who came to America,<lb/> the story was interesting:--<persName key="ppemb1"
                        >Phineas</persName>, when a boy,<lb/> was an apprentice to a grocer in
                    Manchester, and<lb/> I believe the house in which he lived is still stand-<lb/>
                    ing, as J. P. one of his descendants, on his late visit<lb/> to England, had the
                    curiosity to take a look at it,<lb/> when in that neighbourhood. It happened, on
                    a<lb/> market-day, that whilst Phineas was serving the<lb/> customers, there
                    came in a country friend and his<lb/> daughter, of the name of Harrison, to
                    purchase<lb/> groceries for the family; and as they waited to be<lb/> served,
                    the daughter, who was but a little girl,<lb/> employed herself in eating
                    cherries out of a small<lb/> basket she had brought with her. As soon as<lb/>
                    Phineas was at liberty, he furnished the friend and<lb/> his daughter with the
                    groceries they wanted; and<lb/> the little girl having some of her cherries
                    to<lb/> spare, gave them to Phineas. Pleased with her<lb/> generosity, he
                    insisted upon her taking a paper of<lb/>
                    <pb n="218" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_218"/> raisins in return. From this trifling circumstance,<lb/> an
                    attachment originated which ended but with<lb/> their lives. They were united in
                    marriage when<lb/> of a suitable age; soon after which they emigrated<lb/> to
                    America, and afterwards became the heads of<lb/> one of the most respectable
                    families in Philadel-<lb/> phia. The young woman's father also went over<lb/> to
                    America with them. </p>
                <p>In recurring to the little story of <persName key="ppemb1">Phineas Pem-<lb/>
                        berton,</persName> we have an example of the instability of<lb/> things in
                    this changing scene. It is but a very<lb/> few years past that several branches
                    of this family,<lb/> seemed to stand foremost in rank both in the so-<lb/>
                    ciety, and in the American world in general; and<lb/> there was every
                    probability that the name and<lb/> family might continue numerous and
                    respectable<lb/> for many generations. But, if I recollect right, at<lb/> the

                <p>I came to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, where<lb/> I supped

                    an ancient valuable friend, a native of Leicester.<lb/>
                    <pb n="219" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_219"/> He left England in early life, along with his pa-<lb/> rents, who,
                    having imbibed favourable sentiments<lb/> of America, had bidden a final
                    farewell to their<lb/> native land. In the recollection of this friend, I<lb/>
                    have often thought that the general tenor of his<lb/> life and conversation,
                    possessed as much of what<lb/> I should call sterling Christianity, as I have
                    ever<lb/> observed in any other man. In him were seen the<lb/> innocence and
                    simplicity of a child, although he<lb/> was a man of considerable literary
                    attainments and<lb/> reputation in the world. Through life he had<lb/> been an
                    active and able advocate of the enslaved<lb/> Africans; and, though not backward
                    in giving a<lb/> sentiment on the passing public transactions of the<lb/> day,
                    he was far from being a busy-body in matters<lb/> of this kind; and such was the
                    religious subjection<lb/> into which his mind was brought, that, in
                    lamenting<lb/> or approving the measures of those in authority,<lb/> it was done
                    with a meekness and calmness, which<lb/> evinced that he was biassed by no
                    narrow, party<lb/> spirit in the observations he made; but that they<lb/> were
                    the effusions of a heart <q>which felt and<lb/> cared for all.</q> Being an
                    industrious man, and suc-<lb/>cessful in business, he had the means, as well
                    as<lb/> the inclination, of serving his friends and strangers.<lb/> Frequent
                    opportunities of the latter offered in this<lb/> city, where emigrants from

                <p>I was accompanied by <persName key="jparr1">John<lb/> Parish</persName> to A
                    W.'s, at whose house we supped and<lb/> spent the evening. A. W. some years
                    since, ac-<lb/> companied <persName key="jparr1">J. P.</persName> on a religious
                    visit to friends at<lb/> Pyrmont, and was with him in that place when he<lb/>
                    departed this life, in the assurance of a happy<lb/> eternity. On A. W.'s
                    return, he had to pass<lb/> through a part of the country occupied by the<lb/>
                    allied army, then engaged in its operations against<lb/> France. He was seized
                    and taken before the<lb/> commanding officer, who took great offence at his<lb/>
                    plain language, and not taking off his hat; and,<lb/> after a good deal of
                    abusive language, struck him<lb/> to the ground. Afterwards, when A. W. had
                    time<lb/> given him to explain who and what he was, the<lb/> General appeared
                    extremely ashamed of his con-<lb/>duct, and extorted a promise from him, that
                    he<lb/> would not expose him on account of this cruel<lb/> and unworthy
                    behaviour towards a peaceable<lb/> stranger. For this reason, in repeating the
                    story,<lb/> he always avoided giving the name of the General. </p>
                <p>After passing the limits of the German lines,<lb/> he soon came within those of
                    the French army,<lb/> commanded by <persName key="more1">General
                        Moreau</persName>, and was taken<lb/> before him by some of the soldiers on
                    the out-<lb/>posts; but here he was treated with great kind-<lb/> ness, and a
                    passport was given him, which enabled<lb/> him to pursue his journey without
                    further molesta-<lb/>tion. About the time that I am writing, <persName

                    Emperor, A. W. has had an opportunity of ac-<lb/>knowledging, and of returning
                    his kindness. The<lb/>
                    <persName key="more1">General</persName> has taken up his residence about 20
                    miles<lb/> from Philadelphia, having his wife and family<lb/> with him. Several
                    friends paid a good deal of<lb/> attention to them, on a count of his humane
                    and<lb/> generous conduct. Thus this little act of genero-<lb/>sity to an
                    unprotected stranger, proved the cause of<lb/> many kind attentions to himself
                    and family, when<lb/> the scene was changed, and when he, from being a<lb/>
                    victorious General, commanding a powerful army,<lb/> was become an exile in a
                    foreign land. This little<lb/> history affords a useful lesson to men in power.

                    days ago the poor man came up from Dela-<lb/> ware State, and, at the
                    recommendation of his<lb/> brother, H. B. had taken him into his family for<lb/>
                    protection. At the same time he related to me<lb/> the following
                    narrative:--Some time since the<lb/>
                    <pb n="222" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_222"/> master of this black slave died, leaving behind him<lb/> a widow,
                    and one son, a profligate young man.<lb/> As the master lay on his death-bed, he
                    called<lb/> this faithful slave to him, and taking him by the<lb/> hand, told
                    him that he felt his end was fast ap-<lb/>proaching, and that his mistress would
                    have little<lb/> to depend upon for her support, except what she<lb/> might be
                    able to make of his labour; and there-<lb/>fore he begged that he would continue
                    to be faith-<lb/> ful to her, after the master should be laid in the<lb/> silent
                    grave. In a very short time the master<lb/> died, and the slave continued his
                    services to his<lb/> mistress, and much to her satisfaction; enabling<lb/> her,
                    for several years, to live comfortably, and also<lb/> to administer to the wants
                    of her profligate sun;<lb/> so that, under a grateful sense of his worth,
                    she<lb/> determined to make this black man free, and also<lb/> his family,
                    consisting of a wife and three children.<lb/> A writing was accordingly drawn
                    up, and duly<lb/> executed, whereby they were all liberated; and the<lb/>
                    happiness of this family, under these circumstances,<lb/> may be more easily
                    conceived than described. </p>
                <p>Their industry and sobriety, manifested whilst<lb/> in bondage, now had its full
                    effect; and all went<lb/> on happily and comfortably, until the profli-<lb/>
                    gate son, before mentioned, who had by idleness<lb/> and drunkenness reduced
                    himself to extreme ne-<lb/>cessity, conceived the cruel plan of
                    invalidating<lb/> the indenture with his another had executed, to<lb/>
                    <pb n="223" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_223"/> give this worthy Negro family their liberty; and<lb/> actually
                    sold the father, mother, and the three<lb/> children, to a company of Georgia
                    slave dealers,<lb/> who were then in the neighbourhood. They being<lb/>
                    conscious that the young man had no right thus<lb/> to sell the family, had
                    determined to take them<lb/> away in the dead of the night, to preclude the
                    pos-<lb/> sibility of applying to any magistrate for pro-<lb/> tection. However,
                    the Negro had got some<lb/> intimation of what was going forward, and, in<lb/>
                    consequence, kept loaded fire arms in his house,<lb/> being determined to shoot
                    any person who should<lb/> attempt to break into his habitation. These pre-<lb/>
                    cautions being known to the slave dealers, they,<lb/> for some time, did not
                    venture to molest him;<lb/> but he and his wife being soon wearied with
                    liv-<lb/>ing in this state of anxious suspense, consulted a<lb/> fellow Negro,
                    in whom they placed confidence, as<lb/> to their best method of proceeding; and
                    it was<lb/> concluded that the whole family should leave that<lb/> part of the
                    country, and settle in Pennsylvania, as<lb/> soon as possible; where they would
                    be out of the<lb/> reach of the slave dealers. </p>
                <p>No sooner was this determination come to, than<lb/> their perfidious friend, for
                    the sake of a trifling<lb/> reward, went to the Georgia slave traders, to
                    betray<lb/> the whole family into their hands; and, in the mid-<lb/> dle of the
                    night, they were seized, bound, and forci-<lb/>bly taken from their comfortable
                    habitation, in order<lb/> to be put on board a small sloop which lay in the<lb/>
                    <pb n="224" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_224"/> river, near at hand. On coming near the river, the<lb/> poor black
                    man, who had been placed on horse-<lb/>back, behind one of these Georgia men,
                    suddenly<lb/> broke loose, and leaping from the horse, plunged<lb/> headlong
                    into the river, which he quickly swam<lb/> across, and, getting into the woods,
                    escaped from<lb/> his inhuman pursuers. On this occasion, the agi-<lb/> tation
                    of the poor wife and children was beyond<lb/> expression; and to silence the
                    shrieks and cries of<lb/> this miserable family, these unprincipled men
                    beat<lb/> them unmercifully; and the last with the poor<lb/> Negro man saw of
                    this scene, as he fled into the<lb/> woods, was their beating his wife upon the
                    head,<lb/> in the most brutal manner. To a person who has<lb/> not been an
                    eye-witness to such scenes, it may ap-<lb/>pear incredible that transactions of
                    so attrocious<lb/> nature, could occur under a form of government<lb/> like that
                    of the United States; but the slavery of<lb/> the Negroes having long since been
                    introduced,<lb/> the evil consequences resulting from it have not<lb/> yet been
                    rooted out of the Southern States; where<lb/> a warm climate seems to have
                    enervated both the<lb/> bodies and the mind of the white inhabitants. It<lb/>
                    is, however, to the credit of the people of Pennsyl-<lb/>vania, and the States
                    to the eastward and north-<lb/>ward of them, that almost every thing in
                    their<lb/> power has been done, to induce their southern<lb/> neighbours to
                    relinquish the infamous, and de-<lb/>basing system of personal slavery; and
                    there can<lb/> be scarcely a doubt, if they persevere in their<lb/>
                    <pb n="225" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_225"/> honourable endeavours, that they will, in the end,<lb/> be crowned
                    with success. </p>
                <p>In conversation this evening with <persName key="sbrya1">Samuel
                    Bryant</persName>,<lb/> a son of the Judge of that name, he mentioned<lb/> that
                        <persName key="bfran1">Doctor Franklin</persName> was an intimate friend of
                    his<lb/> father and that in consequence there was a fre-<lb/>quent intercourse
                    between the two families.<lb/> Amongst a number of anecdotes relating to
                    the<lb/> Doctor, he recited one, respecting his religious<lb/> opinions, which
                    appeared to me worth preserving:<lb/> It is as follows:--At the time the Doctor
                    lay<lb/> near on his death-bed, he was visited by a young man<lb/> who had a
                    great respect for his judgment in all<lb/> things; and having entertained doubts
                    in his own<lb/> mind, as to the truth or the scriptures, he thought<lb/> that
                    this awful period, afforded a suitable oppor-<lb/>tunity of consulting the
                    Doctor on this important<lb/> subject. Accordingly he introduced it in a
                    solemn<lb/> weighty manner, inquiring of the Doctor what<lb/> were his
                    sentiments as to the truth of the scrip-<lb/>tures. On the question being put,
                    although he was<lb/> in a very weak state and near his close, he replied,<lb/>
                    <said who="bfrank1">Young man! my advice to you is, that you culti-<lb/> vate an
                        acquaintance with, and a firm belief in the<lb/> Holy Scriptures; this is
                        your certain interest.</said>

                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, at whose houses I<lb/> have been generously
                    entertained, was Captain H.<lb/> whom I had seen at Liverpool. I mention
                    his<lb/> name in this place, to introduce an account of a<lb/> remarkable
                    preservation which he experienced not<lb/> long ago, attended with some
                    circumstances ge-<lb/> nerally known in <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>:--He had been for<lb/> some time commander of a
                    ship in the East India<lb/> trade, and had acquitted himself so much to the<lb/>
                    satisfaction of his employers, that he was engaged<lb/> to go out again in that
                    trade, as commander of the<lb/> Hindostan, in which very large property was
                    em-<lb/> barked. The whole management of the outfit<lb/> had been committed to
                    his care, and every thing<lb/> being made ready for the voyage, the vessel
                    was<lb/> on the point of sailing. At this period he found<lb/> his mind so
                    oppressed at the prospect of the<lb/> voyage, that he felt himself under the
                    necessity of<lb/> requesting the owners of the ship, to liberate him<lb/> from
                    his engagement of taking the command; but<lb/> could assign no other reason than
                    the oppression<lb/> on his mind at the prospect of the voyage before<lb/> him;
                    observing, that he had no apprehension the<lb/> ship would not prosecute her
                    voyage in safety.<lb/> He further stated, that as far as concerned himself,<lb/>
                    <pb n="228" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_228"/> he could not feel satisfied to take the command of<lb/> her; but
                    considering his engagements, he was de-<lb/> termined to fulfil them as far as
                    lay in his power,<lb/> if it was <emph rend="italic">insisted</emph> upon. </p>
                <p>The owners, at first, seemed disposed to enforce<lb/> his compliance; yet, after
                    a little time of reflection,<lb/> they gave up the point, there being several
                    well-<lb/> qualified Captains ready to supply his place. The<lb/> command of an
                    Indiaman is a situation eagerly<lb/> sought after, being considered the most
                    profitable<lb/> of any in the commercial line, as it affords many<lb/>
                    opportunities of making larger profits than any<lb/> other trade. Another
                    Captain was accordingly<lb/> appointed in the place of Captain H. and the
                    Hin-<lb/> dostan left Philadelphia, in appearance as fine a<lb/> ship as had of
                    late sailed from that port; but she<lb/> was never heard of after she left the
                    Delaware. </p>
                <p>Thus was Captain H. preserved to his family<lb/> and friends, by duly attending
                    to those urgent,<lb/> though incomprehensible impressions upon his<lb/> mind.
                    Some years afterwards he brought over<lb/>
                    <persName key="mrout1">M. R.</persName> to England, on her return from her

                <p>I went to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, whence<lb/> I
                    transmitted some letters to my friends in Eng-<lb/> land by way of New-York;
                    and, in the afternoon,<lb/> in company with R. E. we rode over to J. H.'s, and<lb/>
                    <pb n="229" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_229"/> supped and spent the evening at his house on the<lb/> banks of the

                    farm, which appears to be well managed. The<lb/> road up to the house was
                    planted on each side<lb/> with English quicksets, which appeared to thrive<lb/>
                    better than any I had seen in this country, I un-<lb/>derstand that the winters
                    here are generally too<lb/> sharp for thorn, so that they rarely answer as a
                    fence.<lb/> However the native American thorn makes a good<lb/> hedge; and, in
                    some parts of the Delaware State,<lb/> I have seen it used to considerable
                    advantage. It<lb/> is a much greater ornament to a plantation, than<lb/> either
                    the common worm fence, or that of the posts<lb/> and rails which generally
                    prevails throughout the<lb/> United States. The farmers object to hedges in<lb/>
                    general, alleging that they harbour birds and ver-<lb/> min of different kinds,

                    well worthy of imitation, where soap is<lb/> an expensive article. In many
                    families it is the<lb/> custom to preserve the bones that are collected in<lb/>
                    the kitchen after a meal. When a sufficient quan-<lb/> tity is obtained, they
                    are put into a pan provided<lb/> for the purpose, and some lie, made from
                    wood<lb/> ashes, is poured upon them. The pan being placed<lb/> near the fire,
                    if the lie is of sufficient strength to<lb/>
                    <pb n="230" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_230"/> float an egg, it soon extracts all the fat; and dis-<lb/> solves
                    the gristly parts in the course of a day or two.<lb/> The bones are then taken
                    out, and the liquor is<lb/> left near the fire, and kept to a gentle boiling
                    heat,<lb/> or near it, another day or two; or until the liquor<lb/> has attained
                    a ropy consistency. It will then<lb/> answer all the purposes of soap; and, if a
                    proper<lb/> quantity of common salt be added, it hardens and<lb/> becomes real
                    soap. Many families in America<lb/> never use any other kind. </p>

                <p>I came to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and<lb/> attended the
                    first sitting of the <orgName key="pym">yearly meeting</orgName>,<lb/> which
                    began at ten o'clock this morning. The<lb/> number of friends attending was
                    great; but it<lb/> would be difficult to form a correct estimate of the<lb/>
                    whole; yet I suppose there were not less than two<lb/> thousand men friends
                    present. One of the door-<lb/> keepers at Arch-street meeting-house, where
                    the<lb/> women friends assembled to transact their busi-<lb/>ness, had the
                    curiosity to count them as they came<lb/> out; and found that upwards of
                    nineteen hundred<lb/> females had been assembled there. After open-<lb/>ing the
                    meeting, friends proceeded to answer the<lb/> queries, and went through seven of
                    them. It<lb/> was pleasant to observe that a large proportion of<lb/> those who
                    attended were young persons; to whom<lb/> many instructive observations were
                    made. After<lb/> an agreeable sitting of about two hours, the meet-<lb/> ing
                    adjourned until the afternoon. Between meet-<lb/>
                    <pb n="231" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_231"/>ings I dined and spent on hour two very plea-<lb/> santly at
                        <persName key="jelli1">John Elliot</persName>'s, where I had the
                    company<lb/> of many friends from different parts of the Con-<lb/> tinent of
                    America. </p>
                <p>In the afternoon I attended the second sitting<lb/> of the yearly meeting; when
                    the answers to the<lb/> remaining queries were read; and several reports<lb/>
                    respecting the establishment of schools, and the<lb/> instruction of the native
                    Indians, where brought in<lb/> and taken into consideration. </p>

                <p>At nine o'clock I attended<lb/> the third sitting of the yearly meeting. After
                    ap-<lb/>pointing a committee to hear and judge of an<lb/> appeal, the general
                    epistle from the yearly meeting<lb/> in London was read; and six thousand copies
                    of<lb/> it were ordered to be printed and distributed<lb/> through the inferior
                    meetings. Epistles from the<lb/> different yearly meetings on this continent
                    were<lb/> also read. </p>
                <p>After meeting I dined at <persName key="dbaco1">David Bacon</persName>'s, in<lb/>
                    company with H. J. a friend who had devoted<lb/> some years to the instruction
                    of the Indians, in the<lb/> useful arts of civilized life, during which time
                    he<lb/> dwelt amongst them on the banks of the <geogName key="alleg"
                        >Allegany<lb/> River</geogName>. From the conversation I had with this<lb/>
                    friend, as well as with others who had given up<lb/>
                    <pb n="232" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_232"/> much of their time to the same purpose, it will<lb/> probably be a
                    work of time, requiring a long<lb/> exercise of patience and perseverance,
                    before the<lb/> Indians can be brought into a state of complete<lb/>
                    civilization. It has often appeared to me that<lb/> there is a natural wildness
                    and quickness in them,<lb/> which all the pains or labour of the
                    well-disposed<lb/> white inhabitants, will find it difficult to subdue.<lb/>
                    However, there are different degrees of stability<lb/> and prudential care
                    amongst these people, in their<lb/> natural state; many amongst them paying
                    some<lb/> attention to agricultural pursuits, and, in summer,<lb/> providing for
                    the wants of winter; whilst others<lb/> disclaim all thought or care for the
                    future; and<lb/> hold in contempt all their neighbours, who depend<lb/> on any
                    other means for support than hunting.<lb/> Although friends reside amongst them,
                    they are<lb/> still, at certain times, in the practice of sacrificing<lb/> to
                    idols of their own carving, some of which were<lb/> in the form of an Indian
                    warrior of a gigantic<lb/> stature; to whom they sacrificed dogs, &amp;c.<lb/>
                    Notwithstanding this, they hold a tradition that<lb/> the universe was created,
                    and is supported, by an<lb/> all-powerful being, whom they call the Great<lb/>
                    Spirit; whose influence is felt in every human<lb/> breast, approving for good,
                    and reproving for evil. </p>

                <p>At three o'clock in the after-<lb/> noon of this may we met again, when the

                <p>We met again this morning<lb/> at nine o'clock, it being the fifth sitting;
                    when<lb/> the state of the society, as set forth in the<lb/> answers to the
                    queries, was taken into considera-<lb/> tion, and much advice was given on the
                    subject of<lb/> the deficiencies that appeared. </p>
                <p>We met again at three o'clock, it being the<lb/> sixth sitting; when the report
                    of the state of<lb/> West-Town school was read, and several subjects<lb/>
                    relating to that institution were considered. </p>

                <p>This forenoon, meetings for<lb/> worship were held at the three different
                    meeting-<lb/> houses in the city. In the afternoon, at three<lb/> o'clock, the
                    yearly meeting resumed its business,<lb/> this being the seventh sitting. The
                    Committee of<lb/> Appeals brought in their report in the case of<lb/> H. J. who
                    had appealed to the yearly meeting<lb/> against the decision of her monthly and
                    quarterly<lb/> meetings. In the opening of business, when<lb/> the appellant was
                    introduced by the men's<lb/> yearly meeting, and inquired of by the clerk,
                    if<lb/> she continued in the mind to prosecute her ap-<lb/> peal, she, in a
                    becoming manner, replied that she<lb/> came there for that purpose. After a fair and<lb/>
                    <pb n="234" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_234"/> candid hearing by the committee of the yearly<lb/> meeting,
                    appointed from the most impartial part<lb/> of it, this poor woman, who had
                    stood as it were<lb/> single and alone, was restored to her right of<lb/>
                    membership in the society. </p>
                <p>I believe that meetings for discipline sometimes<lb/> lose their proper weight
                    and authority, by active<lb/> members getting into a cold, unfeeling manner
                    of<lb/> treating those who may have been brought under<lb/> dealing. The habit
                    of constantly speaking to<lb/> cases which occur, endangers our getting into
                    a<lb/> customary form; and the mind, by this means,<lb/> runs considerable risk
                    of becoming less sensible<lb/> of the tendering impressions of divine
                    influ-<lb/> ence. It is well frequently to remember this great<lb/> truth, that
                    the more closely we attend to this sea-<lb/> soning virtue, the more will our
                    minds be clothed<lb/> with meekness and charity, and we shall thereby<lb/> be
                    preserved from doing or saying any thing that<lb/> may have a tendency to
                    irritate or wound, even<lb/> by the smallest delinquent. </p>
                <p>The business of the appeal being disposed of,<lb/> the propriety of continuing
                    the second day morn-<lb/> ing meeting was entered into; on which it was<lb/>
                    agreed, that the meeting should be discontinued,<lb/> and a minute to that
                    purpose was accordingly made.<lb/> A report from the <orgName key="pymind"
                        >Committee on Indian Affairs</orgName> was<lb/> brought in and read, with a
                    statement of the re-<lb/>
                    <pb n="235" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_235"/>ceipts and expenditure of the committee, by which<lb/> it appeared
                    that there remained a balance in the<lb/> hands of the treasurer, of about
                    2000l. currency; a<lb/> part of which sum was ordered to be handed to the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName> tribe of Indians, whose forefathers
                    had<lb/> shown great kindness to Friends, on their first<lb/> landing in this
                    country; the recollection of which<lb/> had great weight on Friends' minds at
                    this time, in<lb/> the distribution of this money. Thus the good<lb/> deeds of
                    the forefathers of this tribe of Indians,<lb/> were visited upon their
                    children's children, some<lb/> of whom stood in great need of the assistance
                    now<lb/> afforded, and to whom it would be very useful in<lb/> providing
                    husbandry utensils, &amp;c. &amp;c.; I observed<lb/> that friends were generally
                    careful not to hand<lb/> their presents in money; but preferred sending<lb/>
                    them various kinds of tools both for husbandry<lb/> and carpenters' work; and
                    they would also, on<lb/> some occasions, hire a workman to put them in a<lb/>
                    way of using their tools. </p>
                <p>After the close of this sitting, a friend informed<lb/> me that he had a prospect
                    of removing to the<lb/> Ohio, and shewed me two certificates of lands he<lb/>
                    had purchased in that State, said to be of excel-<lb/> lent quality, for which
                    he engaged to give 11s. 3d.<lb/> per acre, to be paid by instalments; at two,
                    three,<lb/> and four years. The number of friends who have<lb/> emigrated into
                    that State, in the course of the last<lb/> few years, is said to exceed 800
                    families; and their<lb/>
                    <pb n="236" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_236"/> increase still continued to be so great, that the<lb/>
                    establishment of a new yearly meeting in those<lb/> parts, began to be seriously
                    thought of. </p>

                <p>I attended the eighth sitting<lb/> of the yearly meeting, which began at ten

                    consideration of the report brought in by<lb/> the committee appointed to revise
                    the discipline. </p>
                <p>In the afternoon we met again, at three o'clock,<lb/> being the ninth sitting,
                    and proceeded in the con-<lb/> sideration of the report of the committee on

                <p>We met again at nine o'clock,<lb/> being the tenth sitting. Friends were
                    occupied<lb/> during the whole time on the revision of the dis-<lb/> cipline,
                    but chiefly on the subject of using and<lb/> dealing in spiritous liquors, and
                    of friends keeping<lb/> inns. Much was said to discourage the practice,<lb/> on
                    account of the exposed situation of the families<lb/> of those engaged in this
                    line of business. On the<lb/> other hand, it appeared to some, that were
                    all<lb/> inns in the hands of steady, consistent friends, it<lb/> would be a
                    great blessing to any country, and<lb/> would have a tendency considerably to
                    check that<lb/> torrent of profligacy and dissipation, which too<lb/> generally
                    prevails in inns and taverns. </p>

                <p>We met again at three o'clock in the afternoon,<lb/> it being the eleventh
                    sitting; when the meeting<lb/> proceeded in its deliberations on the revision

                <p>The first day of the week I<lb/> attended the North Meeting in the forenoon;
                    and<lb/> in the afternoon, that held in Market-street. At<lb/> the latter,
                        <persName key="rmott1">R. M.</persName> a friend from the neighbour-<lb/>
                    hood of New-York, in the course of his testimony,<lb/> explained the difference
                    between the terms wis-<lb/> dom and knowledge; the former embracing not<lb/>
                    only the knowledge of what is right, but also the<lb/> practice of it; for this
                    only, he said, was true<lb/> wisdom. On the other hand, how many, alas!<lb/> are
                    possessed of the knowledge of what is right<lb/> and good, but fall short in
                    firmness and integrity<lb/> to uphold and practice it. This, he said, was<lb/>
                    knowledge, but not wisdom. </p>

                    and afterwards had the company of<lb/> R. S. and A. K. of Philadelphia to

                    <pb n="239" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_239"/> two young men were both of them descendants of<lb/> German parents
                    who had left their native country,<lb/> in order to enjoy the blessings of
                    religious liberty<lb/> in this land; a privilege which neither the Em-<lb/>

                <p>This day was remarkably<lb/> tempestuous; and in the evening there was so<lb/>
                    great a light over the cities of <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> and<lb/>
                    <placeName key="wches">West Chester</placeName>, that they appeared to be on
                    fire;<lb/> and next morning we received accounts, that in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> 30 houses had been burnt
                    down<lb/> in a central part of the city, and that in <placeName key="wches"
                        >West<lb/> Chester</placeName> two large ships were burnt. Within about<lb/>
                    two miles of my lodgings the same evening, a<lb/> powder mill was blown up, and
                    one person who<lb/> had the management of it, lost his life by the ex-<lb/>
                    plosion. Not many days before the accident,<lb/> being well acquainted with the
                    man, I had some<lb/> conversation with him on the danger of his oc-<lb/>
                    cupation; but the great wages he received out-<lb/> weighed all apprehensions of
                    his danger, and he<lb/> seemed to have made up his mind to continue the<lb/>
                    employment, notwithstanding he had before been<lb/> blown up, and narrowly
                    escaped destruction, with<lb/> the loss of one eye, and the use of several of
                    his<lb/> fingers. So many dreadful accidents happening<lb/> around us at the
                    time called forth serious<lb/> and awful reflections. </p>

                <p>Being invited by one of the<lb/> proprietors, I accompanied him to the ruins of

                    appearance<lb/> was too shocking to be described. The afflicted<lb/> widow, who
                    was a young woman, and several<lb/> small children, stood weeping round him.

                <p>I had the company of R. J.<lb/> to tea this afternoon, who presented me with
                    an<lb/> account of a most extraordinary persecution that<lb/> was carried on in
                    the year 1763, against the last re-<lb/> maining part of a particular tribe of
                    Inndians.<lb/> This tribe, from their residing at Conestoga, were<lb/> called
                    the <orgName key="conestoga">Conestoga Indians</orgName>. On the first
                    arrival<lb/> of the English in Pennsylvania, they sent messengers<lb/> to
                    welcome them, with presents of venison, corn,<lb/> and skins; and entered into a
                    treaty of friendship<lb/> with William Penn. This treaty had been since<lb/>
                    frequently confirmed, and had never been violated,<lb/> either on the part of
                    the Indians or the English,<lb/> until the time that these cruel transactions took<lb/>
                    <pb n="241" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_241"/> place. It has always been observed that Indians,<lb/> settled in
                    the neighborhood of white people, con-<lb/> tinually diminish; and this tribe
                    had dwindled<lb/> away till there remained in the village no more<lb/> than
                    seven men, five women, and eight children.<lb/> Of these, Shebeas, who was a
                    very old man, had<lb/> assisted at the treaty with William Penn in the<lb/> year
                    1701, had ever since continued a faithful<lb/> friend of the English, and bore
                    the character of<lb/> an exceedingly good man; for, considering his<lb/>
                    extraction, he was naturally of a most kind and<lb/> benevolent temper. This
                    little remnant of Indians<lb/> were in the constant practice of addressing
                    every<lb/> new Governor of the Province, and they ac-<lb/> cordingly presented
                    an address to <persName key="jpenn2">John Penn</persName>, a<lb/> new Governor,
                    on his arrival; assuring him of their<lb/> fidelity, and praying for a
                    continuance of that<lb/> favour and protection they had hitherto experienced. </p>
                <p>This address was scarcely presented, when the<lb/> horrible catastrophe occurred,
                    which I am about to<lb/> relate. In the townships of Paxton and Done-<lb/> gal,
                    in the county of Lancaster, a number of peo-<lb/> ple, actuated by the wildest
                    religious enthusiasm,<lb/> in which they were encouraged by some furious<lb/>
                    zealots amongst their preachers, conceived the<lb/> notion that they ought to
                    extirpate the heathen<lb/> from the earth, as Joshua did some nations of
                    old;<lb/> that they themselves, as Saints, might possess the<lb/> land. Fired
                    with this dreadful kind of zeal, on<lb/>
                    <pb n="242" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_242"/> the 14th of the 12th Month, 1763, 57 men well<lb/> mounted, and
                    armed with firelocks, hatchets, and<lb/> hangers, came down from the two
                    before-mentioned<lb/> townships, and, surrounding the little Indian vil-<lb/>
                    lage at dawn of day, broke in upon the inhabitants<lb/> all at once, and fired
                    upon, stabbed, and hewed in<lb/> pieces the poor defenceless creatures who
                    hap-<lb/> pened to be in their huts; among them the good<lb/> old Shebeas was
                    hewed in pieces in his bed. The<lb/> daughter of the venerable Shebeas, who for
                    several<lb/> years past had devoted her time to waiting upon<lb/> her beloved
                    father, was also slain. After taking<lb/> off the scalps of those who were thus
                    murdered, and<lb/> setting fire to the village, the murderers mounted<lb/> their
                    horses and rode away; disappointed in not<lb/> having found all the Indians at
                    home, 14 out of the<lb/> 20 being absent. It is not, perhaps, in the power
                    of<lb/> language to express the feelings of the remaining<lb/> 14 Indians, some
                    of whom were little children, on<lb/> their return to the village, when they
                    beheld the<lb/> mangled remains of their near and dear connexions,<lb/> and saw
                    their habitations a heap of smoking ruins. </p>
                <p>The Magistrates of Lancaster, hearing of what<lb/> had past, came over and took
                    the survivors under<lb/> their protection, doing all in their power to con-<lb/>
                    sole them; and, taking them by the hand, led them<lb/> to Lancaster; where, for
                    their greater security,<lb/> they lodged them in a strong stone building in
                    the<lb/> town, in which they were supposed to be in per-<lb/>
                    <pb n="243" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_243"/>fect safety. The Governor, <persName key="jpenn2">John
                        Penn</persName>, imme-<lb/>diately issued a proclamation, enjoining all
                    officers<lb/> both civil and Military, to assist in bringing to<lb/> justice the
                    perpetrators of this horrid outrage. </p>
                <p>The remaining 14 Indians continued in the house<lb/> provided for them in
                    Lancaster, in the centre of<lb/> the town, unconscious of danger, till the 27th
                    of<lb/> the 12th Month, being 13 days from the time their<lb/> village had been
                    destroyed. On that day a com-<lb/> pany of men, 50 in number, well mounted
                    and<lb/> armed, rode hastily into Lancaster, made the best<lb/> of their way to
                    the house where the poor Indians<lb/> were lodged; with violence broke open the
                    door;<lb/> and with fury in their countenances rushed in upon<lb/> these unarmed
                    and defenceless creatures. The In-<lb/>dians seeing no protection nigh, nor and
                    possibility<lb/> of escape, immediately divided into their little<lb/> families;
                    the affrighted children clinging to their<lb/> distressed parents. In
                    unutterable anguish they<lb/> fell upon their knees, protesting their love to
                    the<lb/> English people, and that in their whole lives, they<lb/> had never done
                    them any injury. While thus im-<lb/> ploring mercy of these hard-hearted men,
                    they<lb/> were without distinction, hewn down with hatchets,<lb/> and, in a few
                    moments, were laid lifeless on the<lb/> floor; a deplorable instance amongst
                    many others,<lb/> of what a pitch of wickedness the mind of man<lb/>
                    <pb n="244" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_244"/> may be brought to, where acting under wrong im-<lb/>pressions of
                    imagined religious zeal. This cruel<lb/> massacre was completed in one of the
                    largest in-<lb/> lands towns in America, in the broad face of day,<lb/> and in
                    so public a manner, that after the commission<lb/> of this atrocious murder, the
                    miscreants all came<lb/> out and stood at the door of the house, besmeared<lb/>
                    with blood, gave three loud huzzas, mounted their<lb/> horses, and rode away.
                    Notwithstanding this pub-<lb/>licity, and a proclamation by <persName
                        key="jpenn2">John Penn</persName>, the Go-<lb/> vernor, offering a reward of
                    200l. for the discovery<lb/> of any of them, yet such was the dread in
                    which<lb/> they were held, that none of them were brought<lb/> to justice. </p>

                <p>I attended the <orgName key="meetvall2">Valley<lb/> meeting</orgName> at which I
                    noticed some of the <orgName key="dunkers">Dunkers</orgName>.<lb/> They are a
                    religious society who make a point of<lb/> never taking off the beard. I
                    observed a comely<lb/> looking young man, whose beard had so luxuriant<lb/> a
                    growth, that it spread a considerable way over<lb/> his breast, and gave him a
                    very patriarchal ap-<lb/> pearance. At the close of the meeting several<lb/>
                    friends invited me to their houses, but being pre-<lb/>viously engaged, I
                    accompanied M. R. and dined<lb/> with him. After dinner he shewed me his
                    barn,<lb/> stables, &amp;c. which are the most complete I have<lb/> seen either
                    in England or America. The barn is<lb/> of stone and stands on descending
                    ground, having<lb/> a south aspect. It is about 40 yards in length by<lb/> 10 in
                    breadth, and 9 yards high in front. Along<lb/> the north side of the barn is a
                    range of vaults<lb/> which communicate with it, and are on the same<lb/> level
                    with the barn. The centre vault, which com-<lb/>municates with the cow-house, is
                    fitted up as a<lb/>
                    <pb n="246" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_246"/> dairy; and the other vaults are made use of to<lb/> preserve
                    roots, &amp;c. for the cattle, such as beets,<lb/> carrots, turnips, potatoes,
                    pumpkins, &amp;c. As the<lb/> carriage-road into the barn runs over the
                    vaults,<lb/> as high as the topmost floor of the barn, the vaults<lb/> are
                    preserved cool in the summer, and free from<lb/> the frost in winter. The whole
                    of the ground<lb/> floor of the barn being set apart for stables and<lb/>
                    cow-houses as is commonly the case with barns<lb/> in Pennsylvania, there is
                    accommodation for a<lb/> great number of horses and cows. Along the<lb/> front
                    of the barn, about 8 feet from the ground, a<lb/> wooden stage projects about
                    six feet from the<lb/> wall, inclosed overhead six or seven feet high, and<lb/>
                    also at the ends and side, forming a gallery the<lb/> length of the building;
                    having several communi-<lb/>cations or doorways out of the barn into it. In<lb/>
                    the floor of this gallery are several trap doors,<lb/> through which they throw
                    fodder for the cattle into<lb/> the yard during the winter months. It is
                    obvious<lb/> that an appendage of this sort must be very useful<lb/> in a
                    farm-yard, as it also affords a comfortable<lb/> shelter to the cattle from rain
                    and snow. </p>
                <p>In the afternoon M. R. accompanied me to my<lb/> cousin W. B.'s, and, in our way,
                    we passed over<lb/> the ground occupied by the American Army under<lb/>
                    <persName key="gwash1">General Washington</persName>, as an entrenched
                    camp,<lb/> during the war. The remains of the entrench-<lb/>ments are still
                    visible, although the scite is again<lb/>
                    <pb n="247" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_247"/> become a thick wood; so rapid is vegetation in<lb/> this part of
                    the world. </p>
                <p>After fording the <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName>, which is here
                    broad<lb/> and shallow, having several islands in it covered<lb/> with lofty
                    trees, we came upon W. B.'s plantation,<lb/> and soon afterwards reached his
                    habitation. We<lb/> found the family sitting in the shade of the piazza,<lb/> in
                    the front of the house, where we joined them<lb/> in taking tea, and enjoyed the
                    freshness of the<lb/> breeze, and a beautiful prospect of a great part<lb/> of
                    the country between his house and Philadelphia,<lb/> a distance of about 20
                    miles; and in the plea-<lb/>santest part of Pennsylvania. The privilege of<lb/>
                    sitting under the shade of these piazzas, enjoying<lb/> the fresh air in the
                    afternoons and evenings, fully<lb/> compensates for any inconvenience that is
                    suffered<lb/> from the heat, in the warmest part of the day.<lb/> These piazzas
                    are commonly six feet wide with<lb/> boarded floors. On seeing families seated
                    in them<lb/> in their tranquil summer evenings, it constantly<lb/> reminded me
                    of the patriarchs of old, sitting at the<lb/> doors of their tents in the cool
                    of the day. </p>

                    Hitherto the farmers in<lb/>
                    <pb n="248" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_248"/> this part of the world, have paid but little attention<lb/> to
                    their sheep, suffering the butchers to select<lb/> the best formed for the
                    market, leaving the most<lb/> ordinary for stock. The natural consequence
                    of<lb/> such a plan was that the breed continually dege-<lb/> nerated. Against
                    this mode of proceeding my<lb/> relation had the good sense to remonstrate, and
                    to<lb/> reserve for stock the best part of his flock. The<lb/> beneficial
                    effects of this plan are so manifest, that<lb/> I have no doubt the neighbouring
                    farmers will be<lb/> induced to follow his example. I think I have<lb/> before
                    noticed how fond the cattle are of salt in<lb/> these parts. At the front of the
                    house is a beau-<lb/> tiful lawn of many acres, gently descending to-<lb/> wards
                    the <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName>, in which nearly 100 sheep<lb/>
                    were feeding; and so partial were they to salt,<lb/> that I have seen the girls
                    go amongst them with a<lb/> handful of it, and by scattering a little
                    amongst<lb/> them, entice the whole flock up to the house. </p>

                    chiefly by persons of other persua-<lb/>
                    <pb n="249" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_249"/>sions; amongst them, were one Senator, four<lb/> Judges, and four
                    Magistrates, who all behaved in<lb/> a becoming manner. This friend is far
                    advanced<lb/> in years, and much esteemed by friends in Phila-<lb/>delphia and
                    the neighbourhood; yet he follows<lb/> the occupation of a broom-maker, and

                <p>This day was remarkable for<lb/> an almost total eclipse of the sun. About
                    eleven<lb/> o'clock in the forenoon, I passed along the road<lb/> from my
                    lodgings to H. B.'s, when all seemed as<lb/> quiet as at midnight; some stars
                    appearing, and<lb/> the birds being gone to roost. Although not so<lb/> dark as
                    it commonly is in the night, yet there was<lb/> something awful in the stillness
                    and appearance of<lb/> the scene, there being scarcely a breath of air<lb/>
                    stirring. The portion of the sun that was visible,<lb/> was only about a 24th
                    part, and it cast a faint<lb/> glimmering light through the leaves of the
                    trees,<lb/> the shadows of which appeared like shell-work<lb/> upon the

                <p>The weather now becoming<lb/> warm, I had noticed several little boys and

                    without shoes and<lb/>

                    having long cot-<lb/>ton trowsers which came down to their shoe tops.<lb/> One

                    appearances in dress are not familiar to an English-<lb/>man, yet habit soon
                    reconciles us to them. And a<lb/> person who has not experienced it, can hardly

                <p>I this morning paid a visit<lb/> to J. J. and his wife, at their habitation.
                    This<lb/> family, with many others I have met with, contra-<lb/> dict a notion
                    which prevails in England, <q>That<lb/> the Americans are generally short
                        lived.</q> The<lb/> husband is in his 95th year, and his wife in her<lb/>
                    89th year. One of his sisters is of the same age,<lb/> and another sister is in
                    her 85th year; and all of<lb/> them may, from every appearance, live some
                    years<lb/> longer. J. J. told me, that he had often heard his<lb/> father speak
                    of his having seen the foundation laid<lb/> of the first house that was built in
                    Philadelphia;<lb/> and I understood that he was one of <persName key="wpenn1"
                        >William<lb/> Penn</persName>'s most intimate friends. </p>
                <p>I spent this evening at B. J.'s country residence.<lb/> This house, which is
                    substantial and well built,<lb/>
                    <pb n="252" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_252"/> and finished in an expensive manner, stands on<lb/> a rising
                    ground just above the Falls of the <geogName key="schri">Schuyl-<lb/>
                        kill</geogName>, commanding a fine prospect of <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> and the river <placeName key="delaw"
                        >Delaware</placeName>, both above and below<lb/> that city, being only about
                    four miles distant.<lb/> The prospect embraces many beautiful country<lb/>
                    residences on every hand. B. J. had lately made<lb/> a purchase of the house and
                    35 acres of land<lb/> adjoining. In this purchase was also included a<lb/> good
                    farm-house, with an orchard, garden, out-<lb/> houses, and a cottage or two. In
                    one of these<lb/> cottages, close by the Falls, a family resides, who<lb/> are
                    employed by B. J. in the book-binding busi-<lb/> ness. The situation is as
                    pleasant as can well be<lb/> conceived. </p>
                <p>At this part of the river, the Shad Fishery<lb/> is prosecuted with great spirit
                    in the early<lb/> part of summer. Almost every farmer who hap-<lb/> pens to have
                    a field on the banks of the river,<lb/> keeps a net for this purpose; and, with
                    a little<lb/> industry, may, in the course of two or three weeks,<lb/> lay up a
                    supply for the whole year. The fish are<lb/> salted, and are brought out,
                    through the winter, as<lb/> a relish at breakfast and supper. </p>
                <p>I have some times stood by in the evening watch-<lb/> ing the people taking these
                    fish. The nets used are<lb/> about 50 or 60 yards in length, and about 6 feet
                    in<lb/> width; the lower side being weighted with lead, and<lb/> upper side
                    supported with pieces of cork. One<lb/>
                    <pb n="253" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_253"/> end of the net is fixed firm to a stake on edge<lb/> of the river,
                    whilst the other end is taken out in<lb/> a small boat towards the other side.
                    After getting<lb/> to the extent of it, the boat is rowed down the<lb/> river,
                    bringing the end of the net with it, and<lb/> at length it comes to land, a
                    little below the stake<lb/> to which the other end of the net is fastened,<lb/>
                    forming a circular inclosure, within which the fish<lb/> are secured. As the net
                    approaches the bank of<lb/> the river, the fishes are seen struggling in all
                    di-<lb/> rections; till at last they are brought close to the<lb/> above, when
                    they are quickly gathered up, and<lb/> thrown into the boat. Several hundreds
                    are, at<lb/> times, taken at one draught; but as the fishing is<lb/> continued
                    through the night, during the season, the<lb/> farmers often think themselves
                    well paid with 20<lb/> or 30, as they weigh about 5 pounds each. </p>
                <p>In the early part of the season, I think the shad<lb/> is nearly equal to trout.
                    Although the practice<lb/> of eating it at breakfast and supper, is not
                    com-<lb/> mon in England, I soon found myself very par-<lb/> tial to the shad at
                    breakfast, with coffee and toast,<lb/> it being first nicely broiled over the
                    hot embers of<lb/> a wood fire. </p>

                    his fowling-piece, and shot one<lb/> of them; and on opening the craw, we

                    luxuriance; and, when the grapes are ripe,<lb/> present a very inviting
                    appearance. They are of a<lb/> small black kind, and very pleasant to the
                    palate,<lb/> particularly in pies and tarts; in which, according<lb/> to the
                    taste, they exceed almost every other kind<lb/> of fruit. They are often
                    preserved in jars, for<lb/> this purpose to be used in winter. Some of the<lb/>

                    <pb n="256" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_256"/> we drank tea. Before we left his house, he gave<lb/> us a taste of
                    his cyder, made from a species of<lb/> apple, called the Virginia crab, the
                    produce of his<lb/> own orchard. It was superior to any liquor I have<lb/> ever
                    tasted of the kind; indeed I have seldom drank<lb/> a glass of wine equal to it,
                    either as to body or<lb/> flavour. </p>
                <p>Afterwards we called upon D. J. an ancient<lb/> friend, whose parents were
                    amongst the first set-<lb/> tlers of this province. In the evening we
                    called<lb/> upon J. Z. a friend whose progenitors came from<lb/> Germany. On my
                    noticing a number of fine hogs<lb/> in his orchard, which appeared very
                    attentive to<lb/> the fall of the fruit, he told me that he annually<lb/>
                    brought up about twenty of them, which derived a<lb/> great part of their
                    support from peaches, apples,<lb/> &amp;c. during the day; and, in the evenings
                    and<lb/> mornings, they were supplied with milk from his<lb/> dairy. As he made
                    a considerable quantity of<lb/> butter for the Philadelphia market, the old
                    milk<lb/> and butter milk went in aid of the fruit in the<lb/> orchard, to bring
                    forward the hogs, which are<lb/> fatted with Indian corn, at the close of the
                    year,<lb/> to a large size. </p>

                <p>In the evening we called upon<lb/> H. B. who was engaged amongst his reapers
                    in<lb/> the wheat field. He calculated that his produce<lb/> this year would be
                    30 bushels of wheat per acre;<lb/>
                    <pb n="257" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_257"/> an increase which must pay the farmer well,<lb/> where the land,

                <p>The evening being serene and<lb/> pleasant, I took a walk in company with

                    Although this may be deemed<lb/> the hottest season of the year, I found no
                    incon-<lb/> venience from the exercise of walking, but it<lb/> must be
                    remembered that our clothing was very<lb/> light. In passing along we were
                    entertained with<lb/> the appearance of immense quantities of fire flies,
                    in<lb/> the fields and woods around us. They had the<lb/> appearance of immense
                    quantities of bright sparks<lb/> of fire, flying in all directions amongst the
                    grass<lb/> and corn, as well as the leaves and boughs of the<lb/> loftiest
                    trees. </p>

                <p>Having been several times<lb/> kindly invited, I dined with P. W. a

                        >Merion</placeName>,<lb/> where I spent the afternoon pleasantly. The<lb/>
                    situation is beautifully romantic, being in a deep<lb/> narrow valley, the steep
                    hills on each side of which<lb/> are covered with wood. The mill which
                    would<lb/> be considered as an extensive one even in England,<lb/> almost wholly
                    employed in making writing and<lb/>
                    <pb n="258" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_258"/> printing paper, with large quantities of which he<lb/> supplies
                    the printers and stationers in Philadelphia.<lb/> During the visit he gave me a
                    little history of his<lb/> life. About 20 years ago, being then 12 years of<lb/>
                    age, he left Mentz, his native place in Germany,<lb/> accompanied by his father,
                    who died on the pas-<lb/> sage to this country. Being of that class of emi-<lb/>
                    grants called redemptioners already mentioned,<lb/> P. W. on the arrival of the
                    ship in the Delaware,<lb/> was hired by <persName key="hdrin1">Henry
                        Drinker</persName>, and was employed<lb/> about the house as a waiting boy,
                    and assistant to<lb/> the girls in the kitchen. After spending nearly<lb/> four
                    months in this family, and having acquired the<lb/> English language, he had the
                    good sense to dis-<lb/> cern, that it would be more to his interest to be<lb/>
                    taught some manufacture; and requested liberty<lb/> of his master to be put
                    apprentice to a paper-<lb/> maker, which was readily granted, although his<lb/>
                    first indenture was not yet expired. After having<lb/> obtained a knowledge of
                    the manufacture of paper,<lb/> he, by industry and care, acquired sufficient
                    pro-<lb/> perty and credit to enable him to begin business;<lb/> which he has
                    now, for several years, carried on to<lb/> advantage. I never was in a
                    paper-mill where<lb/> the business was managed with more neatness and<lb/>
                    order. As I sat in the house it was pleasant to<lb/> reflect on such an instance
                    of successful industry.<lb/> He has a rising family of healthy looking
                    children<lb/> about him, with an amiable wife and several<lb/> sisters. </p>

                <p>In returning to my lodgings, I had the curiosity<lb/> to take the dimensions of a
                    chesnut tree, of the<lb/> sweet kind, which stood by the way side; and<lb/>
                    round it more than 27 feet in circumference, and<lb/> its thickness continued in
                    regular proportion to<lb/> the height of about seven yards, which was the<lb/>
                    length of the bole, clear of branches. </p>

                <p>I have noticed for a day or<lb/> two past, that the harvest for wheat, rye,

                    field, makes short work of it. It is not customary<lb/> here, as in England, for
                    the women to work<lb/> in the harvest field at all. In this neighbourhood<lb/>
                    the blacksmiths, wheelwrights, weavers, taylors,<lb/> &amp;c. &amp;c. all shut

                    continues to<lb/> be an active, lively woman. At her house I was<lb/> shewn a
                    deed of conveyance, of five thousand acres<lb/> of land, the purchase-money for
                    which was one<lb/> hundred pounds, reserving a quit-rent to <persName

                    land, where inclosed, now sells for 12l. per acre,<lb/> being a six hundred fold
                    advance in the course of<lb/> 120 years, on the intrinsic value of the land.
                    The<lb/> above-mentioned deed was a conveyance from<lb/> Charles Lloyd, and a

                    This deed is in the hands of M. P's daughter-<lb/> in-law, who is a descendant

                    Lewis-Town, near the<lb/> mouth of the Delaware. Although not more<lb/> than 25
                    years old, his loss will be severely felt by<lb/>
                    <pb n="261" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_261"/> the black people in that neighbourhood. He had<lb/> been an ardent
                    and steady friend to that oppressed<lb/> race, and the means of rescuing many of
                    them<lb/> from a state of slavery, who had been cruelly<lb/> forced into
                    bondage, by a set of unprincipled<lb/> men, from Georgia, who sometimes
                    hover<lb/> about this part of the Delaware State and Mary-<lb/> land, and carry
                    off whole families of free Negroes<lb/> in the night. They take them on board
                    small<lb/> vessels, in the neighbouring creeks, and so ship<lb/> them off to
                    Georgia and the Carolinas, where<lb/> they are sold to the planters. </p>
                <p>I have seen several of the black people whom<lb/> he had rescued and sent up to
                    his brother-in-law,<lb/>
                    <persName key="hbowm1">Henry Bowman</persName>. The latter had procured
                    them<lb/> situations in the interior of Pennsylvania, out of<lb/> the reach of
                    these barbarous men. Not long ago,<lb/> a mother, with seven children, was thus
                    carried<lb/> off, in the dead of the night, from this neighbour-<lb/> hood. This
                    flagrant act deeply excited <persName key="jrowl1">J. Row-<lb/>
                    land</persName>'s attention; and, after riding nearly one thou-<lb/> sand miles,
                    he was enabled to rescue the whole<lb/> family, and bring them safe home to
                    their native<lb/> place, although they had been dispersed and sold<lb/> into
                    various hands, by the kidnappers, in different<lb/> parts of Georgia. </p>
                <p>A very short time back, this excellent young<lb/> man was taken ill of a fever,
                    which, notwith-<lb/> standing every help was afforded him, made so<lb/>
                    <pb n="262" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_262"/> regular yet rapid a progress, that in a few days<lb/> all hopes of
                    his recovery were at an end. Through<lb/> the whole, his mind was preserved calm
                    and se-<lb/> rene, and, when sensible that the closing period<lb/> of time was
                    at band, he requested that his<lb/> domestics might be called into the room.
                    These<lb/> consisted of two white servants, two Negro<lb/> boys, and a little
                    orphan girl, whose mother had<lb/> been many years a nurse in the family, out
                    of<lb/> respect to whom, he supported and educated the<lb/> child. The mind may
                    conceive the situation<lb/> and feelings of this little group, yet I am ready
                    to<lb/> believe it is impossible for the pen to describe it.<lb/> After a short
                    but awful pause, he addressed each<lb/> of them in the language and accents of a
                    father;<lb/> for indeed as a parent he had always conducted<lb/> himself towards
                    them. Having communicated to<lb/> them counsel and advice suited to their
                    several<lb/> sizes and condition, he gently turned his face<lb/> from them, and
                    quietly resigned himself, and left the<lb/> world without a sigh or struggle; a
                    bright example<lb/> of faithfulness to his Divine Master, and a more<lb/>
                    intelligible exposition of the Gospel of Jesus<lb/> Christ, than whole volumes

                    feet in circumference.<lb/> He added, that on using extraordinary exertion,<lb/>

                    somewhat<lb/> resembling a tuft of feathers. The leaves or blades<lb/> which
                    shoot from the stalk, and branch from it<lb/> all the way up, are about the
                    breadth of four<lb/> inches, and from two to three feet in length. The<lb/>

                    India calicoes, which<lb/> are brought in great quantities to Philadelphia,
                    in<lb/> American ships trading to the West Indies. </p>

                <p>In the course of this day,<lb/> 0. J. and his mother-in-law called upon us.
                    This<lb/> venerable female, who is now far advanced in<lb/> years, has survived
                    a numerous flock of lovely<lb/> daughters, I think 10 in number, who have,
                    in<lb/> succession, been taken away from the troubles of<lb/> time, just as the
                    affections of a mother would be<lb/> likely to feel most keenly the privation. </p>
                <p>I had often remarked a settled grief upon her<lb/> countenance, notwithstanding
                    the affluence that<lb/> was manifest in every thing around her; but had<lb/>
                    <pb n="265" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_265"/> not heard the mournful story till I had it from her<lb/> own
                    mouth. </p>

                <p>I had received several kind<lb/> invitations from both J. and C. S. to pay them
                    a<lb/> visit at their habitations, at <placeName key="shoe">Shoemakers

                    falling at this time, I proposed<lb/> embracing both objects; and, setting out

                    entertained, and had the agreeable com-<lb/> pany of several friends from

                <p>After breakfast we returned<lb/> to J. S.'s, where we spent an hour or two
                    plea-<lb/> santly, with a number of valuable friends resident<lb/> in this
                    quarter. The weather was very warm,<lb/> but the house was spacious, with wide passages<lb/>
                    <pb n="266" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_266"/> through it, and no want of windows; and they with<lb/> the doors
                    being thrown open, it gave a free and<lb/> lively circulation to the air, which
                    is very reviving<lb/> in this climate. </p>
                <p>After sitting a little time in the parlour, a cir-<lb/> cumstance occurred which
                    I think I shall not soon<lb/> forget. We entered into general conversation,<lb/>
                    after which a silent pause ensued; and as I sat<lb/> musing on the prospect of
                    my voyage home, with<lb/> some little anxiety respecting the perils of it,
                    a<lb/> friend of Philadelphia, who sometimes appears in<lb/> the ministry, broke
                    the silence that prevailed, by<lb/> remarking that his mind had been occupied
                    in<lb/> the consideration of my voyage, and that for my<lb/> encouragement he
                    might say, he had a belief that<lb/> I should be favoured to arrive safe in my
                    native<lb/> land, in two months from that time. No observa-<lb/> tion was now
                    made on this intimation, but, on<lb/> reaching my lodgings, I wrote to my wife
                    inform-<lb/> ing her of the circumstance, and that I trusted the<lb/> friend
                    would prove a true prophet. My letter<lb/> reached her hands two or three weeks
                    previously<lb/> to my landing. </p>
                <p>After spending the morning as above related,<lb/> most of us attended a public
                    meeting at <placeName key="germa">German-<lb/> town</placeName>, about six or
                    seven miles distant, and being<lb/> requested by T. F. I accompanied him with
                    seve-<lb/> ral other friends to his country house, which he<lb/>
                    <pb n="267" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_267"/> calls Wakefield. There we dined in a room on a<lb/> level with the
                    cellar, which I found very pleasant,<lb/> the weather being very warm, and the
                    situation<lb/> admitting plenty of light. A dining-room so situ-<lb/> ated, is a
                    great privilege at this season of the year,<lb/> in a climate like this. </p>
                <p>After spending a pleasant hour or two here I<lb/> came to <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, where I found letters from<lb/> my wife of as
                    late a date as towards the end of the<lb/> 5th month. In riding along the
                    street, I passed<lb/> by J. G's house, and his wife, a native of Lan-<lb/>
                    caster, kindly inviting me to take tea, I spent a<lb/> little time with them,
                    and in the evening returned<lb/> to my lodgings at <placeName key="merio"
                        >Merion</placeName>. </p>
                <p>In recurring to the intimation respecting the<lb/> time of my return to England,
                    there are several<lb/> circumstances attending it, which I think are<lb/> worthy
                    of remembrance, though they are a little<lb/> out of the regular course of my
                    narrative. It has<lb/> been already mentioned, that it was my inten-<lb/> tion
                    to sail in the John Morgan, but that I was<lb/> disappointed by the owners
                    making an alteration in<lb/> the time for her departure. After this T. W.
                    and<lb/> I had concluded to sail for Greenock, in the<lb/> Frances, she being a
                    fine, new vessel with good<lb/> accommodation; but in this design I was again
                    dis-<lb/> appointed, the ship sailing before I could be quite<lb/> ready. In her
                    passage she encountered a violent<lb/>
                    <pb n="268" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_268"/> storm, which nearly reduced her to a wreck; and<lb/> such were the
                    difficulties the ship's company had<lb/> to encounter, that several of the
                    passengers and<lb/> seamen lost their lives. Notwithstanding I was fa-<lb/>
                    voured to escape these imminent perils, there was<lb/> considerable probability
                    of my not reaching Eng-<lb/> land by the time mentioned; as I still remained
                    at<lb/> New-York, when it wanted only about four weeks<lb/> to the completion of
                    that period; and after we got<lb/> on board, we were detained on the American
                    coast<lb/> nearly two weeks, by calms and light winds. Yet<lb/> we crossed the
                    Atlantic ocean from thence in the<lb/> short period of 9 days. On the <date
                        when="1806-08-10">10th</date> day, and<lb/> 23d of our voyage, we made
                    soundings off Cape<lb/> Clear, and on the 26th day landed safely at Liver-<lb/>
                    pool, where I was affectionately received by my<lb/> near relations in that
                    town, within the time which<lb/> the friend had predicted I should return. I
                    for-<lb/> bear making any farther comments on these cir-<lb/> cumstances. But in
                    the course of events I felt<lb/> in my heart the sentiments of humble
                    thankfulness<lb/> to the great Preserver of Men. </p>

                <p>I spent this day at J. H's<lb/> in company with M.
                        E. from Elklands. She was<lb/> then on a visit to her father, who

                    prived him of the use of speech; yet I have seldom<lb/> seen a man preserved in

                <p>A friend in the neighbour-<lb/> hood gave me an account of an acquaintance
                    of<lb/> his, a native of Ireland, but who now resides<lb/> near Lancaster, in
                    the State of Pennsylvania,<lb/> which I think worth preserving. This person<lb/>
                    left Ireland when he was nearly 16 years old, and<lb/> his whole property when
                    he landed amounted only<lb/> to about 12 guineas. He has now established<lb/>
                    extensive iron works where he resides, in which<lb/> he employs towards of 50
                    waggon teams; and the<lb/> profits of which, last year, amounted to
                    twenty-five<lb/> thousand pounds. What makes it the more re-<lb/> markable is,
                    that two persons possessing a large<lb/> capital had been ruined some time
                    before, in an<lb/> attempt to establish the same concern. </p>

                <p>In walking out this evening,<lb/> I met with two German families on their way
                    to<lb/> he Ohio. On entering into conversation with<lb/> them, they informed me,
                    that they were yet 500<lb/> miles distant from the place of their
                    destination.<lb/> The were a company of fine, healthy looking<lb/> people, and
                    travelled along with apparent chear-<lb/> fulness. The older females and the
                    little ones were<lb/> upon beds in their covered waggons, whilst the<lb/>
                    <pb n="270" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_270"/> young women, with their husbands, fathers, and<lb/> brothers went
                    on foot. Parties of this sort I have<lb/> often seen travelling along, in the
                    old Patriar-<lb/> chal style, seeking a country where they hoped to<lb/> meet
                    with more tranquillity and repose, than they<lb/> had witnessed in the old
                    principalities of Germany. </p>
                <p>Considering the stability and industry, which so<lb/> eminently characterize most
                    of the German emi-<lb/> grants, I am inclined to believe that things must
                    be<lb/> very much out of order, in their native land, before<lb/> men like them,
                    would come to the resolution of<lb/> taking a final farewell of their near
                    connexions<lb/> and friends; with the perils and inconveniences of<lb/> so long

                <p>I paid a visit to our neigh-<lb/> bour Doctor H. After tea we called upon a
                    family<lb/> of the name of Crow, where I saw a little esta-<lb/>blishment just
                    as it stood in the first settlement of<lb/> the country. It consisted of a small
                    workshop,<lb/> containing a set of tools proper for blacksmiths<lb/> and
                    carpenters, which at that period, must have<lb/> been an almost invaluable
                    appendage to a farm-<lb/>house. The Doctor complained to us that he had<lb/>
                    lately lost nearly the whole of his ducks and geese;<lb/> which had been
                    devoured by a large species of<lb/> tortoise. This animal creeping on the bottom
                    of<lb/> the pond, seizes the unsuspecting fowls by the<lb/> feet, and dragging
                    them under water, eats them<lb/>
                    <pb n="271" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_271"/> at his leisure. The Doctor had a respectable esta-<lb/>blishment
                    for the education of his children; having<lb/> an exclusive library, with a pair
                    of large globes,<lb/> and an amiable young woman from England as<lb/> tutors,
                    who was well qualified for her office, his<lb/> children being mostly girls.

                <p>I went over to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>;<lb/> and having

                    The Doctor is one amongst the few of that<lb/> profession, who retain their
                    integrity, by continu-<lb/> ing to be consistent members of our society;
                    and<lb/> he is a very useful member of the monthly meeting<lb/> to which he

                    sentiments<lb/> of esteem, and of gratitude for the many instances<lb/> of their
                    kind attentions to me. While in this city, I<lb/> received letters from my wife

                <pb n="272" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_272"/>
                <p>After meeting, we accepted an invitation from<lb/> J. C. and dined at his house,

                    and mother, ten daughters and one son; being a<lb/> fair sample of an American
                    farmer's family. I<lb/> was informed that his neighbour D. G. a respec-<lb/>
                    table farmer, with whom I have often been in<lb/> company, has ten sons and one
                    daughter. </p>
                <p>Considering the accounts I had read, of the<lb/> homely fare and accommodations

                    of the carriages we saw on the road, in<lb/> going from meeting to the house
                    where we dined;<lb/> part of the way lying through the forest, and some<lb/>
                    part through a country in a high state of cultiva-<lb/> tion, the prospects were

                <p>In our way home, we took tea at the pro-<lb/>prietor's of an extensive marble
                    quarry, who<lb/> kindly conducted us into it; where we had an op-<lb/> portunity
                    of seeing the people at work, in sepa-<lb/>rating large blocks from the solid
                    rock. This<lb/> vein of marble, which appeared to be from 15 to<lb/> 20 yards in
                    width, runs in the direction of south-<lb/>east, and north-west, through a
                    stratum of lime-<lb/>stone, a few feet below the surface of the ground;<lb/> and
                    it has the appearance of there having been<lb/> cleft in the limestone rock,
                    into which the mar-<lb/>ble had been poured in a liquid state. Col. H. at<lb/>
                    <pb n="273" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_273"/> whose house we were generously entertained, and<lb/> who is owner

                    from it in<lb/> one year, at 4s. 6d. per foot. The weather being<lb/> fine, and
                    our little party consisting of several<lb/> agreeable men and women friends, the
                    day was<lb/> spent very pleasantly. </p>

                <p>A. B. a friend from England,<lb/> paid me a visit, having some prospect of taking
                    a<lb/> farm in this neighbourhood. His predecessors<lb/> for several
                    generations, had lived upon a farm on<lb/> Delamere Forest in Cheshire; but the
                    steward to<lb/> the present proprietor, having turned him off the<lb/> farm, he,
                    with his widowed mother, and several<lb/> sisters and a brother, had lately come
                    over to<lb/> America, with the view of taking and managing a<lb/> cheese farm,
                    upon the Cheshire plan. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
                <dateline><date when="1806-08-23">8th Month, 23d</date>. <placeName key="checkPlace"
                    /></dateline>
                <p>I accompanied A. B. to<lb/> G. A.'s in order to have some conversation with<lb/>
                    him respecting a farm he had to let, and to view it.<lb/> This farm was in a
                    good state of cultivation, with<lb/> an excellent house, a very large barn, and
                    stabling<lb/> for many horses, with other conveniences on an<lb/> extensive
                    scale. The spring house, or dairy, in<lb/> particular struck my attention,
                    having a trench of<lb/> spring water, about 2 feet wide and 4 or 5 inches<lb/>
                    deep, running all round the room, paved at the<lb/> bottom, and inclosed at the
                    sides with slabs of<lb/> white marble. </p>
                <pb n="274" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_274"/>
                <p>I have before observed, that in the spring wa-<lb/> ter which surrounds the floor
                    of the dairies in this<lb/> country, are placed the vessels which contain
                    the<lb/> milk, &amp;c. and all is thus preserved sweet and cool,<lb/> in the
                    hottest part of the summer. Another<lb/> conveniency I noticed in this
                    farm-yard, was an<lb/> appendage to the hog-sty being a vault, near<lb/> which
                    was a stream of water, all within the inclo-<lb/> sure wherein the hogs were
                    confined. The advan-<lb/> tages and comfort thus resulting to these animals,
                    in<lb/> hot weather must be obvious. On this farm, was<lb/> also an excellent
                    orchard of several acres, the trees<lb/> of which were at this time in their
                    prime, and<lb/> now in full bearing, and having been planted by<lb/> the late
                        <persName key="tmiff1">Governor Mifflin</persName>, whose residence was<lb/>
                    here, they were well selected. Such abundance<lb/> of fine fruit I never before
                    beheld, in the same<lb/> compass of ground; two or three of the best trees<lb/>
                    were literally broken down with the weight of the<lb/> fruit. The rent G. A.
                    proposed for his farm,<lb/> with all these appendages, was about 20s. per<lb/>
                    acre; and, the quantity being short of 100 acres,<lb/> the rent would amount to
                    little more than legal<lb/> interest for the money which had been expanded<lb/>
                    in buildings. As it was not more than an hour's<lb/> ride from Philadelphia, and
                    the land of good qua-<lb/> lity, I thought the price very reasonable. </p>

                <p>My business requiring that<lb/> I should see a person who was at the <placeName
                        key="yello2">Yellow<lb/> Springs</placeName>, I this day took a ride
                    thither. At the<lb/> inn where I breakfasted, which was the General<lb/> Paoli
                    Tavern, I met with a family who had landed<lb/> a few days before in
                    Philadelphia, and were now<lb/> on their way to the Ohio. As they spoke
                    neither<lb/> English no French, I was unable to make out<lb/> from what part of
                    the continent of Europe they<lb/> came; but, from their dress, I supposed
                    from<lb/> Switzerland. The men wore a plain jacket and<lb/> trowsers, with very
                    large shallow crowned hats;<lb/> and the women had their hair plaited in long
                    braids,<lb/> which hung down their backs, with jackets and<lb/> petticoats just
                    the reverse of the fashions of the pre-<lb/> sent day. Altogether they had the
                    appearance of a<lb/> stout, hardy race, and, in this company, I understand<lb/>
                    there were four generations. The master of the<lb/> inn informed me that he had
                    reason to believe they<lb/> had a very large property with them, in the
                    wag-<lb/> gons in which they travelled. On my arrival at<lb/> the Yellow
                    Springs, I bathed and drank the waters,<lb/>
                    <pb n="276" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_276"/> which are I believe, a chalybeate. In the evening<lb/> I returned
                    to <placeName key="merio">Merion</placeName>, where I lodged, but was<lb/> kept
                    awake for a while in reflecting on the wide<lb/> wasting effects of war,
                    probably in consequence of<lb/> meeting with the family of strangers at the
                    Paoli<lb/> Tavern. That spot was rendered famous by the de-<lb/> struction, as
                    is said, of some hundred Americans,<lb/> who lay encamped there, and were
                    surprized in the<lb/> dead of the night by a detachment of the English<lb/>
                    army, and put to the sword. The consequence of<lb/> which was, I have been
                    informed, that a party of<lb/> English met with the same fate in a similar way,
                    from<lb/> the swords of the Americans, on the Banks of Hud-<lb/> son River. In
                    addition to that event, I understood,<lb/> from the master of the inn, that the
                    family of<lb/> strangers I had mentioned, all of whom appeared<lb/> to be
                    persons of respectability, had been compelled<lb/> to seek shelter in a foreign
                    land, to avoid the<lb/> scourge of the sword, which had recently over-<lb/>
                    whelmed their country. </p>
                <p>How little do the potentates of the world and<lb/> their ministers, calculate on
                    the miseries they pro-<lb/> duce. And ah! how little do they consider what<lb/>
                    responsibility, in the nature of things, they must<lb/> inevitably entail upon
                    themselves in a future state<lb/> of being. </p>

                    The wind<lb/> beginning to blow very strong, the Captain of the<lb/>

                    morning, being a distance of near 20<lb/> miles. As we were running before the

                    very rough sea, the vessel sud-<lb/> denly struck against something which
                    immediately<lb/> stopped her progress; and she swung round with<lb/> great

                <p>This morning I went out with<lb/> J. M. to attend upon a black man, who had
                    come<lb/> from New-York, to treat for the purchase of a<lb/> chaise which J. M.
                    wished to sell, having lately<lb/> purchased a new one upon a different
                    construction.<lb/> In conversation I gathered a little of the history<lb/> of
                    this black man, who by his industry and ma-<lb/> nagement, had acquired a
                    considerable freehold<lb/> property in houses in the city and could now,<lb/>
                    with propriety, indulge his family with the conve-<lb/> niency of a chaise. </p>
                <p>A few years past he was in very low circum-<lb/> stances, but coming under the
                    notice of <persName>J. M.</persName><lb/> who has been, I believe, amongst the
                    foremost in<lb/> befriending the poor blacks, he was put for-<lb/> ward and
                    assisted in business, and with so much<lb/> success, that he is now become a
                    very respectable<lb/> tradesman. Indeed he ranks much higher than many<lb/> of
                    those, who have so strenuously contended that<lb/> the poor blacks are little or
                    nothing removed from<lb/> the brute creation; and that they may be bought,<lb/>
                    sold, and degraded, as having neither the feelings<lb/> nor faculties of men. So
                    erroneous is this idea,<lb/>
                    <pb n="281" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_281"/> that I have met with slave merchants, who were<lb/> far inferior
                    to this black person, in the faculties<lb/> of the mind. </p>
                <p>After a pleasant morning thus spent at J. M.'s,<lb/> he brought me to <placeName
                        key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, and shewed me<lb/> through the cellars of
                    his extensive brewery in<lb/> that city. The remaining part of the day, was<lb/>
                    spent in preparations for my voyage to England. </p>

                <p>This morning I attended <orgName key="meetny">New-<lb/> York</orgName> meeting,
                    and afterwards dined at my cousin<lb/> B. B.'s; and drank tea and spent the

                <p>The afternoon meeting was disturbed this day,<lb/> by a singular character, who,
                    I understand, was<lb/> often very troublesome. After the meeting had<lb/> sat
                    some time in silence, he got up, and, with a<lb/> loud violent gesticulation,
                    declared that<lb/> he came there that day, in order to bear his solemn<lb/>
                    testimony against silent meetings. </p>

                <p>This day was mostly employed<lb/> in packing up my luggage, and putting it on

                <p>This morning, between six<lb/> and seven o'clock, I went on board the Oliver<lb/>
                    Elsworth, attended by several friends of New-York,<lb/> who kindly accompanied
                    us, and remained until<lb/> the ship weighed and or about eight o'clock. I<lb/>
                    <pb n="282" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_282"/> then took a final farewell of <q>this delightful<lb/> land,</q> in
                    which, although I have met with many<lb/> things to try my faith and patience, I
                    have<lb/> nevertheless met with kind-hearted, affectionate<lb/> friends; many of
                    whom feel nearer and dearer to<lb/> me than I have language to express; and
                    whose<lb/> kindness and hospitality, I trust, will never be<lb/> effaced from my
                    memory. </p>
                <p>Although a voyage to America may be consi-<lb/> dered as a laborious and perilous
                    undertaking, yet<lb/> have thought myself well repaid, in the pleasing<lb/>
                    event of many amiable and worthy friends having<lb/> thereby been added to the
                    list of my acquaintance;<lb/> whom, in all probability, I should otherwise
                    never<lb/> have known; and who, as to myself, would have<lb/> been as though
                    they had never been. </p>
                <p>As the loss of friends by death or otherwise,<lb/> may be considered as one of
                    the severest of priva-<lb/> tions to a sensible mind; so, on the other
                    hand,<lb/> any addition to the number may be truly consi-<lb/> dered as one of
                    the most valuable acquisitions.<lb/> Yet such are our various propensities, that
                    many,<lb/> no doubt, look upon the satisfaction arising from<lb/> sources of
                    this kind, as little better than the phan-<lb/> toms of the imagination: and not
                    to be compared<lb/> with the pleasures arriving from wealth or worldly<lb/>
                    honours. </p>
                <p>Having weighed anchor, and got all sails<lb/> spread, we glided gently along,
                    having but little<lb/>
                    <pb n="283" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_283"/> wind. The weather being fine and clear, we had<lb/> a beautiful
                    autumnal prospect of the country<lb/> around us, all the way down to <placeName
                        key="sandh">Sandyhook</placeName>; and<lb/> there being no sickness among
                    the passengers, we<lb/> enjoyed the scene. Our company consisted of a<lb/>
                    remarkable diversity as to the countries whence<lb/> they came. One came from
                    Delhi in Persia;<lb/> two were Hindoos, a man and woman; one came<lb/> from
                    Berbice in South America; one from Jamaica;<lb/> one from Ireland; one from
                    Scotland; four from<lb/> England; and one was a military officer from<lb/>
                    Bengal. Besides these, the Captain and Mate<lb/> of the ship were North
                    Americans, and the ship's<lb/> Steward was a native of Germany. </p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this great national variety, in<lb/> our cabin's company, and a
                    great diversity in reli-<lb/> gious profession, yet considerable harmony
                    pre-<lb/> vailed; which in a great measure arose from the<lb/> constitution of
                    our little republic, the government<lb/> of which was formed, at the request of
                    the Cap-<lb/> tain, in the outset of the voyage. The plan<lb/> adopted was to
                    divide the company in the cabin,<lb/> into three committees, who took the
                    government<lb/> into their hands by turns; each having the direction<lb/> of
                    affairs for a certain number of days in rotation;<lb/> during which the Steward
                    and Cook applied to the<lb/> acting committee for instructions, in all
                    affairs<lb/> relative to eating and drinking; these being mat-<lb/> ters in
                    which the judgment of passengers is very<lb/>
                    <pb n="284" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_284"/> likely to differ; especially when consisting of na-<lb/> tives of
                    so many different parts of the world. The<lb/> Captain foreseeing this, had
                    wisely proposed to us<lb/> this mode of arrangement, and thus removed all<lb/>
                    responsibility from himself, whilst it left him more<lb/> fully at liberty to
                    manage the ship. </p>
                <p>A little before we left <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, there
                    had<lb/> been some very boisterous weather, the effects<lb/> of which we had an
                    opportunity of noticing, as<lb/> we passed by <placeName key="sandh"
                        >Sandyhook</placeName>; where we saw several<lb/> vessels which had suffered
                    severely. One in par-<lb/> ticular had lost all her masts, and was
                    endeavour-<lb/> ing to make her way to <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName>, by means of a<lb/> little canvas spread upon some
                    temporary poles,<lb/> which they had set up. Another had her top-mast<lb/>
                    broken off, and still hanging by the rigging; how-<lb/> ever the weather was
                    then clear and calm, and for<lb/> several days no sickness appeared amongst
                    us.<lb/> For twelve days we made but very slow progress;<lb/> but on the
                    thirteenth day we got upon the <placeName key="bnewf">Banks<lb/> of
                        Newfoundland</placeName>, where the vessel was stopped<lb/> a few hours,
                    during which we took some fish;<lb/> after which we hoisted our sails and
                    cleared the<lb/> Banks early the next day. </p>
                <p>A little before we reached the Banks, the wea-<lb/> ther being very fine and
                    calm, we discovered a sail<lb/> to the eastward, which like ourselves, made
                    but<lb/> very little progress; yet, in the course of the fore-<lb/>
                    <pb n="285" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_285"/>noon, we came within five or six miles of each<lb/> other, when the
                    wind nearly died away, and the<lb/> sea became as smooth as a fish-pond. As the
                    ship<lb/> in sight was deemed likely to be coming from<lb/> England, some of our
                    people had a great desire to<lb/> get along-side of her, in order to inquire
                    what news<lb/> she brought. The boat was in consequence let<lb/> down into the
                    sea, and the mate and several pas-<lb/> sengers got in and rowed away, until
                    they had an<lb/> opportunity of getting on board; when they found<lb/> that she
                    was a ship bound to Philadelphia from<lb/> Rotterdam. </p>
                <p>After leaving this vessel, a young man from<lb/> Manchester having a desire to
                    bathe in the sea,<lb/> all being smooth and calm, stripped himself for<lb/> that
                    purpose. The Captain of the Philadelphia<lb/> ship observing this, took his
                    speaking trumpet,<lb/> and warned him against going into the sea; as they<lb/>
                    had observed a large shark hovering about them<lb/> all the morning; but the
                    young man supposing he<lb/> was only in jest, paid no regard to him, and
                    leaped<lb/> into the sea, where he swam about a little time,<lb/> and then got
                    safely into the boat again. How-<lb/> ever, on the boat's approaching our
                    vessel, the<lb/> shark was discovered in company with her, watch-<lb/> ing for
                    his prey, and continued hovering round<lb/> our ship for some time. Looking at
                    all the cir-<lb/> cumstances of the case, it may be considered a<lb/> singular
                    and wonderful preservation, that this<lb/>
                    <pb n="286" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_286"/> young man was not devoured; for had he con-<lb/> tinued one minute
                    longer in the water, in all pro-<lb/> bability he would have been destroyed. By
                    this<lb/> little excursion of the boat I saw the extreme<lb/> folly and danger
                    of leaving a ship at sea, even in<lb/> the finest weather; except in cases of
                    absolute<lb/> necessity; for this boat had not got above half<lb/> way to the
                    other ship, when a squall came on with<lb/> a thick haze, by which we lost sight
                    of them, and<lb/> they of us. Had this state of the weather con-<lb/> tinued but
                    for a few hours, they, in all likelihood,<lb/> would have been lost. When this
                    alteration in the<lb/> weather took place, and the boat disappeared, I<lb/>
                    confess I was extremely alarmed; although, on the<lb/> company's leaving the
                    ship, I gave one of them a<lb/> small pocket compass, fearing that by some
                    acci<lb/> -dent, they might be separated from us. On my<lb/> expressing my fears
                    to the Captain, he said that<lb/> he scarcely knew a boat leave the ship in a
                    calm<lb/> like this, but a squall of wind came on. </p>

                <p>On the 14th day of our voyage, being the <date when="1806-09-23">23d of<lb/> the
                        9th month</date>, after taking soundings on the <placeName key="bnewf"
                        >Banks</placeName>,<lb/> the wind freshened, and being in our favour,
                    we<lb/> sailed about 220 miles, and on the 15th day, the<lb/> wind still
                    increasing, we sailed about 230 miles in<lb/> our direct course. On the evening,
                    between seven<lb/> and eight o'clock, we descried a ship going right<lb/> before
                    the wind, like ourselves, with all sails set;<lb/> and by ten o'clock, being
                    about two hours and a<lb/>
                    <pb n="287" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_287"/> half, we came up with her, and passing close by,<lb/> we found her
                    to be the British Packet from<lb/> Halifax. In passing, we observed the men
                    were<lb/> all at their guns, with lighted matches, supposing<lb/> our ship was
                    an enemy in pursuit of them. We<lb/> soon lot sight of them, our vessel being

                <p>On the <date when="1806-09-25">16th day</date> we sailed near 220 miles, and<lb/>
                    on the 17th day about 140 miles; on the 18th<lb/> about 220 miles; on the 19th
                    about 120 miles;<lb/> and on the 20th day about 240 miles. Sailing in<lb/> this
                    rapid manner, the motion of the ship through<lb/> the waves caused a foam as
                    white as milk; a long<lb/> train of which might be seen to a great distance<lb/>
                    behind the vessel; and the hissing noise the ship<lb/> produced, excited the
                    idea of a huge mass of red<lb/> hot iron, passing through the water. On the
                    21st<lb/> day of our voyage, we sailed about 120 miles; on<lb/> the 22d day
                    about 120, and on the 23d about 250;<lb/> and this day we made soundings off
                    Cape Clear.<lb/> Thus, from the 14th to the 23d, being the space<lb/> of 9 days,
                    we sailed from soundings to soundings<lb/> on the two sides of the Atlantic
                    Ocean; a very<lb/> short space of time, to traverse so vast a sea.<lb/> On the
                    24th day we entered <geogName key="chann">the Channel</geogName>, and<lb/> early
                    in the morning passed in sight of Waterford<lb/> Light-house. In the course of

                    having sailed nearly 120<lb/> miles. </p>

                <p>On the <date when="1806-10-04">25th day,</date> about midnight, we came<lb/>
                    close in with the point of <placeName key="holyhead">Holyhead</placeName>; and,
                    about<lb/> one in the morning, came in sight of the Skerries<lb/> Light-house.
                    This was the last night we were out<lb/> at sea, and to me it appeared by far
                    the most<lb/> dangerous; for the wind being very high, and the<lb/> tide running
                    very strong along this rocky coast,<lb/> made so much noise, that the seamen
                    were unable<lb/> to hear the captain give his commands; and being<lb/> close in
                    with the Isle of Anglesea, we appeared to<lb/> be completely land-locked. </p>
                <p>I stood by the captain, he requested me to<lb/> reach the speaking trumpet, which
                    was the only<lb/> time he had occasion to make use of it for this<lb/> purpose
                    during the voyage. All was agitation<lb/> and bustle for a time; the loud
                    roaring of the<lb/> winds and waves was such, that, even aided by<lb/> the
                    speaking trumpet, it was with difficulty the<lb/> Captain could make himself
                    heard by the poor<lb/> seamen, who were aloft in the rigging, using every<lb/>
                    exertion to keep the ship from driving upon the<lb/> rocks; with the wind
                    blowing right upon them. </p>
                <p>I had now crossed the Atlantic four times, but<lb/> had not before heard so loud
                    an uproar of winds<lb/> and waves as at this period; which, I suppose, was<lb/>
                    in part owing to the tide at this time running out<lb/> with violence round the
                    point of <placeName key="holyh">Holyhead</placeName>, and<lb/> adding to the
                    loud howling of the winds in the<lb/>
                    <pb n="289" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_289"/> neighboring mountains, which then appeared<lb/> nearly to surround
                    us. These were to me the<lb/> most awful moments I had experienced, in all
                    my<lb/> travels, and, by those who know any thing of the<lb/> coast, our
                    situation may be more easily conceived<lb/> than I can describe it. As the ship
                    was thus with<lb/> difficulty working her way through the discordant<lb/>
                    elements, every moment in danger of striking upon<lb/> the rocks, we happily
                    came in sight of the <placeName key="skerr">Skerries<lb/> Lights</placeName>,
                    which removed all our fears. To be re-<lb/> lieved from a situation of such
                    great anxiety and<lb/> danger, was indeed cause of thankfulness, and I<lb/>
                    trust will not soon be forgotten. </p>
                <p>Although there were neither moon nor stars<lb/> visible, yet the bleak mountains
                    around us were<lb/> distinctly seen, and at times did not appear to be<lb/> more
                    than a stone's cast from the ship; but this<lb/> appearance was in all
                    probability deceptive, as it<lb/> was scarcely possible we could have escaped
                    ship-<lb/> wreck, had we really been so near the rocks. </p>
                <p>Immediately after coming in sight of the Lights,<lb/> a signal gun was fired from
                    our ship; and in a few<lb/> minutes a pilot-boat came alongside us, and we<lb/>
                    took a Pilot on board. The wind about this time<lb/> subsiding we gently made
                    our way up <geogName key="chann">the Channel</geogName>;<lb/> and early in the
                    morning, cast anchor off the<lb/> Cheshire coast, where we remained till
                    day-light<lb/> of the 26th day of our voyage, being the <date when="1806-10-05"
                        >5th of the<lb/><pb n="290" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_290"/> 10th Month </date>. On arising and going upon
                    deck,<lb/> I found we were surrounded by a fleet of near 20<lb/> sail of ships,
                    several of them, like ourselves, being<lb/> from America, and all waiting the
                    return of the<lb/> tide. </p>
                <p>The morning being warm and fine, after so<lb/> tempestuous a night, we enjoyed
                    the prospect<lb/> around us; and, about eleven o'clock, we and the<lb/> rest of
                    the vessels in company, weighed anchor.<lb/> Having but little wind, most of our
                    sails were<lb/> spread to it, and we gently made our way to the<lb/> Mersey. In
                    this interval, our cabin company all<lb/> sat down to dinner together.
                    Notwithstanding<lb/> we were so diversified, both with respect to<lb/> country
                    and to habits, and manners; yet, having<lb/> been so closely confined within the
                    narrow limits<lb/> of the ship; daily eating and drinking together,<lb/> and
                    being sharers in every danger, an attachment<lb/> was produced, so that I could
                    not avoid feeling a<lb/> sensation of seriousness in the reflection, that
                    this<lb/> was, in all likelihood, the last time we should meet<lb/> together
                    again in this world. </p>
                <p>I have sometimes thought it a little remarkable,<lb/> that of all the variety of
                    the people we had on board,<lb/> if I except a near relation, I received more
                    kind-<lb/>ness and attention from the poor Hindoo man,<lb/> though he was in the
                    station of a servant, than<lb/> from any other person. Although he did not<lb/>
                    <pb n="291" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_291"/> bear the name of a Christian, yet in Christian<lb/> virtues he far
                    excelled many who bear the<lb/> name; and I sometimes was ready to wish I<lb/>
                    could have entered into his thoughts when he<lb/> heard, as was sometimes the
                    case, some of our<lb/> Christian passengers, advocating the justice and<lb/>
                    propriety of Negro slavery. He himself was of a<lb/> darker hue than than many
                    slaves. </p>
                <p>On my leaving the ship, there were divers<lb/> articles which it was not
                    necessary should pass the<lb/> Custom-house; and which I wished to take
                    with<lb/> me to my relation's in <placeName key="liver">Liverpool</placeName>.
                    On getting<lb/> these matters together, and being about to have<lb/> them taken
                    away, with the permission of the officer<lb/> on board, I was surprised at this
                    kind Hindoo<lb/> stepping forward, and insisting upon taking them<lb/> to my
                    quarters in the town, where he delivered<lb/> them safely at the house of my
                    relation, a distance<lb/> of more than a mile from the ship, without
                    accept-<lb/> ing any other reward, than the satisfaction of<lb/> doing a kind
                    office to one he believed to be his<lb/> friend. The articles he took, were
                    mostly natural<lb/> curiosities, with some specimens of Indian inge-<lb/> nuity;
                    and I was entertained, with the interest which<lb/> seemed to be excited in the
                    people who stood<lb/> gazing at this friendly Indian, as he traversed the<lb/>
                    streets with his burden; both himself and his load<lb/> being equally objects of
                    attention to the curious. </p>
                <pb n="292" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_292"/>
                <p>It is ever a matter of deep regret to see men,<lb/> who profess to be believers
                    in the Gospel of<lb/> Christ; and who have had the privilege of read-<lb/> ing
                    it, and judging of its excellence, debasing<lb/> themselves by the practice of
                    every mean and<lb/> sordid vice, allowed by the selfish policy of the<lb/>
                    world: on the other hand, it is exceedingly pleas-<lb/> ing to behold those,
                    whom, because they have not<lb/> had the same privileges, we are ready to
                    designate<lb/> by the names of Heathens and Infidels; but who,<lb/> by regarding
                    the law in themselves, become exam-<lb/>ples of many excellent Christian
                    virtues: Thus<lb/> manifesting that God is no respecter of persons. </p>
                <p>Being favoured once more to set foot on my<lb/> native land, for which I have
                    great cause to be<lb/> thankful, J. W. and myself walked up to my<lb/>
                    relation's at <placeName key="milee">Mile-end</placeName>, where we met with
                    a<lb/> hospitable and affectionate reception. </p>
                <p>After spending this night and the fore part of<lb/> the following day with them,
                    we set out in the<lb/> long coach for <placeName key="manch"
                        >Manchester</placeName>. In observing the<lb/> extreme oppression exercised
                    upon the poor horses,<lb/> in these heavy carriages, I found a great draw-<lb/>
                    back from the pleasure which otherwise would<lb/> have been derived from
                    travelling by land. </p>
                <p>We got safe to Manchester the same evening,<lb/> where we lodged; and early the
                    next morning, we<lb/>
                    <pb n="293" facs="SW_Sutcliff_Page_293"/> again took coach, and set off for <placeName key="sheff"
                        >Sheffield</placeName>, where<lb/> we were favoured to arrive safe and well
                    in the<lb/> evening; and I had the heartfelt satisfaction of<lb/> once more
                    joining my family and friends, after an<lb/> absence of more than two years. </p>
                <p>In this period I had travelled upwards of ten<lb/> thousand miles, without
                    meeting with any unplea-<lb/> sant accident. When I consider that in this<lb/>
                    space I twice crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and<lb/> that sometimes my way lay
                    through the uncleared<lb/> forests of America, where I often met with va-<lb/>
                    rious tribes of what are called Savage Indians, I<lb/> want language to express
                    the feelings of gratitude<lb/> which often arise in my breast, for my
                    numerous<lb/> preservations and unmerited favours. </p>
                <p>Finis. </p>
