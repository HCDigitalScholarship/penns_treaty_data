                <p>The minutes of the Indian Committee of Baltimore Yearly Meeting are housed at

                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of these minutes, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
                <p>The authors of the original book of minutes do include page numbers on this
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been rendered as written, even in some cases
                    when they are not sequential.</p>

                <opener>At a yearly Meeting held in <placeName key="balti1"
                    >Baltimore</placeName><lb/>for the Western Shore of Maryland and

                <p>A weighty concern being opened in this<lb/>Meeting respecting the difficulties
                    and distress to which<lb/>the Indian Natives of this land are subject—it
                    obtained the<lb/>serious attention of Friends, and many observations ware
                    made<lb/>on the kindness of their ancestors to ours in the early<lb/>settlement
                    of this Country—exciting to a deep consideration<lb/>and enquiry whether, under
                    the influence of that exalted<lb/>benevolence and good will to men which our
                    holy Prof-<lb/>ession requires; any thing, remained for us as a Society<lb/>to
                    do, to promote their Welfare, Religious Instruction,<lb/>Knowledge of
                    Agriculture and useful Mechanic Arts,<lb/>a solemnity and uniting Calm
                    prevailing over the Meeting<lb/>the further consideration of it is refered till
                    tomorrow.</p>
                <p>The Subject of the distressed Indian natives being<lb/>again revived, the
                    sentiments of many Brethren expressed,<lb/>and a prevailing Sympathy felt, it
                    appears to be the<lb/>united sense of this Meeting that it be recommended
                    to<lb/>our quarterly and Monthly Meetings to take this<lb/>concern into serious
                    consideration and open subscriptions<lb/>among our Members for their relief. The
                    encouragement<lb/>of School Education Husbandry and the Mechanic<pb n="2"

                            them by Traders and Evil-minded men<lb/>who have been in the practice of
                            taking advan-<lb/>tage of this weekness and cheating them of
                            their<lb/>Skins and Furs, which instead of being applied to<lb/>the
                            purchase of Cloathing and necessary articles<lb/>are too generally
                            bartered for Rum and Whiskey<lb/>and thus through their attachment to

                            left<lb/>destitute and miserable, their morals corrupted and<lb/>as they
                            come to reflect with coolness their minds are<pb n="7" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_009"/><lb/>embittered

                            desiring they would<lb/>devise means for restraining or prohibiting the
                            iniquitous<lb/>Traffic. The plea offered by some attempted on the part
                            of<lb/>the United States it would avail but little in remedy-<lb/>ing
                            the evil while the British Traders from Canada<lb/><gap/> deal so
                            largely with the Indians in this article.<lb/>We nevertheless hope that

                        <p>Brethren Quakers<lb/>You remember that we once<lb/>met at a certain
                            place; when we had met at that certa-<lb/>in place a great many good
                            things were said, and<lb/>much friendship was professed between us,
                            Brethren—<lb/>you told us at that time when we met together:
                            That<lb/>you not only took us by the hand, but that you<lb/>held us fast

                            you said it was not a<lb/>Chain of Iron, but that is was a chain
                            of<lb/>precious Metal, a chain of silver, which would<lb/>bind us in
                            brotherly affection forever,</p>
                        <p>Brethren; you then said, That this Chain<lb/>of Friendship would bind us

                            confirmed in the opinion from furnishing<lb/>them with this distructive
                            article in exchange<lb/>for their skins &amp; furs they will not easily
                            be<lb/>persuaded to turn their minds towards agriculture<lb/>and the

                            you were then told it<lb/>was a chain of precious metal, a chain

                            in brotherly affection forever</p>
                        <p>Brothers We were glad to hear, that you still<lb/>keep in remembrance
                            this agreement between your<lb/>grand fathers &amp; ours when they first

                            Quakers con-<lb/>sider all mankind as their brethren; that<lb/>they
                            believe the Great Spirit and Father<lb/>of Mankind created all men of
                            one blood;<lb/>and that it is the will of Him who also<lb/>created the
                            Sun, the Moon and the Stars,<lb/>and causes them to give us
                            light—that<lb/>Great Spirit and common Father of all<lb/>Mankind—that we
                            should not do one<lb/>another hurt, but that we should do
                            one<lb/>another all the good we can; and it is<lb/>on this ground and
                            this principle that<lb/>we believe it tight to take you by
                            the<lb/>hand.</p>
                        <p>After sitting a short time in silence,<lb/>another Friend addressed them
                            as fol-<lb/>lows:--</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>We the people called Quakers believe<lb/>that
                            it is required of us, that we should<lb/>all love one another, however
                            separated<lb/>we may be in our local settlements in the<lb/>world, or
                            whatever difference there may<lb/>be in our color: And as we are
                            convinc-<lb/>ed it is not in our power to perform our<lb/>religious
                            duties to Him that hath created<lb/>us, without his assistance, so we
                            conceive<lb/>it to be our duty, when we are about to<lb/>enter upon such
                            weighty business as I ap-<lb/>prehend this is, thus to sit down in
                            stillness,<lb/>in order to endeavor to feel after the operation<lb/>of
                            his spirit in our hearts, and we believe<lb/>that this cannot be
                            attained by our own<lb/>natural powers, but must be under the
                            in-<lb/>fluence of the Good Spirit. We also be-<lb/>lieve that there is
                            an evil spirit, which is al-<lb/>ways striving to lead us into wrong
                            things:<lb/>that Spirit which leads us to hate and de-<lb/>story one
                            another: and in this persuasion<lb/>of mind, we believe it necessary for
                            us<lb/>to sit down in stillness and quiet, to<lb/>wait upon the Great
                            Spirit. Under these<lb/>impressions we are concerned often to
                            as-<lb/>semble ourselves together, that we may<lb/>individually come
                            under an exercise and<lb/>concern, to be rightly directed inour
                            re-<lb/>ogious movements; and once in the year<lb/>we assemble at
                            certain places, in order to<lb/>have a general and full conference,
                            to<lb/>know how things are amongst us as a<lb/>people. One of these
                            meetings is held<lb/>at <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>
                            and another at <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>.<lb/>At our
                                <orgName key="bym">yearly meeting</orgName> at Baltimore
                            se-<lb/>veral years past, our minds were brought<lb/>under a concern on
                            behalf of our bre-<lb/>thren the Indians; and remembering
                            the<lb/>friendship that had subsisted between our<lb/>society and the
                            Indians, from the first<lb/>settlement of our fathers upon this
                            con-<lb/>tinent, and at the same time recollecting<lb/>that the country
                            to the westward was<lb/>fast settling, apprehensions arose in
                            our<lb/>mind, that as the game became scarce,<lb/>they would be brought
                            under sufferings,<lb/>and as there had been long wars between<lb/>some
                            of the white people and the Indi-<lb/>ans, we had not had, for a long
                            time,<lb/>an opportunity of taking our brothers,<lb/>the Indians, by the
                            hand. Now, bro-<lb/>thers, as we were thus led by the con-<lb/>cern that
                            arose in our council, some of<lb/>us were appointed to go out into
                            the<lb/>wilderness, and endeavor to get amongst<lb/>our brethren the
                            Indians, that we might<lb/>have some talk with them; and
                            amongst<lb/>those who were appointed, this my bro-<lb/>ther, who sits at
                            my right hand, was<lb/>one: and I have thought that he per-<lb/>haps can
                            give a more full account both<lb/>of the time, and of our first
                            movements<lb/>at the concern.</p>
                        <p>The Friend alluded to then proceed-<lb/>ed:--</p>
                        <p>Brothers,<lb/>About six years ago, we believe the<lb/>Good Spirit put
                            into our hearts, at our<lb/>great council held in this town, to
                            endea-<lb/>vor to do something for the Indians; and<lb/>about four years
                            ago, two others, besides<lb/>myself, went over the Great
                            Mountains<lb/>westward, in order to see your situation,<lb/>and to know
                            your disposition, whether you<lb/>would receive any thing from us or
                            not.<lb/>We wished to go to <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>,
                            expecting<lb/>to find the greatest number of Indians at<lb/>that place.
                            We could not get a guide till<lb/>we got to the forks of Scioto, where
                            we<lb/>agreed with one to take us to <persName key="izane1"/>Isaac
                            Zane’s.<lb/>--At that place we were informed that<lb/>a number of chiefs
                            were at <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>.—<lb/>We sent for
                            some <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> chiefs who re-<lb/>sided
                            about 25 miles from <persName key="izane1">Isaac
                            Zane’s</persName>,<lb/>and had a conference with them. We in-<lb/>formed
                            them of the desire our society had<lb/>to do something for the Indians
                            that would<lb/>be useful to them. From thence we went<lb/>to <placeName
                                key="sandu">Upper Sandusky</placeName>—<persName key="izane1">Isaac
                                Zane</persName> piloted<lb/>us, and there also had a conference
                            with<lb/>some of the <orgName key="delaware">Delaware chiefs</orgName>.
                            We want-<lb/>ed to know whether they would be wil-<lb/>ling to be
                            instructed on their own lands<lb/>in a way to procure a sufficiency for
                            them<lb/>to eat; to have a mill to grind their corn’<lb/>and have their
                            children instructed to read<lb/>and write. They informed us that
                            they<lb/>could not give us an answer at that time,<lb/>but would lay our
                            proposals before their<lb/>council.</p>
                        <p>About three years ago we received a<lb/>speech and a belt of Wampum from
                            a<lb/>council held at <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>; the
                            speech did<lb/>not contain an answer to the proposals<lb/>made to them,
                            but an invitation to us to<lb/>attend their council.—[A short
                            pause:]<lb/>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle,</persName> chief
                            of the <orgName key="miami">Miamis</orgName>,<lb/>said,</p>
                        <p>“Brother,<lb/>It is not usual for us to interrupt any<lb/>One in
                            speaking, but I wish to enquire<lb/>from whom the speech you mention
                            came."<lb/>The speech was then produced, and the<lb/>names to it read.
                                –-<persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle,</persName> adds,</p>
                        <p>I see that our brothers, the Quakers,<lb/>are not so fully acquainted
                            with the situ-<lb/>ation of the Indians as we wish. After<lb/>we have
                            taken the great chief of the<lb/>white people by the hand, I hope he
                            will<lb/>give you full information with respect to<lb/>us.<lb/>The
                            friend who had been interrupted, then<lb/>proceeded: <lb/><gap/></p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_050"/>
                        <p>Two years, last spring, seven of us went<lb/>over the <placeName
                                key="ohior">Ohio</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="sandu"
                                >Upper San-<lb/>dusky</placeName>, at the time mentioned in the
                            speech<lb/>that was sent to us—We were invited to<lb/>be there about the
                            first of June, and ac-<lb/>cordingly got there about that
                            time—but<lb/>were informed that the council was not to<lb/>be held till
                            about two weeks after. Not<lb/>being accustomed to their mode of
                            living,<lb/>and finding a considerable number of the<lb/>Indians at that
                            place intoxicated with li-<lb/>quor, we were much discouraged,
                            and<lb/>concluded we might as well return home<lb/>again. The Indians
                            however, notwith-<lb/>standing their situation, treated us
                            very<lb/>kindly. –We got together several chiefs of<lb/>the <orgName
                                key="wyandot">Wyandots</orgName>, and communicated to them<lb/>our
                            business—They informed us they<lb/>would lay it before the chiefs at the
                            coun-<lb/>cil and return us an answer; but we have<lb/>not yet received
                            one.</p>
                        <p>The friend who made the second commu-<lb/>nication, addressed them again
                            as fol-<lb/>lows:</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>We were glad when we heard that sone<lb/>of our
                            red brethren were come to this city,<lb/>and felt our minds drawn to
                            take them by<lb/>the hand, in order that we might have
                            an<lb/>opportunity of knowing them. As we<lb/>had not been acquainted
                            with their situa-<lb/>tions and circumstances, we have not<lb/>been able
                            to judge whether any thing we<lb/>had to propose to do for them would
                            be<lb/>accepted? –Whether they were under the<lb/>necessity of applying
                            to some other mode<lb/>for a livelihood? –Whether the game in<lb/>their
                            country was in plenty? We have<lb/>thought, brothers, that if it should
                            not yet<lb/>be the case that the game is scarce, it pro-<lb/>bably will
                            be the case at some time; and<lb/>therefore we thought it would be best
                            for<lb/>our red brethren to gibe some attention to<lb/> the cultivation
                            of the soil. This is one of the<lb/>subjects which has claimed our
                            considerati-<lb/>on. And feeling in our hearts that we loved<lb/>the
                            Indians, and wished their welfare, it was<lb/>our concern that they
                            might be instructed<lb/>to turn their attention to the
                            cultivation<lb/>of their lands. And as we believe, broth-<lb/>ers, that
                            we derive very great advantages<lb/>from reading books which contain
                            much<lb/>instruction, &amp; wishing that our brethren, the<lb/>Indians,
                            should also derive the same advan-<lb/>tages with us, we have wished
                            that they<lb/>should candidly let us know, whether they<lb/>desire these
                            things, that we might do for<lb/>them whatever is in my power to do.</p>
                        <p>After a pause, the <persName key="lturt">Little Turtle</persName>
                            observed,<lb/>“Brothers and Friends,<lb/>If there is any thing more that
                            you have’=<lb/>to say we wish to hear it; but if not I will<lb/>make a
                            short reply to what we have already<lb/>heard you say." He was desired
                            to pro-<lb/>ceed; when rising on his feet he said—</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>My heart returns thanks to the Great<lb/>Spirit
                            above, that has put it in our power<lb/>to speak to each other. My
                            brother<lb/>chiefs, with myself, are glad that our<lb/>friends and
                            brothers the Quakers, have<lb/>such great compassion for their red
                            bre-<lb/>thren.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>Your red brethren believe, that one
                            man<lb/>--one Great Man—made all the men that<lb/>are on the earth; and
                            that he made men<lb/>when he made the earth, and that he made<lb/>the
                            sun, the moon and the stars to give<lb/>light and to be useful to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>We now rejoice that the Great Spirit
                            has<lb/>made you feel that we stand in need of<lb/>the assistance which
                            you have been describe-<lb/>ing to us, and to wish if possible to
                            render<lb/>your red brethren those services which<lb/>they now are
                            highly in need of.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>It appears to us, your red brethren,
                            that<lb/>you have been kept in the straight path by<lb/>the Great and
                            Good Spirit. We have been<lb/>led astray by inferior spirits: we now
                            hope<lb/>that we may come upon your track and<lb/>follow it.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>The long and destructive wars that<lb/>have
                            raged in the country of your red<lb/>brethren, since your fathers first
                            camea-<lb/>mongst them, have caused their numbers<lb/>to be greatly
                            diminished. Those that have<lb/>come amongst us have very much
                            cheated<lb/>and imposed upon us. They have found us<lb/>simple and
                            ignorant, and have taken very<lb/>great care to keep every thing from
                            our<lb/>knowledge in order to profit by our ignor-<lb/>ance.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>We find that you are now disposed with<lb/>open
                            arms to receive us, and we hope the<lb/>Great Spirit will assist you,
                            together with the<lb/>great chief of the white people, whom we<lb/>are
                            now about to apply to for help.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>At the treaty of Grenville, which is now<lb/>a
                            little past six years ago, we received some<lb/>presents by the hands of
                            the great war chief<lb/>of the Americans—<persName key="gwayn1">(gen.
                                Wayne)</persName> said<lb/>to be sent to us by our brothers the
                            Qua-<lb/>kers. After this treaty, I was invited by<lb/>the great chiefs
                            of the Americans to<lb/>visit them. It is now four years since<lb/>I
                            visited them at <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, whilst
                            the<lb/>great council was held at that city. I had<lb/>there opportunity
                            to see our brothers the<lb/>Quakers, and received from their
                            mouths<lb/>some talks: all these talks I wrapped up<lb/>in my heart, and
                            when I returned home<lb/>to my brothers, I communicated to
                            them<lb/>faithfully all those good things which you<lb/>had told us you
                            were desirous to do for us.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>I am happy to say that these my
                            red<lb/>brothers now present with me are chiefs,<lb/>who, in their own
                            country are equally great<lb/>with myself. They were rejoiced to
                            hear<lb/>your words delivered to them through me,<lb/>four years ago,
                            and they are now equally<lb/>glad with myself, to hear from the
                            mouths<lb/>of our brothers, the Quakers, the same<lb/>good words
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>If we understand you right, you wish to<lb/>add
                            comfort to our women and children by<lb/>teaching us some of your ways
                            of living. I<lb/>am glad that the Great Spirit has put this<lb/>into
                            your hearts, and am sorry that your<lb/>exertions have not yet been
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I now assure you, that you hear the<lb/>voice
                            of the <orgName key="potaw">Pattawattamy</orgName>, <orgName key="miami"

                            tribes<lb/>of Indians, and that if you wish to do any<lb/>thing for any
                            of these nations of Indians,<lb/>they will be ready at all times to
                            receive<lb/>you—and we also will be ready at all times<lb/>to render you
                            any assistance in our power.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>This is the first time that the Great
                            Spi-<lb/>rit has brought us to take our brothers,<lb/>the Quakers of
                                <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, by the hand,<lb/>and
                            we rejoice to hear them mention the<lb/>same things to us, that have
                            heretofore<lb/>been mentioned to us by our brothers, the<lb/>Quakers of
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. Brothers, I
                            some<lb/>time past received from our brothers, the<lb/>Quakers of
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, some tools
                            amongst<lb/>which were two ploughs. I used them, &amp; did<lb/>all I
                            could to keep them from wearing out<lb/>--I was pleased with them: They
                            have<lb/>now become necessary to be repaired. We<lb/>have nobody amongst
                            us that can mend<lb/>them and they are now useless to me.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>It is now five days since we took
                            our<lb/>brothers, the Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName> by<lb/>the hand—we then talked over these
                            things<lb/>together. They have promised me that at<lb/>their next great
                            council, they will hold a<lb/>talk about these things, and consider
                            what<lb/>they can do for us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>If our brothers, the Quakers of <placeName
                                key="balti1">Balti-<lb/>more</placeName>, desire to do any thing for
                            the In-<lb/>dians, I wish to give them full information<lb/>of the place
                            where we may be found gene-<lb/>rally together. The great council of
                            our<lb/>tribes of Indians, is held at <placeName key="fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne</placeName><lb/>at the time we receive our annuity from<pb
                                    n="49" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_051"/><lb/>the United States. At that time any
                            com-<lb/>munications our Brothers wish to make to<lb/>their red
                            brethren, will be safely handed to<lb/>us by your white brother, our
                            interpreter<lb/>now with us, who is our agent at that<lb/>place.</p>
                        <p>He then sits down—after a short pause<lb/>rises again,</p>
                        <p>Brothers,<lb/>I must add a few words further: I find<lb/>that I have not
                            fully answered all the<lb/>questions that our brothers have put to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>It is the real wish of your brothers
                            the<lb/>Indians, to engage in the cultivation of our<lb/>lands—And
                            although the game is not yet<lb/>so scarce, but that we can get enough
                            to<lb/>eat, we know it is becoming scarce, and<lb/>that we must begin to
                            take hold of such<lb/>tools as we see are in the hands of the<lb/>white
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>We are now on our way to see the
                            great<lb/>chiefs of the Americans at their council.<lb/>We are glad to
                            find that they remember<lb/>their red brethren, and rejoice to
                            believe<lb/>that the Great Spirit has put it into the<lb/>heart of the
                            great chief of the white peo-<lb/>ple to do us such services as will add
                            to the<lb/>comfort of his red children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I will now only add, that I rejoice
                            to<lb/>believe that your friendship to your red<lb/>brethren is a
                            friendship that is pure—a<lb/>friendship that comes from the
                            heart—You<lb/>want no compensation from the Indians<lb/>for your
                            services to them. You do not<lb/>want to take away our lands from
                            us—<lb/>you have always made use of this language<lb/>to us; and it has
                            always been with plea-<lb/>sure that I have communicated it to
                            our<lb/>brethren. Brothers, we are a jealously<lb/>disposed
                            people—almost every white man<lb/>that comes amongst us, endeavors all
                            he<lb/>can to cheat us; this has occasioned jeal-<lb/>ousy among us. But
                            your talks, brothers,<lb/>are different; we believe you, when
                            you<lb/>say you want no compensation from us,<lb/>for your services to
                            your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Sits down.</p>
                        <p><persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals,</persName> chief of the <orgName
                                key="potaw">Pattawattamies</orgName>,<lb/>rises:</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>I rejoice to hear that you have so
                            much<lb/>compassion on your red brethren. As my<lb/>friend the <persName
                                key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> has observed, it is<lb/>not
                            the first time that we have received to-<lb/>kens of friendship from
                            you. It is some<lb/>years since the treaty of Grenville, where<lb/>we
                            first experienced the friendship of our<lb/>brothers, the Quakers. Some
                            time after<lb/>the treaty, my friend the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                Turtle</persName><lb/>visited the great council of the white
                            peo-<lb/>ple held at <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>; he
                            there saw our<lb/>friends and brothers, the Quakers—He<lb/>was there
                            informed of their good wishes,<lb/>and of the great friendship they had
                            for<lb/>their red brethren. He returned home<lb/>and informed of all the
                            great talks he had<lb/>with our brothers, the Quakers, of <placeName
                                key="phila">Phila-<lb/>delphia.</placeName></p>
                        <p>It is truly pleasing to me, Brothers, to<lb/>hear the same talks my
                            friend had inform-<lb/>ed me of, now repeated on my arrival
                                at<lb/><placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> by our friends
                            and brothers the<lb/>Quakers.</p>
                        <p>I hope, Brothers, that the Great Spi-<lb/>Rit, who has the disposal of
                            men will assist<lb/>you in your laudable undertakings, and<lb/>enable
                            you to be of service to your red<lb/>Brethren.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>The talks that you have now delivered<lb/>to us
                            shall be carefully collected, wrapped<lb/>up, and put in our hearts—we
                            will not for-<lb/>get them. On our return home we will<lb/>have them
                            communicated from the head to<lb/>the mouth of the <placeName
                                key="wabasu">Wabasu</placeName>—from this to<lb/>the <placeName
                                key="missi">Missisippi</placeName>, and up that river until
                            it<lb/>strikes the Lakes, thence round by <placeName key="michi"
                                >Michil-<lb/>limackanack</placeName> until they come back
                            again<lb/>to the same place. What we say to you,<lb/>you may be assured
                            does not come from one<lb/>man—it comes from many—and what you<lb/>have
                            said to us, you speak it to but a<lb/>few, but it shall be communicated
                            to many.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I observed to our friends the Quakers<lb/>of
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, five days ago, what
                            I<lb/>now say to you—That we wish our bro-<lb/>thers, the Quakers, to
                            render us those<lb/>services which they have proposed. We<lb/>promise
                            that nothing shall be wanting on<lb/>our part to give aid to so
                            desirable a<lb/>thing in our country. Our situation at<lb/>present will
                            not admit of carrying such<lb/>a plan so fully into execution as
                            might<lb/>be desired by our brothers; but that, I<lb/>hope, will not
                            prevent you from making<lb/>trial. If we had such tools as you
                            make<lb/>use of and which add so much to your<lb/>comfort—for we have
                            been lost in wonder<lb/>at what we have seen amongst you—if<lb/>we had
                            these instruments, we should, I<lb/>hope, be willing to use them; and in
                            the<lb/>course of a little time, there would be<lb/>people amongst us
                            that would know well<lb/>how to use them, through the
                            assistance<lb/>they might obtain from you and the rest<lb/>of our white
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>Whatever goods you may have in store<lb/>for
                            your red brothers, we cannot but wish<lb/>that you will shew them to us
                            as soon<lb/>as possible. That we can yet live upon<lb/>the game of our
                            country, is true; but<lb/>we know that this will not be the
                            case<lb/>long. Brothers, from the great things and<lb/>the astonishing
                            wonders which we have<lb/>seen among you, and finding that they<lb/>all
                            come out of the earth, it makes me anx-<lb/>ious to try if I cannot get
                            some for my-<lb/>self. I hope, brothers, that by the aid<lb/>of the
                            Great Spirit, and of our friends<lb/>and brothers, the Quakers, together
                            with<lb/>the government of the United States, that<lb/>we shall yet be
                            enabled to get these good<lb/>things for ourselves—such as will
                            make<lb/>us, our women, and our children happy.</p>
                        <p>Brothers,<lb/>We do not know what our brothers, the<lb/>Quakers of
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, may have in
                            con-<lb/>templation to do for their red brethren, but<lb/>we hope it
                            will be something that will add<lb/>to our comfort; we hope it will be
                            some-<lb/>thing by which we shall profit; something<lb/>by which we
                            shall be enabled to cultivate<lb/>our lands, and live by the fruits of
                            the<lb/>earth. We have been walking in a thorny<lb/>path; we want to get
                            into your track and<lb/>follow it; and the sooner this is put
                            into<lb/>our power, I am convinced the better it<lb/>will be for our red
                            brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I have not much to say further; what<lb/>has
                            now been said to you is the voice<lb/>of the <orgName key="potaw"

                            we<lb/>will trust; we shall then get it, and do<lb/>now assure you, that

                        <p>Proceedings of a committee appointed by the<lb/>yearly meeting of the
                            respectable society of<lb/>Friends, with the Indian
                            chiefs—conclud-<lb/>ed from yesterday’s Gazette.</p>
                        <p>SECOND CONFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>One of the society of Friends opened the<lb/>conference as follows:</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>WHEN the talk which we had last<lb/>evening at
                            this place ended, I believe it<lb/>was generally understood that the
                            subject-<lb/>matter which had been spoken to was sa-<lb/>tisfactory; but
                            on considering further,<lb/>some of us though that there were
                            some<lb/>things of considerable importance, which<lb/>had not been
                            spoken upon—and thought<lb/>that it would be right to have another
                            op-<lb/>portunity. We are accordingly again<lb/>assembled—and seeing
                            that it has been<lb/>the will of the Great Spirit and Father of <lb/>us
                            all, to permit us thus to come together<lb/>again, it is my desire that
                            any thing we<lb/>may feel in our hearts that may be likely to<lb/>have a
                            tendency to promote the good of<lb/>our red brethren, may be freely
                            spoken.</p>
                        <p>Another Friend next addressed them as<lb/>follows:</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>I may tell you, I have been made glad,<lb/>that
                            I have an opportunity of sitting once<lb/>more with you; and as I have
                            found that<lb/>the more I am with you, the more the<lb/>love I have felt
                            for you has increased, and<lb/>the stronger has been my desire for
                            your<lb/>welfare, and that this love has taken away<lb/>all fear of
                            giving offence; I feel myself<lb/>authorized, I think, as a brother, to
                            use<lb/>freedom of speech with you, and in the<lb/>freedom which I feel,
                            under the influence<lb/>of that love which I trust has been
                            impress-<lb/>ed upon my heart by the great and good<lb/>Spirit, who as
                            he has made us all of one<lb/>blood so he requires of us that we
                            should<lb/> ove one another. I may tell you brothers,<lb/>that, when I
                            was in the Indian country,<lb/>I had frequent opportunities of
                            observing<lb/>the pernicious consequences of the use of<lb/>spirituous
                            liquors, with which the Indians<lb/>were furnished by the traders, and
                            as I<lb/>have reason to believe, that you who are<lb/>now present are
                            wise men, men who have<lb/>eyes in your heads, and are able to
                            see<lb/>things as they really are, I have felt a de-<lb/>sire in my
                            heart to know your opinions,<lb/>and what is your judgment
                            concerning<lb/>this thing—the using spiritous liquors<lb/>to excess.
                            Believing brothers, that if<lb/>you have seen things in the same light
                            in<lb/>which I have seen them, that you would<lb/>be desirous that a
                            stop might be put to the<lb/>evils that arise from the use of so
                            destruct-<lb/>tive a liquor, I may tell you, brothers,<lb/>who are now
                            present, as well as the In-<lb/>dians in general, that I have believed
                            there<lb/>is not any thing that stands more in your<lb/>way to
                            improvement than this; the too<lb/>frequent use of spiritous liquors:
                            and I<lb/>have thought that if you are of the same<lb/>mind with us who
                            are your Friends, and<lb/>have your good at heart, that it would
                            be<lb/>right for us to take the subject into our<lb/>serious
                            consideration, to endeavor to dis-<lb/>cover, whether there may not be
                            some steps<lb/>taken, that would put a check upon this<lb/>pernicious
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>Now, brothers, as a hint of this sort was<lb/>omitted when we were
                            together last even-<lb/>ing, some of us did not find our minds
                            easy:<lb/>we thought it ought to have come under<lb/>consideration,
                            hoping that you who, as I<lb/>have already said, have eyes in your
                            heads,<lb/>and can see for yourselves, have had this<lb/>subject under
                            your consideration. We now<lb/>hope brothers that you will express
                            your-<lb/>selves freely to us on this subject, and let<lb/>us know how
                            it has appeared to you.<lb/>After which, way perhaps will open
                            for<lb/>some further observations from us.</p>
                        <p>After a short pause the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                            on<lb/>his seat expresses, I will now make some<lb/>reply, if none of my
                            brothers have further to say.</p>
                        <p>He was desired to proceed—when rising on<lb/>his feet he said,</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I am happy to find that it has
                            pleased<lb/>the Great Spirit, that we should again this<lb/>evening meet
                            in the same house in which<lb/>we held our council yesterday. I am
                            hap-<lb/>py to find that it is the will of the Great<lb/>and Good
                            Spirit, that we should discover,<lb/>there was something yesterday not
                            menti-<lb/>oned, that was highly necessary for the<lb/>welfare of your
                            red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>I am glad to find that it has pleased
                            the<lb/>Great Spirit to put a wish in your hearts<lb/>to know our
                            opinions on the subject you<lb/>have mentioned; a subject of the
                            greatest<lb/>moment to us. What you have said re-<lb/>lative to our
                            being one flesh and one blood<lb/>is true. Your brothers the Indians
                            believe<lb/>that it is in this light the Great Spirit con-<lb/>siders
                            all mankind.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>My brother chiefs that are now
                            present,<lb/>with myself, are happy to find, that you<lb/>have a good
                            opinion of us. You say, that<lb/>you apprehend we have eyes in our
                            heads,<lb/>and can clearly see for ourselves those<lb/>things that are
                            injurious to us; this, my<lb/>friends and brothers, is the case; we
                            clear-<lb/>ly see these things: my brother chiefs that<lb/>are now
                            present with me, as well as myself,<lb/>have long seen them; we have
                            long lament-<lb/>ed these great evils that have raged in
                            our<lb/>country, and that have done your red<lb/>brethren so much harm;
                            we have applied<lb/>for redress, and endeavored to have them<lb/>removed
                            from amongst us.</p>
                        <p>When our forefathers met first on this<lb/>Island, your red brethren then
                            were numer-<lb/>ous; but since the introduction amongst<lb/>us of what
                            you call spirituous liquors, and<lb/>what we think may justly be called
                            poison,<lb/>our numbers are greatly diminished: It<lb/>has destroyed a
                            great part of our red bre-<lb/>thren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I am glad to hear you observe, that
                            free-<lb/>dom of speech ought always to be made<lb/>use of amongst
                            brothers; this, brothers,<lb/>really ought to be the case. I will
                            now,<lb/>therefore, take the liberty to mention, that<lb/>most of the
                            exciting evils amongst your red<lb/>brethren, have been caught from the
                            white<lb/>people; not only that liquor that destroys<lb/>us daily, but
                            many diseases that our fore-<lb/>fathers were ignorant of before they
                            say<lb/>you.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I am glad, with my brother chiefs,
                            that<lb/>are now present, to find that you are rea-<lb/>dy to assist us
                            in every thing that will add<lb/>to our good: we hope that the
                            Great<lb/>Spirit will aid you in all your good under-<lb/>takings with
                            respect to us. We plainly<lb/>perceive, brothers, that you see that
                            very<lb/>evil that destroys your red brethren. It<lb/>is not an evil,
                            brothers, of our own making;<lb/>we have not placed it amongst us by the
                            white<lb/>people; we look up to them to remove it<lb/>out of our
                            country: If they have that<lb/>friendship for us which they tell us
                            they<lb/>have, they certainly will not let it conti-<lb/>nue amongst us
                            any longer. Our repeat-<lb/>ed entreaties to those who bring this
                            evil<lb/>amongst us, we find, has not the desired<lb/>effect. We tell
                            them—Brothers, fetch us<lb/>useful things; bring goods that will
                            clothe<lb/>us, our women and our children, and not<lb/>this evil liquor
                            that destroys our reason—<lb/>that destroys our health—that
                            destroys<lb/>our lives: But all we can say on the sub-<lb/>ject is of no
                            service, nor gives relief to<lb/>your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I am glad that you have seen into
                            this<lb/>business as we do—I rejoice to find that<lb/>you agree in
                            opinion with us, and express<lb/>an anxiety to be, if possible, of
                            service to<lb/>us, to remove this great evil out of our<lb/>country—an
                            evil that has had so much<lb/>room in it—that has destroyed so
                            many<lb/>of our lives that it causes our young men<lb/>to say, <said>We
                                had better be at war with<lb/>the white people: this liquor that
                                they in-<lb/>troduce into our country is more to be<lb/>feared than
                                the gun and the tomahawk:<lb/>there are more of us dead since the
                                treaty<pb n="55" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_053"/><lb/>of Grenville, than we lost by the
                                six<lb/>years war before; it is all owning to the in-<lb/>troduction
                                of this liquor amongst us.</said>—<lb/>Brothers, how to remove this
                            evil from our<lb/>country we do not know; if we had known<lb/>that it
                            would have been a proper subject to<lb/>have mentioned to you in our
                            council yes-<lb/>terday, we should surely have done it.<lb/>This
                            subject, brothers, composes a part of<lb/>what we intend to make known
                            to the great<lb/>council of our white brethren. On our<lb/>arrival
                            there, we shall endeavor to explain<lb/>to our great father, the
                            president, a great<lb/>many evils that have arisen in our
                            country<lb/>from the introduction of this liquor by the<lb/>white
                            traders.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>In addition to what I have before
                            ob-<lb/>served of this great evil in the country of<lb/>your red
                            brethren, I will say further, that<lb/>it has made us poor. It is this
                            liquor that<lb/>causes our young men to go without<lb/>clothes, our
                            women and children to go<lb/>without any thing to eat; and sorry am
                            I<lb/>to mention now to you, brothers, that the<lb/>evil is increasing
                            every day, as the white<lb/>settlers come nearer to us, and bring
                            those<lb/>kettles they boil that stuff in they call whis-<lb/>key, of
                            which our young men are so ex-<lb/>tremely fond. Brothers, when our
                            young<lb/>men have been out hunting, and are return-<lb/>ing home loaded
                            with skins and furs, on<lb/>their way if it happens that they
                            come<lb/>along where some of this whiskey is depo-<lb/>sited, the white
                            man who sells it tells them<lb/>to take a little drink; some of them
                            will<lb/>say, No, I do not want it—they go on till<lb/>they come to
                            another house, where they<lb/>find more of the same kind of drink; it
                            is<lb/>there again offered, they refuse, and again<lb/>the third time,
                            but finally the fourth or<lb/>fifth time one accepts of it and takes
                            a<lb/>drink, and getting one he wants another,<lb/>and then a third and
                            a fourth till his senses<lb/>have left him. After his reason
                            comes<lb/>back again to him, he asks for his peltry:<lb/>The answer is,
                            you have drank them.<lb/>Where is my gun? It is gone. Where is
                            my<lb/>shirt? You have sold it for whiskey!! Now,<lb/>brothers, figure
                            to yourselves what a con-<lb/>dition this man must be in; he has a
                            fami-<lb/>ly at home, a wife and children that stand<lb/>in need of the
                            profits of his hunting: what<lb/>must their wants be when he himself is
                            even<lb/>without a shirt?</p>
                        <p>This, Brothers, I can assure you, is a<lb/>fact that often happens among
                            us; as I<lb/>have before observed, we have no means<lb/>to prevent it.
                            If you, Brothers, have it<lb/>in your power to render us any
                            assistance,<lb/>we hope the Great Spirit will aid you—<lb/>we shall lay
                            these evils before our great<lb/>and good father; we hope he will
                            remove<lb/>them from amongst us; we shall assure<lb/>him that if he does
                            not, there will not be<lb/>many of his red children living long in
                            our<lb/>country. The Great Spirit, Brothers, has<lb/>made you see as we
                            see; we hope, Bro-<lb/>thers, and expect, that if you have any
                            in-<lb/>fluence with the great council of the Unit-<lb/>ed States, that
                            you will make use of it in<lb/>behalf of your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>The talks that you delivered to us
                            when<lb/>we were in council yesterday, were cerain-<lb/>ly highly
                            pleasing to myself as well as to<lb/>my brother chiefs; we rejoiced to
                            hear<lb/>you speak such words to us; but we all<lb/>plainly saw that
                            there was a great difficulty<lb/>in the way that ought to be removed
                            be-<lb/>fore your good intentions towards us could<lb/>be carried into
                            effect: we agree with you,<lb/>Brothers, that this great evil amongst
                            us,<lb/>spirituous liquors, must first be removed;<lb/>after this is
                            done, we hope you will find<lb/>an easy access to us, much earlier than
                            you<lb/>can have at present.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I hope that if we all try to prevent
                            the<lb/>introduction of spiritous liquors in the<lb/>country of your red
                            brethren, that the<lb/>Great Spirit will aid us in it, and that
                            we<lb/>shall meet with no difficulty in doing it;<lb/>after this is
                            done, we hope that the great<lb/>services you have designed to do for
                            us, the<lb/>great things mentioned by you in our<lb/>council yesterday,
                            may take place and<lb/>have that success you so much desire.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>You have asked us our opinion on
                            the<lb/>subject of the introduction of spiritous li-<lb/>quors into our
                            country. I have now given<lb/>it to you. If I have given it to you in
                            such<lb/>a manner that you do not understand me,<lb/>I would wish to be
                            make known to<lb/>every body. We have our enemies in our<lb/>own country
                            as all other persons have in<lb/>theirs; it is no unusual thing,
                            Brothers,<lb/>to hear some people amongst us, (you<lb/>will perceive,
                            Brothers, that these are<lb/>people that are interested in keeping
                            us<lb/>ignorant,) when they hear talks that have<lb/>been delivered by
                            our chiefs to people that<lb/>are capable of rendering us services,
                            they<lb/>say to our people, <said>do you not hear?<lb/>your chiefs have
                                sold you—your chiefs<lb/>have sold your lands.</said> They put
                            bad<lb/>stories in the mouths of our young men:<lb/>for this reason,
                            Brothers, all that I have<lb/>said I wish to be made public; I
                            wish<lb/>every body to know it. I only mention<lb/>this to you,
                            Brothers; if it is improper,<lb/>I have no objection to your keeping
                            it<lb/>amongst yourselves, but if it could be<lb/>made public I would
                            wish it—I have nothing<lb/>further to say. Sits down.</p>

                        <p>My Brothers and Friends,<lb/>I have nothing to say on the subject,<lb/>we
                            have now been talking over. My friend<lb/>the <persName key="lturt1"
                                >Little Turtle</persName> has given you a full an-<lb/>swer to those

                            but<lb/>one voice.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,<lb/>We have never had it in our power to<lb/>hold
                            such talks with you at this place be-<lb/>fore. We have frequently had
                            talks of<lb/>this kind with our brothers, the Quakers<lb/>of <placeName
                                key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>; they always appeared<lb/>very
                            glad to see us, and we find you the<lb/>same. We hope brothers, that
                            your<lb/>friendship and ours will never be broken.<lb/>Sits down.</p>
                        <p>The friend who delivered the second<lb/>communication, then again
                            addressed them<lb/>as follows:</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers,<lb/>What you have communicated to us at<lb/>this
                            time, has been clearly understood—<lb/>and we are glad to find that you
                            see things<lb/>in the same light that we see them. The<lb/>several
                            matters you have mentioned, and<lb/>the difficulties you have stated,
                            claim our<lb/>sympathy and solid consideration, and we<lb/>shall, I
                            trust, take the subject up, and if<lb/>way should open for us to move
                            forward,<lb/>in aiding you in your application to the<lb/>general
                            government, we shall be willing,<lb/>either on this occasion, or any
                            other, to<lb/>render every service in our power.</p>
                        <p>To the Congress of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The memoral of the committee appointed<lb/>for Indian affairs by the
                            yearly meeting<lb/>of Friends, held in <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>,<lb/>Respectfully represents—</p>
                        <p>THAT a concern to introduce among<lb/>some of the Indian tribes

                            most simple and useful arts<lb/>of civil life, being several years since
                            laid<lb/>before our yearly meeting, a committee<lb/>was appointed by
                            that body to visit them,<lb/>to examine their situation, and
                            endeavor<lb/>to ascertain in what manner so desirable a<lb/>purpose
                            could be both effected—A part of<lb/>that committee after having
                            obtained the<lb/>approbation of the president of the United<lb/>States,
                            proceeded to perform the service<lb/>assigned them, and the result of
                            their<lb/>enquiries and observations, as reported to<lb/>the yearly
                            meeting, was, that the quantity<lb/>of spirituous liquors with which
                            those<lb/>people are supplied by traders and frontier<lb/>settlers, must
                            counteract the effect of every<lb/>measure, however wise of salutary,
                            which<lb/>can be devised to improve their situation.</p>
                        <p>The truth of this being abundantly<lb/>confirmed by a speech recently
                            made before<lb/>us by the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName> chief,

                            of such<lb/>magnitude, that unless it can be altogether<lb/>removed, or
                            greatly restrained, no ration-<lb/>al hope of success in the proposed
                            under-<lb/>taking can be entertained, we are induced<lb/>to solicit the
                            attention of the national le-<lb/>gislature to this interesting and
                            important<lb/>subject, a subject which we believe involves<lb/>not only
                            their future welfare, but even<lb/>their very existence as a
                            people.<lb/>Signed on behalf of the committee by<lb/><list>

                        <p>The Meeting was last year informed<lb/>that the Western Indians in the

                            the <placeName key="miamr">Miami</placeName> of the Lake, and at

                        <p>Shortly after our arrival we convened a few<lb/>Indians, amongst whom
                            were the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> and<lb/>the
                                <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> (by whom we were

                            and ac-<lb/>quianted them through the interpreter <persName key="wwell1"
                                >William Wells</persName><lb/>with the contents of the letter from
                            the committee<lb/>directed to them and others. After which we
                            expressed<lb/>to them a desire to see their chiefs and young
                            men<lb/>more generally, having as we believed some things of<lb/>great
                            importance, to their welfare to communicate<lb/>and knowing that it was
                            the season of the year in<lb/>which most of the Indians were engaged in
                            their<lb/>hunting and Sugar Camps, we requested them to<lb/>convene as
                            many of their chiefs and principal young<lb/>men as could with
                            convenience be collected in the<lb/>course of a few days. They expressed
                            a desire that<lb/>we would not be in haste to return, but would
                            remain<lb/>some time in their country, observing, that it was<lb/>their
                            desire we should see their people generally, &amp;<lb/>that the season
                            of the year was near at hand, for<lb/>them to return to their Towns when
                            they could readily<lb/>convene the most of them, adding, that they
                            could<lb/>now collect a considerable number of their indolent<lb/>ones,
                            who were too lazy to hunt or make sugar, but<lb/>such they did not wish
                            us to see</p>
                        <p>We informed them that we had with us<lb/><persName key="pdeni1">Philip
                                Dennis</persName> who was willing to remain with them<lb/>during the
                            season for the purpose of assisting them in<lb/>raising a crop of corn,
                            and shewing them how to<lb/>do other things, that the time for him to
                            commence his<pb n="73" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_070"/><lb/>operations being near at hand, required
                            that we<lb/>should make haste. They replied that our reasons
                            for<lb/>wishing them to meet early were very good and that<lb/>they
                            would meet us on the <date when="1804-04-11">11 of the 4
                            Month</date></p>
                        <p>At that time we were met by several of their<lb/>chiefs a considerable
                            number of their principal young<lb/>men as also several of their
                            women—when they informed<lb/>us that they were ready to hear any
                            communications<lb/>from us and as they had previously requested,
                            that<lb/>what we had to say might be put upon Paper, that<lb/>they might
                            communicate our words, to the Indians<lb/>when generally assembled we

                                    mode of living much more cer-<lb/>tain and which will expose
                                    your bodies less to the<lb/>inclemences of the weather than is
                                    attendant upon hunting<lb/>it will lead you to have fixed
                                    homes—you will build<lb/>comfortable dwelling houses for

                                <p>Brothers<lb/>We will mention that the time was<lb/>when the

                                    the great water in the same manner that our<lb/>red brothers now
                                    live, the winters can yet be counted<lb/>when they went almost
                                    naked, when they procured their<lb/>living by fishing and by the
                                    bow and arrow in hunting &amp;<lb/>when they lived in houses no
                                    better than yours. they<lb/>were encouraged by some who came
                                    from towards<lb/>the sun rising and lived amongst them to
                                    change<lb/>their mode of living—they did change—they
                                    cultivated<lb/>the Earth, and we are sure the change was a
                                    happy<lb/>one</p>
                                <p>Brothers<lb/>We are not ashamed to acknowledge<lb/>that the time
                                    was, when our forefathers rejoiced at<lb/>finding a wild Plum
                                    Tree or at killing a little<lb/>game, and that they wandered up
                                    &amp; down living on<lb/>the uncertain supplies of fishing and
                                    hunting, but<lb/>brothers for your encouragement we mention,
                                    that<lb/>by turning their attention to the cultivation of
                                    the<lb/>Earth, instead of the Plum tree, they soon had
                                    orchards<lb/>of many kinds of good Fruit—instead of the wild
                                    game<lb/>they soon had large numbers of Cattle, of horses of
                                    sheep<lb/>of hogs and other useful animals, and instead
                                    of<lb/>their forests in many places they had large fields
                                    of<lb/>Corn and other Grain, as also many other
                                    valuable<lb/>productions of the Earth</p>
                                <p>Brothers<lb/>We hope your Eyes will be open to see clearly<pb

                                        You<lb/>have been very particular in pointing out to us

                            accordingly<lb/>appointed a guide, who together with <persName

                            Sciatic<pb n="89" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_086"/><lb/>complaint so that it was with difficulty he
                            could<lb/>go about, which has no doubt disabled him from do-<lb/>ing as
                            much as he other ways would have done. He<lb/>informs that he had
                            between 16 &amp; 20 acres of land<lb/>enclosed under a substancial fence
                            8 rails high, and<lb/>that he had planted about 8 acres of corn,

                            informs<lb/>that he has enjoyed a good state of health since he<lb/>had
                            recovered from the complaint above mentioned<lb/>that his situation was
                            a healthy one and that the<lb/>springs of water were very good—he
                            further states that<lb/>his corn made an excellent appearance, having 2
                            &amp; 3<lb/>Ears on a stalk that he had sown one acre in Tur-<lb/>nips
                            which looked well, that a number of Indians<lb/>had been encamped near
                            him for the purpose of<lb/>hunting, that only one family had setled
                            perma-<lb/>nently at his station which onsisted on 7 grown
                            persons<lb/>who he says have been industrious and attended to<lb/>his

                            very sociable, and that 55 Eal river<lb/>Indians had been at his
                            station, who acknowledged<lb/>that his corn was equal to any they had
                            ever seen on<lb/>the <placeName key="wabas">Wabash</placeName>. He also
                            says he has had a conference<lb/>with <persName key="samuel"

                            informs<pb n="90" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_087"/><lb/>that they would gladly receive assistance
                            from<lb/>Friends. Some farming utensils such as Plows, Hoes<lb/>&amp;
                            axes he says would be very acceptable. This chief<lb/>added that he does
                            not expect they will make a<lb/>great progress immediately but thinks it
                            a proper<lb/>time to lay a foundation for their children and is<lb/>in
                            hopes the present establishment will make a<lb/>begining. <persName

                            and expected soon after the date<lb/>of his last letter to begin another
                            to be 16 by 32 feet<lb/>and 1 ½ Stories high, and observes he very
                            sensibly feel<lb/>the lonesomeness of his situation, but on reflecting
                            upon<lb/>the business in which he is engaged and the<lb/>distressed
                            situation of the poor Indians he feels no<lb/>cause of regret</p>

                                Dennis</persName> who remained with them during the past<lb/>season
                            has returned with them during the past<lb/>season has returned. He
                            informs us that he spent<lb/>the season agreeably with them and was
                            favoured<lb/>to enjoy a good portion of health whilst there—<lb/>He
                            raised 400 bushels of corn but this was not divided<lb/>when he left
                            that Country on account of the dispersed<lb/>situation of the Indians,
                            he had however secured it<lb/>in substantial well covered cribs, and had
                                engaged<lb/><persName key="wwell1">William Wells</persName> to

                            Indians<lb/>from their hunting Camps. He also raised

                            Beans<lb/>Parsnips &amp; other garden vegetables and left at

                            farm in the spring and had no other food than<lb/>what they gathered in
                            the woods. He also built a<lb/>house 32 feet long &amp; 17 feet wide 1 ½
                            stories high, with<lb/>floors and partitions—one end of which he
                            finished</p>
                        <p>He further informs that the Indians who remained<lb/>with him were very
                            industrious and attended to his directions<lb/>that the young women
                            wished to work out in preparing the<lb/>ground and in tending the corn
                            from which he had<lb/>dissuaded them. And as some spinning wheels had
                            just<lb/>arrived at <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName> which
                            had been sent on by<lb/>government he had encouraged these young women
                            to<lb/>go there and learn to spin &amp; knot of a woman
                            that<lb/>happened to be there—this they did and soon learned<lb/>both to
                            spin &amp; knit and that he left them knitting yarn<lb/>of their own
                            spinning and gives it as his opinion that<lb/>there is encouragement for
                            friends to persevere. A<lb/>considerable number of <orgName key="eel"
                                >Eal river Indians</orgName> are about to<lb/>settle near the place
                            he cultivated. This being it that<lb/>country has been attended with
                            considerable expence but<lb/>should another person go out to them the
                            disbursement<lb/>need not be as great a considerable piece of land
                            being<lb/>now enclosed and a house built. He also informs that<lb/>one
                            of his horses died a few days before he left that country<lb/>and that
                            previous to his departure he was with a number<pb n="108" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_105"/><lb/>of
                            principal Indian chiefs who requested him to<lb/>inform friends that
                            they and the Indians generally were<lb/>much obliged to friends for the
                            assistance they had given<lb/>them, and hoped we would continue our
                            friendship<lb/>towards them and that nothing might happen
                            to<lb/>discourage us, he also says that all the Indians he
                            was<lb/>amongst were very friendly as was also <persName key="wwell1"

                            that as several<lb/>of the Tribes had requested of Government to

                        <p>Some time since a committee of<lb/>seven men were sent to us by your

                            occasion of their coming was to attend to the<lb/>business we were
                            speaking of when I was at Baltimore<lb/>the next spring there were
                            letters sent out and the com-<lb/>mittee came out least the letters
                            should have been<lb/>lost, that they might communicate the same
                            things<lb/>sent in them, i e</p>
                        <p>Brothers<lb/>The reasons of our coming are we not<lb/>knowing but that
                            the letters might be lost, for in<lb/>those letters, were contained all
                            the information;<lb/>How it happened when we got first acquainted
                            with<lb/>the <orgName key="delaware">Dellaware Nation</orgName> your
                            Nephew, now our design<lb/>is to do something for the <orgName

                            at the same<lb/>time we express our friendship for all Nations;
                            The<lb/>Quakers have taken up a plan for doing something<lb/>for the

                            the President of the United States and<pb n="119" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_116"/><lb/>King of England,
                            who give you presents every year<lb/>--the President gives 1000 $
                            annually, we have a design<lb/>to go on the same footing, and give $1000
                            a year, if<lb/>the chiefs our Brothers would accept of it. We
                            tell<lb/>you brothers we want to take care of you and give<lb/>you good
                            things, the goods we shall give you are<lb/>of our own make, they will
                            be good and of more<lb/>value than those the President gives, if the
                            chiefs com-<lb/>ply with our offer we desire them to come to <placeName

                            got the Presidents permit,--These matters are setled<lb/>and we have now
                            got $100 on hand towards building<lb/>you a Mill, we will also help you
                            in cultivating<lb/>your lands and in building houses—another
                            thing<lb/>brothers we wish you to send some of your children<lb/>to us,
                            and we will school them and give them learning<lb/>as the Wyandots are
                            the only Nation that have no<pb n="120" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_117"/><lb/>learned men amongst them,

                        <p>This is all we understood was offered to us as<lb/>explained by out

                            My<lb/>answer then was, that I would not give you an answer<lb/>until I
                            went to see the Brown’s Town chiefs, which<lb/>should be done in the
                            course of that summer, the<lb/>chiefs when we met thought it too
                            difficult to go<lb/>they desired me to write on to you, and
                            what<lb/>ever I did they would agree to</p>
                        <p>Brethren Quakers give attention!<lb/>I send a few words<lb/>to you now;
                            the plan you have thought of is<lb/>a very good one, and all the chiefs
                            thank you for<lb/>having compassion on us, for we are poor &amp;
                            needy,<lb/>but there is one difficulty in the way, your res-<lb/>pecting
                            two Nations, more than the rest, we say,<lb/>the difficulty with the
                            chiefs is your respecting, two<lb/>nations more than the rest—other
                            nations might<lb/>look upon us with envy, and as they are not men
                            of<lb/>knowledge, they might fall on us and cut us off<lb/>this is the
                            only difficulty in the way we wish<lb/>our brethren Quakers to consider
                            this matter, &amp;<lb/>the danger we shall be in, and if they are
                            deter-<lb/>mined to help us to send us word in the spring early<lb/>and
                            also to see how many nations they will help<pb n="121" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_118"/><lb/>if you send
                            on in the spring and are still de-<lb/>termined to help us, we shall
                            then have matters<lb/>regulated and will accept your offer</p>
                        <p>Brothers!<lb/>We have both been under the same diffi-<lb/>culty it is
                            five years since the brethren were here<lb/>and I have heard no word,
                            and finally concluded<lb/>that they had given up doing any thing,
                            until<lb/>this letter came into my hands—we all thank<lb/>you heartily
                            for not giving it up altogether. In<lb/>regard to the letter now before
                            us, the chiefs at<lb/><placeName key="browt">Brown’s Town</placeName>
                            are pleased and accept the offer, we<lb/>now leave it with our brethren
                            if they conclude to<lb/>help us either to send us another letter, and
                            give<lb/>us notice or send the things they propose, we wish<lb/>four
                            pair of plow Irons at this place</p>
                        <p>Brethren!<lb/>If you see fit to send a letter this fall<lb/>or early in
                            the spring, or to send on your things di-<lb/>rectly, we leave the
                            matter with yourselves. In<lb/>regard to schools Brethren, by that time
                            some of<lb/>our people will determine on the children, they<lb/>will
                            send to school and what they shall study</p>
                        <p>The chiefs return you thanks that you have<lb/>not given over helping
                            them and are now willing to<lb/>accept your offer, the ground of our

                        <p>Brothers!<lb/>We are sorry to perceive by this speech<lb/>that our
                            intentions towards you have been greatly<lb/>misrepresented—we suppose
                            the interpreters between<lb/>us did not understand our language
                            suffice-<lb/>ently well to explain to you our meaning<lb/>as we have not
                            written any letter conveying to you the<lb/>offers you mention, nor has
                            any person authorized<lb/>by us, ever held out any such proposals,
                            as<lb/>you appear to think you have received—the only<lb/>letter we ever
                            wrote to you, we herewith send you<lb/>an exact copy of, by reading of
                            it you will see<lb/>the reasons why we have not given you more
                            assis-<lb/>tance</p>
                        <p>Brothers!<lb/>The misrepresentations which have<pb n="126" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_123"/><lb/>been
                            made to you, renders it necessary for<lb/>us, at this time, to explain
                            our views and pros-<lb/>pects at large towards you, that may not
                            any<lb/>longer be deceived, or hereafter suppose, we have<lb/>held out
                            any expectations to you, which it<lb/>was not our intention to have
                            realized</p>
                        <p>Brothers!<lb/>About Ten years ago when many of<lb/>your brethren the
                            Quakers, were assembled in their<lb/>great council to transact the
                            affairs of their<lb/>society we believed that the great Spirit
                            put<lb/>it into our hearts to endeavour to do something<lb/>towards the
                            assistance of our Indian Brethren<lb/>who we believed suffered much for
                            the want of<lb/>food and cloathing by not knowing how to
                            cultivate<lb/>their lands and make cloathes for themselves as<lb/>the
                            white people do, we therefore appointed some<lb/>of our brethren to take
                            such of our red brothers by<lb/>the hand as would be willing to be
                            instructed<lb/>by us in the use of the Plow, the Hoe and other<lb/>Tools
                            employed by us in raising corn and other grain</p>
                        <p>Brothers<lb/>These of our brethren soon after bean<lb/>to look round and
                            see which of the Indian Nations<lb/>would be most likely to be willing
                            to receive<lb/>instruction from us, we had not at that time<lb/>any
                            particular prospects exclusively towards any<lb/>Tribe or nation, we
                            felt them all as brethren<pb n="127" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_124"/><lb/>whom we loved, and were
                            disposed to assist as far<lb/>as our power extended either of them whom
                            we<lb/>might find willing to accept of our aid</p>
                        <p>Brothers!<lb/>After having visited several Indian<lb/>families of the
                                <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> and <orgName key="delaware"
                                >Delaware</orgName> Nations<lb/>and informed them of our intentions,
                            we received<lb/>about 7 years ago a speech from our brother <persName
                                key="tarh1">Tarhic</persName><lb/>delivered at <placeName

                                >Delaware</orgName> Nations in which we were invited<lb/>to attend
                            at <placeName key="sandu">San Dusky</placeName> the next summer
                            and<lb/>talk together on the subject of assisting you</p>
                        <p>Brothers<lb/>Seven of us accordingly at the time ap-<lb/>pointed made a
                            visit to <placeName key="sandu">San Dusky</placeName> and in
                            a<lb/>Council which they then had with <persName key="tarh1"
                                >Tarhic</persName> at his<lb/>own house, with two other chiefs and
                            many hun-<lb/>ters, we told you that it had arrisen in our<lb/>hearts,
                            to try and afford you some assistance in<lb/>teaching you how to
                            cultivate your lands &amp; make<lb/>clothing, in reply our brother
                                <persName key="tarh1">Tarhic</persName> informed us<lb/>on behalf of
                            himself and the other chiefs present<lb/>that they could not give us any
                            answer at that<lb/>time, but would in a general council of
                            their<lb/>chiefs and people consult together and send a<lb/>written
                            answer to us as soon as you came to a<lb/>conclusion amongst
                            yourselves</p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_125"/>
                        <p>Brothers<lb/>We have never since that time<lb/>until now received any
                            direct communication<lb/>from you—after having waited three years<lb/>
                            we were discouraged and thought you had<lb/>declined accepting any
                            assistance from us<lb/>therefore turned our attention towards
                            some<lb/>other Nations, who we knew were willing &amp;<lb/>anxious to
                            receive help from us</p>
                        <p>Brothers<lb/>Having now entered into engagements<lb/>with our brothers

                            in our power to extend much aid<lb/>to you at this time, we have not the

                            assistance—we<lb/>hope they will before a great while, by
                            industry<lb/>and care learn to do without much of our<lb/>help, as their
                            father the President of the United<lb/>States and the Secretary of War
                            we know are<lb/>disposed to render these and the whole of

                            making their situations more comforta-<lb/>ble, and we hope the support
                            they will<lb/>continue to receive from them will release us<pb n="129"

                        <p>In the latter end of last Month I<lb/>had the honor to receive a packet

                                >Nation</orgName> live in those two<lb/>Villages, where also resides

                                >Nation</orgName>. I have conferred with this Inter-<lb/>preter and

                                key="sandu">San Duskey</placeName><lb/>I should be glad of
                            information from you on<lb/>this point. Give me leave to inform you,
                            that<lb/>those <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandots</orgName> of the two
                            Villages before mentioned<lb/>are a very deserving people, temperate,
                            sober, reli-<lb/>gious in their way and have already
                            become<lb/>agriculterists in part, but need aid and encoura-<lb/>gement,
                            with which I have no doubt they would soon<lb/>quit the hunting life
                            altogether, and advance ra-<lb/>pidly to a state of compleat
                            civilization. Indeed<lb/>from what I have seen in this people I am
                            greatly<lb/>confirmed in a favourite opinion long entertained<lb/>by me,
                            that the Indians are capable of becoming<lb/>as well civilized as any
                            people in the world. The<lb/>Indians now in question are very anxious to
                            make<lb/>further advanced in agriculture and knowledge<lb/>and have
                            repeatedly signified to me their ardent<lb/>wish for a few good farmers
                            to come amongst them<lb/>also some mechanicks, particularly a
                            blacksmith<lb/>--As these Indians have frequent communications<lb/>with
                            their brethren at <placeName key="sandu">Sanduskey</placeName> I thought
                            proper<lb/>to deliver your address to their Interpreter desiring him<pb

                            reading and<lb/>explaining it to the chiefs there or if the

                                >Sandusky</placeName><lb/>chiefs, I desired him to explain it to
                            them; and<lb/>told him to return the orriginal to me, with<lb/>an answer
                            from the <placeName key="sandu">Sanduskey</placeName> chiefs as soon
                            as<lb/>possible, all which he promised to do. When I<lb/>receive an
                            answer it will be communicated<lb/>to you without delay</p>
                        <p>As Cash is excessively scarce in this country &amp;<lb/>Credit cannot be
                            obtained but for a few days<lb/>especially on Iron Work, I shall find it
                            necessary to<lb/>advance the Cash, if I should order the utensils
                            to<lb/>be made which are mentioned in your address.<lb/>Besides, the
                            mode of remiting payments to this place<lb/>in cash per mail is subject
                            to great delays and<lb/>risques. I would therefore suggest to you, the
                            pro-<lb/>priety of either drawing yourselves on some<lb/>friend here who
                            would be accommodated by a<lb/>payment in <placeName key="balti1"

                            &amp;<lb/>if committed to me it shall be faithfully applied
                            &amp;<lb/>accounted for to you<pb n="137" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_134"/>
                            <lb/>Friends! I approve greatly of your charitable <lb/>intentions
                            towards the Indians, and applaud your <lb/>benevolent and disinterested
                            exertions to civilize <lb/>them. ALl to whom I have mentioned the
                            <lb/>contents and letter express great satisfaction in <lb/>the same. It
                            is particularly wished that the <lb/>friends might obtain a footing and
                            an influence <lb/>amongst the Indians, as their precepts and exam-
                            <lb/>ples are powerfully, pointed against the <lb/>characteristic and
                            predominent Indian vices — <lb/>idleness — intemperence — and war</p>
                        <p> Of all Christian denominations you appear <lb/>to understand the right
                            method of accomplishing <lb/>the object long wished for and sought by
                            pious <lb/>people towards the Indians and are going the right <lb/>way
                            to work, for it is an indubitable truth that <lb/>they must be civilized
                            by Agriculture &amp;c. before they <lb/>can be efficiently benefited in
                            their religion <lb/>or morals — I have a plan in my mind which <lb/>I
                            have long cherished, and am the more convinced <lb/>in its eligibility
                            since I have had an opportunity <lb/>to become acquainted with the
                            Indians in this <lb/>Country — extending perhaps a little beyond what
                            you <lb/>may have contemplated, but substantially founded <lb/>on the
                            same principles, but which you appear to be <lb/>governed in your
                            efforts towards them, I will <lb/>take the liberty to make it known to

                            with<lb/>other chiefs and many more people assembled at a <lb/>funeral-
                            that a missionary preacher was there<lb/>whose name they had forgot-
                            that on making known<lb/>their errand and producing the address the
                            preacher<lb/>interfered and strongly urged the chiefs and people<lb/>not
                            to hearken to the Quakers nor accept any<lb/>thing from them, not even
                            the implements of<lb/>Husbandry offered by you as a present- that if<pb

                            no particular<lb/>answer from the chiefs at that time. But, it

                        <p>Who this preacher is, I know not. But who<lb/>ever he may be, I am sure
                            he ought never to<lb/>have been sent to the Indians, to act so
                            much<lb/>like a heathen himself, so contrary to the Gospel<lb/>of peace,

                            that<lb/>they would employ such men for christian<lb/>teachers- I hope
                            the clergy of New England are<lb/>not for Renewing the spirit of former

                        <p>We, the Committee on Indian Concerns, inform, that since our<lb/>last
                            report we have, agreeably to the liberty given us, published
                            <lb/>narrative of our proceedings, which has been distributed
                            amongst<lb/>Friends. We further inform, that a letter has been received
                            from<lb/>the Indian agent at <placeName key="fwayn"
                                >Fort-Wayne</placeName>, dated <date when="1805-10-05">the Fifth of
                                the Tenth<lb/>month, 1805</date>, in which he says, <lb/>Agreeably
                            to the directions of the Committee, I have employ-<lb/>ed a man to
                            assist the Indians in cultivating the field on the <geogName key="wabas"
                                >Wa-<lb/>bash</geogName>, which was cleared and cultivated by
                                <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName> last<lb/>year. The
                            Indians, with this man’s assistance, have raised, it is<lb/>supposed, at
                            least six-hundred bushels of good Corn from this<lb/>field, exclusive of
                            what they have raised from the ground of their own<lb/>clearing. Many of
                            the <orgName key="eel">Eel River</orgName> and <orgName key="wea"
                                >Weas</orgName> Indians have removed<lb/>and settled at that place,
                            where they will be followed by the<lb/>younger branches of their tribes
                            in the ensuing spring.</p>
                        <p>He adds, <said who="undetermined">Believing as I do, that the Society of
                                Friends are<lb/>desirous of ameliorating the situation of their red
                                brethren in this<lb/>country, I will take the liberty to observe,
                                that the present is a<lb/>very favourable time to put in execution,
                                their benevolent views,<lb/>and that much good may be done on the
                                    <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> by sending one<lb/>or
                                two suitable men to reside amongst the Indians, in order
                                to<lb/>teach them how to raise stock and cultivate the earth:
                                Witness<lb/>what <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>
                                effected amongst them the last year. At a<lb/>Station where he had
                                every thing to begin, there are now at<lb/>least four hundred Hogs
                                and twenty Cows, and at no village in<lb/>this country, do the
                                Indians live as comfortably as at that place.<lb/>If this spirit of
                                industry is kept alive for a few years, it will cer-<lb/>tainly have
                                a powerful influence upon the minds of the Indians, at<lb/>many of
                                the neighboring villages.</said></p>
                        <p>The Committee, after deliberate consideration, were united in
                            senti-<lb/>ment, that it would be proper to procure one or two young men
                            to re-<lb/>side among the Indians at <placeName key="denn">Dennis’s
                                Station</placeName>. <persName key="wkirk1">William Kirk</persName>
                            and his bro-<lb/>ther <persName key="mkirk1">Mahlon</persName> were
                            accordingly engaged, who arrived at the station on<lb/>the <date
                                when="1806-04-25">25th of the Fourth Month last</date>. William has
                            just returned, having<lb/>left his brother among the Indians, and has
                            given us the following in-<lb/>formation: That they had planted twelve
                            acres of Indian corn, <lb/>on the land already cleared; after which they
                            enclosed eight acres<lb/>more; in six of which they cultivated Potatoes,
                            Hemp, Flax,<lb/>Tobacco and Timothy, together with a variety of Garden
                            Vege-<lb/>tables; that their crop of Corn, was likely to produce, at
                            least fif-<lb/>ty bushels per acre; and that they should have one
                            hundred bush-<lb/>els of Potatoes, and many more Garden Vegetables than
                            would be<lb/>sufficient for their own use, which would be distributed
                            amongst<lb/>the Indians; they have also erected a stable, 16 by 18 feet,
                            and<lb/>assisted the Indians in building three houses. He further
                            informs,<pb n="142" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_139"/><lb/>that half a mile below the Station, is a
                            village, where they found<lb/>fourteen families of the <orgName
                                key="eel">Eel River Indians</orgName>, which has this
                            summer,<lb/>been increased by several families and many more are
                            expected<lb/>this fall; That these Indians have raised a good crop of
                            Corn, and<lb/>have several Horses, Cows, and many Hogs. Another village
                            of<lb/>twenty families, of the <orgName key="miami">Miamis</orgName>, is
                            settled about a half mile above<lb/>the Station. These have also raised
                            a good crop of Corn, and<lb/>have several Horses and Cattle, and at
                            least on hundred Hogs.<lb/>At both of those villages their Corn was
                            planted by white people,<lb/>employed by the Indian agent, who, with
                            their consent, deducts the<lb/>expence out of their annuities. After the
                            Corn was planted, they<lb/>cultivated themselves.</p>
                        <p>Adjacent to the <placeName key="denn">Station</placeName>, several
                            families of <orgName key="wea">Weas Indians</orgName> are<lb/>settled,
                            who have cleared six acres of land. The family with<lb/>which <persName
                                key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName> resided, being one of them.
                            This six acres,<lb/>together with part of what Philip Dennis cleared,
                            which was not<lb/>cultivated by <persName key="wkirk1"
                                >William</persName> and <persName key="mkirk1">Mahlon
                                Kirk</persName>, they have themselves cul-<lb/>tivated in Corn,
                            except one plowing given it by William Kirk.<lb/>From this ground
                            William expects they will have from sixty to<lb/>seventy bushels per
                            acre. The young Indian who worked with<lb/>Philip Dennis, has a good
                            sock of Cattle, and about four hundred<lb/>hogs.</p>
                        <p><persName key="wkirk1">William</persName> further observes, that he
                            visited several of the Indian<lb/>villages in that country, the Indians,
                            at most of which, were anxious<lb/>to engage in the cultivation of their
                            lands, and very solicitous<lb/>that aid should be extended to them by
                            Friends; but he uniform-<lb/>ly replied to them that Friends had it not
                            in their power to aid<lb/>more settlements than the one at present under
                            their care. He<lb/>also informs, that the progress made by the Indians
                            in civilization<lb/>surpasses any thing that could have been expected in
                            so short a<lb/>time. There are, nevertheless, many amongst them, who
                            have no<lb/>disposition to labour.</p>
                        <p>The Indian agent and all the other officers of government, have<lb/>been
                            very kind, and have done all in their power to make their
                            situa-<lb/>tion comfortable. The young Indian who distinguished himself
                            by<lb/> working with <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>,
                            gave them twenty Bushels of Corn and<lb/>some Hogs in return for the
                            benefits received from the Friends last year.<lb/>Some of almost all the
                            tribes residing within sixty miles of the sta-<lb/>tion, have visited

                            been very friendly and well disposed. He further<lb/>says, that he

                                    this<lb/>country; for hen I returned home I explained faithfully
                                    to them<lb/>all that you requested.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>All you have said to us at and since that period,
                                    has been com-<lb/>municated to your red brothers of this
                                    country, which has caused<lb/>them to believe that you are their
                                    friends, and wish to relieve them<lb/>as far as lays in your
                                    power.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>Two springs ago you made your appearance here
                                    amongst us, <lb/>and said it pleased the Great Spirit that you
                                    should visit us;<lb/>which visit is gratefully acknowledged by
                                    your red brethren in this<lb/>country.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>You told us at that time you came to give us all
                                    the assistance<lb/>in your power, and requested us to point out
                                    a place where we<lb/>thought your services would be of most
                                    benefit to us; we request-<lb/>ed you to go to the place where
                                    our friend <persName key="wkirk1">William Kirk</persName>, who
                                    is<lb/>now present, has resided this summer; this place we chose
                                    be-<lb/>cause it was the most public, and would afford
                                    passengers an op-<lb/>portunity of seeing what was done more
                                    than any other we could<lb/>point out. You then raised a great
                                    crop of Corn and gave it to<lb/>your red brethren; the receipt
                                    of which was thankfully acknow-<lb/>ledged by them.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>You have now again made your appearance amongst
                                    your red<lb/>brethren in this country; they have listened to
                                    your words with<lb/>attention, and find they correspond with the
                                    first words you spoke<lb/>to us. You told us you came to occupy
                                    the same ground that you<lb/>had occupied two years ago, but did
                                    not request us to point out<lb/>to you at what place your
                                    services would be most beneficial, as<lb/>you did when you first
                                    arrived amongst us, which has prevented<lb/>your red brethren,
                                    residing elsewhere, from participating in your services</p>
                                <pb n="143" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_140"/>
                                <p>Brothers, <lb/>We believe your intentions towards your red
                                    brethren<lb/>are good, for which we are thankful to you; we hope
                                    that<lb/>the Great Spirit will continue it in your hearts, to
                                    relieve<lb/>your red brethren, who are at this time much in want
                                    of your<lb/>aid.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>We received with pleasure the implements of
                                    husbandry<lb/> you sent us; we have endeavoured to use them but
                                    we have not<lb/> been able to make right use of them, for want
                                    of some person<lb/>to teach us how they are used.</p>
                                <p>Brothers,<lb/>You are come amongst us as it were this morning,
                                    the sun has<lb/>not yet risen to 12 o’clock; you have not stayed
                                    all night with us.<lb/>The families you have visited amongst us,
                                    are well pleased with<lb/>you, and confidently receive you as
                                    their brothers: we therefore,<lb/>hope you will continue amongst
                                    us, as we believe our attachment<lb/>will increase with the time
                                    you are with us.</p>

                        <p>The committee have lately received another letter from<lb/>the Indian
                            agent, in which he says <said who="undetermined">that the Indians<lb/>at
                                    <placeName key="denn">Dennis’s Station</placeName>, as well as
                                those at the <placeName key="lturtown">Little Turtle’s
                                    Town</placeName>,<lb/>eighteen miles north of Dennis’s Station,
                                are advancing towards<lb/>civilization, exceeding all that could
                                have been expected.</said></p>
                        <p>We have examined the treasurer’s accompts, and find in his hands<lb/>219
                            dollars and 41 cents.<lb/>The committee, in concluding their report, are
                            free to observe,<lb/>that upon a review of the progress made towards the
                            accomplish-<lb/>ment of the object of their appointment, there appears
                            to be great<lb/>cause of encouragement for Friends to persevere in this
                            truly lauda-<lb/>ble and interesting concern, which has prospered,
                            beyond the expec-<lb/>tations of Friends, at the time they first engaged
                            in the undertak-<lb/>ing: and clearly demonstrates to the discerning
                            mind, that it<lb/>hath indeed been divinely owned; and no discouragement
                            or ob-<lb/>straction now appearing, but the want of funds, the
                            committee<lb/>affectionately address themselves to the feelings of
                            Friends. They<lb/>deem it not improper to remind them that the soil,
                            from which,<lb/>through the mercy and goodness of Divine Providence, we
                            derive<lb/>so many comforts and blessings, was once the inheritance of
                            this<lb/>people. A small part of the abundance with which we are
                            blessed<lb/>would, if rightly applied at the present time, be the means
                            of ad-<lb/>ministering great comfort and advantage to them; and it is
                            all-<lb/>important, that the present favourable crisis should be
                            improved:<lb/>for if an opinion were to obtain amongst them, that
                            Friends are<lb/>withdrawing their aid, they may become discouraged, and
                            return<lb/>to their former mode of living for support, and thereby
                            again<lb/>become plunged into that poverty and wretchedness, from
                            which,<lb/>by the aid of the Friends, they are just emerging. The
                            committee,<lb/>therefore fell themselves warranted in saying, that they
                            believe, the<lb/>very existence of nations may depend upon the part we
                            now act in<lb/>this business; they also consider, that the reputation of
                            society is<lb/>deeply interested in the active prosecution of the
                            concern; and<lb/>feel an earnest desire, that if the meeting should see
                            it right to<lb/>continue them, Friends may be stimulated to more
                            liberality, as it<lb/>is altogether impracticable for the committee to
                            continue their ex-<lb/>ertions without the aid of additional funds. </p>

                            the<lb/>effect produced, by the present liberal and<lb/>christian effort
                            to civilize them;- for should<lb/>this attempt not succeed, the failure
                            may be<lb/>discouraging not only to the Government but<lb/>to the
                            Indians themselves, and they turn their<lb/>attention altogether from
                            the cultivation<lb/>of their lands- Should this be the case,
                            &amp;<lb/>the Indians continue in their present wandering<lb/>habits,
                            and disposition of mind, it must inevitably<lb/>lead, to the entire
                            annihilation of their race<lb/>in a few centuries: Whilst on the other
                            hand<lb/>the committee entertain no doubt, but a judi<lb/>cious
                            administration of the powers with<lb/>which thou art entrusted, would in
                            a little<lb/>time draw their attention from their present<lb/>mode of
                            living, and fix them in habits,<lb/>which would not only secure to them
                            all<lb/>the necessary comforts, but be the means of<lb/>perpetuating
                            their existence as a people, and<lb/>securing their attachment to the
                            Govern<lb/>ment of the United States. Under this<lb/>consideration of
                            the subject, the committee<lb/>have been led to view thy situation as
                            a<lb/>highly responsible and important one,<lb/>the great confidence
                            reposed in thee has<pb n="152" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_151"/><lb/>certainly a strong claim upon thy
                            utmost<lb/>zeal, and the committee earnestly hope, that<lb/>the
                            philanthropic views of the government<lb/>will not be frustrated, by any
                            want of an<lb/>active, faithful and concientious discharge<lb/>of thy
                            duty</p>
                        <p>At this distance from the scene<lb/>of thy labours, it cannot be expected
                            that<lb/>the committee should enter into a minute<lb/>detail of the
                            course it would be proper for<lb/>thee to pursue, but there are certain
                            general<lb/>principles which obviously &amp; indispensably<lb/>should
                            pervade all the operations: In the<lb/>first place and above all things,
                            the com<lb/>mittee affectionately exhort thee to a frequent<lb/>and
                            humble recurence, to that divine and<lb/>preserving power which the
                            great Lord and<lb/>Master has declared is sufficient for us, and under
                            the<lb/>influence of which, if we steadily &amp;faithfully<lb/>abide, we
                            may safely travel along through<lb/>every difficulty and every trial</p>
                        <p>The Government manifests a <lb/>disinterested, liberal and benevolent
                            policy<lb/>toward the Indians, and the committee<lb/>strongly desire
                            that the same disinterestedness <lb/>may be manifested by thee and that
                            thou<lb/>mayest in all thy movements be preserved<lb/>from any views of
                            pecuniary emolument <pb n="153" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_152"/><lb/>beyond the liberal salary allowed
                            thee, being<lb/>influenced in thy conduct,<lb/>solely by a desire to
                            promote their<lb/>comfort and welfare- To relieve the wants<lb/>and be
                            instrumental in promoting the comfort of<lb/>so many thousands of our
                            fellow creatures<lb/>must of itself administer sufficient reward<lb/>to
                            a feeling mind. Thou art not uninformed<lb/>that much injury and great
                            injustice have been<lb/>done these people, the present government
                            of<lb/>the United States, shows every disposition to<lb/>conduct itself
                            with Humanity and justice<lb/>towards them, and we do believe is
                            disposed, to<lb/>do every thing in its power to discharge
                            the<lb/>obligations due from our country to them-<lb/>Thy duty will be
                            faithfully to carry into exe<lb/>cution its views</p>
                        <p>The work unavoidably must be<lb/>gradual in its progress
                            early<lb/>prejudices and fixed habits are not easily era<lb/>dicated,
                            every nation being strongly attached<lb/>to the manners and customs of
                            its ancestors<lb/>we therefore find that great national changes<lb/>have
                            always been effected slowly, and thou<lb/>must not expect, that the
                            Indians will gene<lb/>rally fall in with thy views until they
                            become<lb/>fully convinced, that the change proposed<pb n="154"
                                facs="SW_BYM_minutes_153"/><lb/>will promote their advantage; the committee<lb/>therefore advise
                            thee not to undertake too<lb/>much at first, but commence thy
                            operations<lb/>on a small scale; thou will recollect, that<lb/>thy
                            business is not to raise food for the Indi<lb/>ans, without being
                            assisted by them, this would<lb/>only be to encourage them in idleness,
                            but<lb/>the object of thy appointment, is, to teach<lb/>them how to
                            provide the necessary comforts<lb/>for themselves, which can never be
                            done, but<lb/>by their consenting to aid in the cultivation<lb/>of their
                            lands, and gradually becoming accus<lb/>tomed to labour they will feel
                            the benefits<lb/>of it, and in time be altogether drawn<lb/>off from a
                            precarious dependence upon<lb/>fishing &amp; hunting for a support</p>
                        <p>It will be most prudent for thee, not<lb/>to urge the Indians too much to
                            receive thy<lb/>aid, but rather wait to be solicited by them;<lb/>in all
                            thy communications with them, thou<lb/>shouldest endeavour to impress
                            them with<lb/>a just idea, of the friendly disposition of the
                                <lb/><persName key="tjeff2">president of the United
                                States</persName> and <persName key="hdear1">Secretary<lb/>of

                            should be fully satisfied, the Government in<lb/>its present undertaking
                            is actuated solely by a<lb/>desire to benefit them, for we apprehend
                            that<lb/>the Traders residing amongst them being interested<pb n="155"
                                facs="SW_BYM_minutes_154"/><lb/>in keeping them in their present uncivilized<lb/>state will use
                            great efforts to counteract thy<lb/>exertions, and will throw every
                            obstacle they<lb/>can in the way of any plan that may be adopted<lb/>for
                            their civilization, they will also probably<lb/>endeavour to persuade
                            the Indians, that the<lb/>Government is now influenced by
                            some<lb/>interested motive, and if they can no other<lb/>way succeed in
                            rendering the present attempt<lb/>abortive, will even endeavour to
                            induce<lb/>them to abandon their present settlements<lb/>and remove
                            further to the westward. And<lb/>as these traders by living amongst
                            the<lb/>Indians and speaking their language, have<lb/>a great influence
                            over them, it will<lb/>require much circumspectiom and wisdom in thee
                            to<lb/>counteract this influence. Thou must be<lb/>cautious in thy
                            communications to them<lb/>and very particular in the selection of
                            interpret<lb/>ters- We apprehend it will rarely be safe<lb/>for thee to
                            make use of a trader for this purpose.</p>

                            last. It appears by <lb/>information from him, that his time

                            had an<lb/>opportunity of taking each other by the hands.</p>
                        <p>Brethren These Chiefs having in the course of their<lb/>journey seen how
                            much more comfortably the white<lb/>people lived than their Red
                            Brethren, were led to<lb/>inquire by what means they might on their
                            return to their<lb/>own Country be enabled to procure for their people
                            the<lb/>same comforts which they saw in the families here</p>
                        <p>Brethren Your brothers the quakers of <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName> in<lb/>a talk which they then had with them
                            explained to them<lb/>the means by which we obtained these things- we
                            told<lb/>them that it all came out of the grounds and that it<lb/>was by
                            cultivating our lands that we were enabled to got<lb/>them</p>
                        <p>Brothers These chiefs then told us that it was their<lb/>wish to obtain
                            for their Women &amp; children the same comforts<lb/>and that they would
                            on their return home turn their<lb/>attention to the cultivation of
                            their lands and for the<lb/>purpose of aiding you we procured and

                        <p>Brothers You afterwards informed us that you had rcd<lb/>these implements

                            country<lb/>to see your situation, and to give you such
                            instruction<lb/>as might be necessary</p>
                        <p>Brethren In consequence of this request and the<lb/>friendship which we
                            had for our Red Brethren we did<lb/>in the succeeding summer prevail on
                            some of our friends to make<lb/>you a visit and one of them remained
                            with you during<lb/>the season, to teach you the use of the tools we
                            take hold <lb/>of and put you in a way to provide for yourselves your
                            <lb/>women &amp;Children, the many necessaries they were in need of </p>
                        <p>Brethren It is now several years since we first took<lb/>each other by
                            the hands- we have during all this time<lb/>been endeavouring to draw
                            your attention to the cultiva<lb/>tion of your lands, and have several
                            summons sent<lb/>some of our friends to stay with you to give you
                            the<lb/>necessary instruction</p>
                        <p>Brethren when our friends first went into your<lb/>country they requested
                            such of your Cheifs as were<lb/>present to point out the most suitable
                            place to begin<lb/>the improvement these chiefs said it had better be
                            at<lb/>neither of their villages and after consulting together
                            fixed<lb/>on the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> and pointed out
                            a particular spot, which<lb/>they wished us to to commence the reasons
                            which they gave<lb/>for that being the most proper place was that the
                            river<lb/> was navigable and a public road passed by this place<lb/>on
                            the bank of it, it was of course the most public spot<lb/>they could
                            point out which had equal advantages of<lb/>soil and would afford many
                            of your your young men<lb/>as they passed by an opportunity of learning
                            from the<lb/>example set them, and accordingly the settlement
                            was<lb/>commenced and has been continued at that place<lb/>ever since:
                            it has been our intention after our Red<lb/>brethren who have removed to
                            reside at <placeName key="denn">Dennis station</placeName><lb/>shall
                            have become so advanced as to be able to proceed<lb/>without the aid of

                            consideration if they<lb/>wish us to extend assistance to any other
                            place &amp; if they<lb/>should conclude to request it leave them at
                            liberty<lb/>to propose such other spot as they may prefer.<pb n="177"

                        <p>Brethren As we have already told you so we again<lb/>repeat it, it is
                            only by the cultivation of your lands<lb/>and rearing of stock that you
                            can ever raise your<lb/>selves from the situation which you have
                            here<lb/>tofore been in. the white people find it necessary<lb/>to do so
                            in order to get food and cloathing for <lb/>themselves.</p>
                        <p>Brethren There are some amongst us who are<lb/>not industrious and will
                            not work these cannot<lb/>earn the comforts for themselves which
                            industrious<lb/>people do but are often in great distress and
                            poverty<lb/>so that we clearly see it is by industry that
                            a<lb/>comfortable living must be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Brethren We believe it right to employ our horses<lb/>and oxen in tilling
                            our lands, they are strong and<lb/>one of them can do more work in a day
                            than<lb/>many men. We believe that the good spirit gave<lb/>them to us
                            in order to help us in this way. you ought<lb/>therefore if you wish to
                            adopt our mode of living use<lb/>your horses &amp; oxen in ploughing and
                            other work which<lb/>they can do</p>
                        <p>Brethren listen we have never felt any sentiment<lb/>but friendship for
                            of course are not afraid to speak<lb/>to you as brethren who love each
                            other ought to do.<lb/>Therefore we now tell you that we believe
                            Whiskey<lb/>to be one of the greatest evils which the Bad Spirit<lb/>has
                            introduced into the world it brings more misery<lb/>&amp; poverty along
                            with it than any other thing that has<lb/>ever been found in this
                            Country</p>
                        <p>Brethren We intreat you not to suffer any of this<lb/>Poison to be
                            brought to your towns you have seen the<lb/>effect of it and must know
                            its destructive consequences<lb/>Whiskey not only corrupts the minds of
                            those that<lb/>drink it but also occasions great poverty &amp; distress
                            in<lb/>the families of those men who get drunk because it<lb/>destroys
                            their reason and disqualifies them for work <pb n="178" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_177"/><lb/>It has
                            this effect upon the white people who drink<lb/>it and will have the
                            same effect upon you</p>
                        <p>Brethren we believe that the good Spirit<lb/>placed all men on this earth
                            as brothers and that<lb/>it is their duty to do all the good they can to
                            each<lb/>other it is altogether on the ground that we are
                            made<lb/>willing to contribute a part of what we have obtained<lb/>by
                            our industry in order to assist our Red Brothers<lb/>it is this that has
                            made us anxious to convince you<lb/>that you would be much happier if
                            you would lay<lb/>aside your present mode of living and adopt
                            the<lb/>more certain and less laborious mode of living by<lb/>the
                            cultivation of the earth</p>
                        <p>Brethren we always told you that in sending<lb/>our young men into your
                            country to show you how<lb/>to use the tools which your chiefs saw in
                            the Lands<lb/>of the white people we did not seek our advantage<lb/>we
                            now again give you this assurance and hope<lb/>you will be convinced
                            that in doing it never had<lb/>any object in view but your own good</p>
                        <p>Brethren It is our desire that you will keep<lb/>this paper which we now
                            send you as a document<lb/>in your hands that we have no claim on you
                            or<lb/>your children who may come after you for our<lb/>services and
                            will never ask any lands or other<lb/>rewards from you or

                    annuities, and a few of them<lb/>by their own labour. But the insatiable
                    desire<lb/>these people have for spirituous liquors, and the<lb/>quantity they

                                since<lb/>you sent these people amongst us. I repeat<lb/>they have
                                not been so useful to us as I expected<lb/>yet I am not
                                dissatisfied- They generally<lb/>work a field by themselves beyond
                                our house<lb/>we are glad of the aid you have offered us, But
                                <lb/>would be better pleased if you would extend<lb/>your aid more
                                generally amongst us<lb/>My Brothers would then have reason to
                                be<lb/>glad as well as myself. You have told us<lb/>that these
                                people you have sent amongst us<lb/>would aid &amp; assist us. This
                                is an evidence of the<lb/>good you wish to do for us &amp; it is a
                                misfortune<lb/>among your red Brethren that they are not all<lb/>of
                                one sentiment on this subject. we are very glad<lb/>of the aid that
                                you have sent us, we would rather<lb/>the young men you send us
                                would aid us in our<lb/>own fields they would be of more service to
                                us<lb/>in this way. It also has been said amongst us<lb/>when our
                                Brethren wish to withdraw from us<lb/>altogether, who is to take
                                possession of their<lb/>improvements they are not sufficient for us
                                all <pb n="187" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_186"/><lb/>last year the young men you sent raised a
                                fine<lb/>crop of corn. We were glad when we were going<lb/>home to
                                hear them say it should be divided<lb/>among us, this was very
                                pleasing to us I<lb/>thanked you in my heart for the aid you<lb/>had
                                intended to our people. some days after<lb/>this we were informed
                                that our Brothers inten<lb/>ded to gather the corn and put it up in
                                a crib, we<lb/>then understood that the corn would be put
                                up<lb/>&amp; reserved for us until spring when it would be<lb/>of
                                more use, That our brothers would return<lb/>and divide it among us
                                this When <persName key="jshaw1">John Shaw</persName><lb/>arrived he
                                told us that when our people were<lb/>in need of corn to come down
                                &amp; get it. I told<lb/>J Shaw that the Indians considered the corn
                                as<lb/>given to them last fall &amp; that they would not<lb/>be so
                                well satisfied as if the Indians were<lb/>assembled &amp; it was
                                given to them all at once<lb/>I then told him not to divide it in
                                the way<lb/>he proposed but to let it remain until the
                                arrival<lb/>of <persName key="wwell1">Wm Wells</persName>. Shaw
                                observed that what I said was<lb/>true but that he thought a number
                                might suffer<lb/>for want of it during the absence of Wm Wells &amp;
                                that<lb/>the said Wm Wells had requested him to lend him<lb/>some of
                                the corn, When Friends &amp; Wm Wells came &amp; went <pb n="188"
                                    facs="SW_BYM_minutes_187"/><lb/>away again. I was to that the corn was all gone<lb/>when my
                                people went down to receive the corn<lb/>they found it had almost
                                all been removed<lb/>I then told the people not to receive it as
                                there<lb/>would not be enough for them all- I am high<lb/>ly pleased
                                to see you in this Country. You ex<lb/>pected to find your young men
                                working in<lb/>our fields, instead of which you found
                                them<lb/>working in a field by themselves, we would<lb/>like it much
                                better if they would work in<lb/>our fields- The Chiefs not being
                                present I<lb/>do not find myself authorised to say any<lb/>thing

                <p><persName key="etyso1">Elisha Tyson</persName> then observed that they
                    appeared<lb/>desirous of receiving further assistance, &amp; that<lb/> to extend
                    more than one place. We told<lb/>your Chiefs when in <placeName key="balti1"
                        >Baltimore</placeName> that we could<lb/>not assist them at more than one
                    place at a <lb/>time, that we were poor but their father the<lb/>President was
                    rich &amp; able to help them, and<lb/>we had learned that he had promised
                    them<lb/>his aid &amp; we cannot understand why the young<lb/>men with their
                    tools which their father had<lb/>sent were turned back when the expense
                    was<lb/>nothing to the Indians yet it cost your father <pb n="189" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_188"/><lb/>the
                    President much money. When your gen<lb/>eral council meets we shall expect an
                    answer<lb/>to all we have said &amp; particularly to the<lb/>address of the
                    committee herewith handed &amp;<lb/>deposited with <persName key="wwell1">Wm

                        >Wabash</geogName> must have time to raise corn for them<lb/>selves &amp;
                    their horses. Whilst at work they have<lb/>had a house to raise &amp; other work
                    to do &amp; have<lb/>not had time hitherto to raise more than was<lb/>sufficient
                    for their own use &amp; that the surplus<lb/>shall always be given to the
                    Indians &amp; not<lb/>sold. The object of our young men in coming to<lb/>your
                    country was to learn you to work &amp; not to<lb/>raise corn for themselves. The
                    young men have<lb/>put away as much of the corn only as was suf<lb/>ficient for
                    their own support, the balance will<lb/>be delivered to the Indians at any time
                    they<lb/>want it. When your Chiefs were at <placeName key="balti1"
                        >Baltimore</placeName><lb/>they informed us that they walked in the
                    thorny<lb/>path and wished to walk after us, We want them<lb/>to do as we do, to
                    accustom their children to work<lb/>when young &amp; this is the way to walk in
                    the path <lb/>which we have walked in<lb/>after which the council adjourned</p>

                <p>It appearing to be he united judgment<lb/>of the committee that but little
                    permanent<lb/>advantage will likely to result to the <lb/>Indians from the aid
                    furnished them by<lb/>Friends whilst they have access to spirituous<lb/>liquors,

                            which they<lb/>had previous to their leaving that place<lb/>secured in a

                            when a<lb/>particular reply he said would be made. They<lb/>likewise

                <p>At a Meeting of the Committee on Indian<lb/>concerns present 11 Members</p>
                <p>The committee appointed to enquire into the<lb/>situation &amp; disposition of
                    that portion of the <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName><lb/>Tribe of

                        >Mohicken<lb/>John</geogName>, reported that they had ascertained the
                    Title<lb/>of the these Indians, to the 13 sections of Land reserved<lb/>for
                    their use by a law of Congress, was good, so long<lb/>as they may continue to
                    occupy &amp;cultivate the<lb/>same; They further reported, that part of their
                    num<lb/>ber had had a conference with some of them, &amp;<lb/>that their
                    suffering situation claims our sympathy.<lb/>It appeared they were desirous to
                    receive aid form<lb/>Friends, and disposed to cultivate their Lands;
                    the<lb/>white people having began to form settlements<lb/>beyond them, they will
                    in a little time be precluded<lb/>from obtaining a living as heretofore by

                    remained there until about the middle of<lb/>last month, during which time they
                    had raised a<lb/>crop of good corn, of between 5&amp;600 Bushels, which <pb
                        n="203" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_202"/><lb/>was carefully secured before they came away, they<lb/>also
                    raised some Hemp, Tobacco, Potatoes, Turnips &amp;a<lb/>variety of Garden
                    Vegetables. The corn was not dis<lb/>tributed amongst the Indians this fall, on
                    acct.<lb/>of many of them being absent, on Hunting expi<lb/>ditions, &amp; their
                    believing it would be more<lb/>serviceable in the spring; He likewise informed,
                    <lb/>that they had aided the Indians in building<lb/>several Houses, after the
                    crop was in a situation<lb/>to admit of their attention being withdrawn<lb/>from
                    it, and that some of the Indians appeared<lb/>industrious and worked steadily,
                    but the corrupting<lb/>and debasing influence of Spiritous liquors upon
                    them,<lb/>which most pernicious article, they continue to<lb/>introduce in large
                    quantities into their Villages<lb/>remains to be the principal obstacle to their
                    ge<lb/>neral improvement; and if means are not adopted,<lb/>to prevent their

                    appear<lb/>a very encouraging prospect of their progressing<lb/>much in

                            The conference which<lb/>we then had, has been strongly impressed upon
                            my<lb/>mind; I have often remembered our communications,<lb/>and

                            in the knowledge<lb/>of some of the more useful arts of civil life.</p>
                        <p>Brothers <lb/><persName key="lturt1">The Turtle</persName> no doubt

                        <p>Brothers<lb/>In consequence of the expectations<lb/>then made, a law was
                            passed, empowering the<lb/><persName key="tjeff2">President of the
                                United States</persName> to restrain the traders<lb/>from furnishing

                            the opinion, that<lb/>while it was so freely used amongst our red
                            Brethren<lb/>it would be a considerable obstruction to
                            their<lb/>improvement. As soon as that difficulty seemd<lb/>to be
                            removed, we apprehended it was time<lb/>for us to take some steps
                            towards carrying the<lb/>concern of our religious society into effect,
                            and<lb/>as we were not fully acquainted with the situ<lb/>ation of of

                            Country, where<lb/>they had a conference with divers of the chiefs of
                            our <pb n="206" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_205"/><lb/>red brethren, and a situated was pointed
                            out<lb/>where we should commence our operations &amp;<lb/>make an
                            establishment, for it appeared to us<lb/>that the most effectual way of
                            carrying our views<lb/>into execution, was to begin our efforts at
                            particular<lb/>spot, and it was then our contention that when<lb/>our
                            red brethren should become sufficiently<lb/>instructed at that place,
                            (so as to be able to<lb/>do without our assistance) to remove to
                            some<lb/>other village in order to continue our aid</p>
                        <p>Brothers! From the report of those who were<lb/>appointed by the society
                            to carry on our ope<lb/>rations on the <geogName key="wabas"
                                >Wabash</geogName>, it has never appeard to<lb/>us, that the time
                            was yet come, in which it<lb/>would be proper for our young men to
                            desert<lb/>that establishment, and go to any other place. It<lb/>may not
                            be best to withhold from our red brothers<lb/>that the society has met
                            with considerable dis<lb/>couragments on being informed, that
                            notwithstanding<lb/> the benevolent measures of the Government in
                            order<lb/>to prevent the introduction of spiritous liquors<lb/>amongst
                            the Indians, some of them, go amongst<lb/>the white people and bring to
                            their villages large<lb/>supplies of them, this information induced us
                            to<lb/>write to our red brethren, and inform them of<lb/>the
                            discouragments we were under, and to endeavor<lb/>to impress upon their
                            minds, the necessity there was<lb/>for all those, who desire to make
                            improvements in<lb/>agriculture and other useful arts of civil life,
                            to<lb/>decline the use of spiritous liquors, but we have been <pb

                            communicating<lb/>had not reached the Chiefs, before the
                            commencement<lb/>of their general council, they had themselves
                            taken<lb/>the subject into consideration, and addressed a<lb/>petition
                            to the <persName key="tjeff2">President of the United
                            States</persName><lb/>desiring that the people of the State of

                            the<lb/>Indians. This would have operated as an<lb/>encouragement to us,
                            to persevere in the busi<lb/>ness which we had undertaken, had we
                            not<lb/>been informed by a communication from<lb/><placeName key="fwayn"
                                >Fort Wayne</placeName>, being the proceedings of the

                            dispence with our further services- As this<lb/>is the situation of the
                            business at present when<lb/>we head of the arrival of our red brethren
                                in<lb/><placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> this day it was
                            pleasing to us for we<lb/>wished an opportunity of this sort with them,

                            And<lb/>I hope as we are now here met in council, we<lb/>may speak
                            freely, and that if our red brethren<lb/>should have met with any thing,
                            which has not<lb/>been to then satisfaction, in our intercourse
                            with<lb/>them, they would freely open to us their minds</p>
                        <p>Brothers! As our concern has led us to sympathise<lb/>with our red
                            brethren in different parts of this<lb/>Country, we have never found
                            ourselves confined <pb n="208" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_207"/><lb/>in our prospects, and if at any
                            time, any become<lb/>dissatisfied with us, we desire that they
                            would<lb/>freely commuicate to us their dissatisfaction, yet<lb/>tho' we
                            are sensible our motives are pure, having<lb/>no prospect of reaping any
                            advantages to ourselves,<lb/>in the prosecution of this concern, but
                            that<lb/>peace of mind, which will ever be the attendant<lb/>upon every
                            act of benevolence, our red brothers<lb/>must no doubt see, that after
                            having had our<lb/>minds exercised on their accounts, and
                            seen<lb/>engaged in endeavours to promote their benefit<lb/>so long in
                            their past of the continent, it would<lb/>be a disagreeable circumstance
                            to us, to seperate<lb/>ourselves from them; but if they are
                            dissatisfied,<lb/>and wish us to withdraw, from them, we shall<lb/>turn
                            our attention to some other quarter of <lb/>the country, in which our
                            red brothers reside. As<lb/>the concern has arisen from pure love in
                            our<lb/>hearts, flowing towards the red people, it does not<lb/>appear,
                            that we can give over our exertions, wen<lb/>if discouragements are
                            thrown in our way, but if<lb/>we are rejected in one place we shall turn
                            to<lb/>those who are willing to receive us, we now therefore<lb/>wish
                            our brothers to use that freedom, which one<lb/>brother ought to use to
                            another, in communiting <lb/>without reserve their sentiments to us</p>

                        <p>In rising to salute you, I<lb/>feel happy, &amp; thank the great spirit
                            who has put it<lb/>into our power, to take each other by the

                                facs="SW_BYM_minutes_208"/><lb/>and nothing bad</p>
                        <p>Brothers! This is not the first time that I have<lb/>heard you speak as
                            you now speak; when you<lb/>spoke these words to us some years ago we
                            then<lb/>answered you</p>
                        <p>Brothers! when you first spoke to us you<lb/>pointed to us the deplorable
                            situation of our<lb/>people, in a striking manner. you
                            enumerated<lb/>these great evils which were amongst us,<lb/>amongst
                            others, you mentioned that of spiritous<lb/>liquors which daily destroys
                            us</p>
                        <p>Brothers! we believed at that time, that you<lb/>were perfectly sensible
                            of our situation. we told<lb/>you that the evils that existed amongst
                            us<lb/>occasioned by strong drink, were too heavy for us to<lb/>remove,
                            and we told you that if you really<lb/>were concerned, as we believed
                            you to be, in<lb/>wishing us well, you would assist us in
                            geting<lb/>clear of this great evil</p>
                        <p>Brothers! we told you, that we could not<lb/>restrain our young men from
                            drinking spiritous<lb/>liquors, but that we believed, that as the
                            white<lb/>people were the makers of this great evil, they<lb/>could keep
                            it out of the way of our people, so<lb/>that they could get none</p>
                        <p>Brothers! You say that you went with us to<lb/>the seat of Government and
                            that a stop was<lb/>put to the introduction of liquor amongst us<lb/>as
                            we wished. But brothers I have never seen this<lb/>except in the
                            neighbourhood of <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>;
                            there<lb/>only our young men have not been able to get <pb n="210"
                                facs="SW_BYM_minutes_209"/><lb/>supplied with liquor. They get supplies <lb/>from the mouth of

                                >Wabash</geogName> and up that river: and there<lb/>is no place

                        <p>Brothers! You have now asked us if we<lb/>had any cause of complaint
                            against you<lb/>in the execution of the endeavours you have<lb/>and to
                            render us service, our answer to this is<lb/>that we have none. I must
                            now tell you, as<lb/>I before told you, when I talked with you,
                            <lb/>that there were various opinions amongst us<lb/>respecting the
                            advantages which you had offered<lb/>to us. Brothers we have no
                            complaint to make<lb/>against you, or any thing that you have
                            done<lb/>for us: we are not dissatisfied with you, but<lb/>if any thing
                            has gone wrong, and your good<lb/>intentions towards us have been
                            thwarted, it has<lb/>been owing to the conduct of those amongst us,
                            who<lb/>wish to continue us, in our present situation, &amp;<lb/>prevent
                            you from doing those good things which<lb/>you wish to do for us</p>
                        <p>Brothers! You have told us to speak freely,<lb/>we do so, what I now say
                            comes from my heart. Your<lb/>red brethren the Indians love you: It is
                            true some<lb/>of them have said that they were willing to
                            dispense<lb/>with your services, but this is not the
                            unannimous<lb/>opinion of your red brethren; Those who have
                            said<lb/>this have never received any services from you.- as<lb/>they
                            have recd. none, consequently they have none to <pb n="211"
                                facs="SW_BYM_minutes_210"/><lb/>dispense with. I am not now prepared to say<lb/>anything more to
                            you, but shall carry home<lb/>to my people all that you have said to
                            us</p>

                        <p>Since the first time we took each other by the<lb/>hand several years
                            ago, we have always felt a<lb/>strong solicitude for the welfare of our
                            red brethren<lb/>and an ardent desire to render them every
                            assistance<lb/>in our power.</p>
                        <p>Brother! It is this disposition towards them, which<lb/>has led us into
                            their country, and we have every<lb/>year since that time kept some
                            persons employed to<lb/>instruct them in those things which we
                            apprehended<lb/>would promote their comfort &amp; improvement</p>
                        <p>Brother! we have already informed them, that<lb/>our means are not great,
                            and that we have never<lb/>found ourselves in a situation to extend our
                            opera<lb/>tions to more than one Village at a time</p>
                        <p>Brother! It was by the agreement of our red<lb/>brethren that we
                            commenced our operations on<lb/>the <geogName key="wabas"
                                >Wabash</geogName>- and they have been informed that <pb n="217"

                        <p>Brother! As soon as we believed the time was<lb/>approaching, when the
                            situation of our brothers<lb/>there, would admit of our extending
                            assistance to<lb/>some other place, we turned our views to

                            of one another has increased, our love for<lb/>each other has been
                            strengthened</p>
                        <p>Brother! They have signified to us, that they<lb/>are greatly thankful
                            for the aid we have given<lb/>them, and they earnestly intreat us not to
                            with<lb/>draw from them, we must therefore still continue<lb/>to render
                            them some help, until they become<lb/>stronger &amp; better able to help
                            themselves</p>

                            have<lb/>now got a large piece of ground cleared &amp; under<lb/>fences,

                            to build him a mill, and as we<lb/>feel great love for him, and a strong
                            disposition<lb/>to meet his wishes, as far as in our power, we<lb/>have

                            we can determine what kind of a one<lb/>can best be put up for him-
                            Perhaps there may<lb/>not be a place for a water mill; this we
                            will<lb/>enquire into</p>
                        <p>Brother! After we shall have made the necessary<lb/>examination, we will
                            then determine on the<lb/>kind of mill most proper, and inform our
                            Brother<lb/>thereof.</p>

                            is, that he will<lb/>preserve our brother, through the long journey
                            he<lb/>has before him, and return him safe to the bosom<lb/>of his

                            replyed as follows</p>
                        <p>My Brothers! The communication you have just<lb/>made to me is highly
                            pleasing, and I return you <lb/>my sincere thanks</p>
                        <p>Brothers! You observe that your brothers on the<lb/><geogName key="wabas"

                            them, notwithstanding attempts have<lb/>been made to prejudice you
                            against them, and the <pb n="219" facs="SW_BYM_minutes_218"/><lb/>discouragements which you have
                            had to encounter</p>
                        <p>Brothers! I believed the building of a mill was the<lb/>best thing you
                            can do for my people, I have therefore<lb/>asked it of you; I think it
                            will encourage them to<lb/>raise large crops of corn &amp; perhaps
                            wheat, and it will<lb/>certainly afford a great convenience to those
                            who<lb/>reside in the neighbourhood of my Village</p>
                        <p>Brothers! I cannot omit again expressing to you my<lb/>thanks- I shall

                            greatly<lb/>paralised every exertion for their improvement<lb/>were
                            unanimously of the opinion that it<lb/>became their duty to pay such

                            accordingly<lb/>presented the memorial of the Indians to

                            discouraged<lb/>them from extending much assistance the<lb/>present
                            year, they therefore cannot but rejoice<lb/>in the prospect which now

                        <p>The committee may further inform that<lb/> a considerable number of the
                            principal<lb/>cheifs of the different nations of Indians<lb/>bordering
                            on the United States passed through<lb/>this city during the last winter
                            amongst<lb/>these were several of the chiefs of those Tribes<lb/>with
                            whom we have had an acquaintance<lb/>and divers conferences took place
                            between us<lb/>and them on the general subject of our<lb/>concern. From
                            the information which they<lb/>gave us it appeard that a disposition is
                            pre<lb/>vailing amongst their people to turn their<lb/>attention towards
                            the cultivation of their<lb/>lands, and to establish themselves in
                            fixed<lb/>habitations, and we are strengthened in the<lb/>opinion that
                            as the great obstacle to their<lb/>improvement has we trust been removed
                            this<lb/>disposition will continue to gain ground amongst<lb/>them and
                            that notwithstanding we have had<lb/>many discouraging circumstances to

                            information, that from a change of cir-<lb/>cumstances which had taken
                            place among the Indians at the <placeName key="wabas"
                            >Wabash</placeName>,<lb/>it was not likely that any further endeavours
                            for their assistance could<lb/>be continued to advantage- and therefore,
                            after solidly considering the<lb/>subject, we were united in believing
                            that it would be best, at least for<lb/>a time, to discontinue our
                            efforts in their favour, under the hope, how-<lb/>ever, that the causes
                            which have led to this suspension, may only be<lb/>temporary, having, as
                            we have understood, been produced by the de-<lb/>lusive counsels of an

                        <p>The committee also inform, that having received information that

                            to turn their attention to agriculture, and appeared<lb/>desirous that
                            the assistance of Friends might be extended to them ; and,<lb/>as our
                            efforts on the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> were at present
                            suspended after atten-<lb/>tively considering the subject, it was judged
                            expedient to nominate<lb/>some of our number to make them a visit, and
                            though way has not yet<lb/>opened for that to be accomplished, the
                            committee feel free to observe,<lb/>that little or no loss has been
                            sustained ; as the minds of the Indians<lb/>in that quarter have been
                            too much agitated during the past summer,<lb/>(the delusive influence of
                            the person beforementioned having been also<lb/>attempted at this
                            settlement) to afford a prospect, that any instruction<lb/>or assistance
                            could have been introduced to advantage among them.<lb/>And it may be
                            proper here to mention, that government was informed<lb/>of our prospect
                            of affording assistance to these Indians, and expressed<lb/>entire
                            approbation.</p>
                        <p>The committee also appointed a part of their number to make a

                            visit has been paid to them<lb/>accordingly, to much satisfaction, we
                            have continued the deputation<lb/>to give them such further advice and
                            assistance, as their wants may<lb/>appear to require in the cultivation
                            of their lands.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the difficulties and discouragements the
                            committee<lb/>have had to encounter, they yet feel a lively hope, that

                        <p>Agreeably to the prospect held up in our last report, a
                            deputation<lb/>from our number have made a visit to the settlement at
                                <placeName key="wapak">Wapako-<lb/>netta</placeName>, and upon
                            confering with the Chiefs and others, found the manx-<lb/>iously
                            desirous to receive assistance from Friends ; and particularly<lb/>to be
                            aided in putting up a Grist and Saw Mill at their town.
                            Upon<lb/>examining the seat, it was found not to be so eligible as one
                            could<lb/>have been desired ; but, as it appeared to be the best in that
                            neighbour-<lb/>hood, it was finally concluded to erect a Grist and Saw
                            Mill there.<lb/>Workmen have accordingly been engaged, and are now
                            employed in<lb/>erecting them, under the personal superintendence of one
                            of our Com-<lb/>mittee, by whom we are informed, that it is expected
                            they will both be<lb/>completed in the course of the present season. We
                            may also inform,<lb/>that the accounts which have reached us from these
                            Indians, represent<lb/>them as generally industrious, and disposed to
                            cultivate their lands ;<lb/>divers of them having already been cleared
                            and in cultivation, as much<lb/>ground as furnishes an abundant
                            sufficiency of grain for the use of <lb/>their own families. And it is
                            hoped that when their Mills shall have<lb/>been completed, this
                            disposition will more generally spread amongst<lb/>them.</p>
                        <p>Another deputation from our Committee have also made a visit to<lb/>the

                                >Mohickon-John's Lake</placeName>. They found these In-<lb/>dians
                            industriously disposed, and earnestly desirous of receiving
                            some<lb/>assistance from Friends. They were accordingly furnished with
                            such<lb/>implements of husbandry as their situation appeared to require,
                            and a <lb/>young man of our Society, of exemplary habits, was procured,
                            who re-<lb/>sided several months with them, and assisted them in
                            preparing their<lb/>tools, and putting in their crops. Several of them
                            have learned to<lb/>plough their lands ; and it is hoped that the
                            assistance already furnish-<lb/>ed will be of essential service to
                            them.</p>

                            river, where a number<lb/>of Indian families from the neighbouring
                            villages removed,<lb/>for the purpose of being instructed in agriculture
                            a<lb/>considerable quantity of ground was cleared and put<lb/>into
                            cultivation, and most kinds of domestic animals<lb/>such as Horses,

                        <p>After several Years attention at this settlement,<lb/>finding that their
                            labours became greatly interrupted<lb/>and their views misrepresented by
                            an evil disposed<lb/>person who at that time resided with the Indians,
                            and had<lb/>acquired an extensive influence amongst them, the
                            com<lb/>mittee believed it right after addressing the Natives<lb/>on the
                            occasion &amp; explaining fully to them the situation<lb/>in which they
                            found themselves to withdraw for a time<lb/>from that place. Many of the
                            Indians seemed grateful for<lb/>the assistance they had received, and
                            although the establish<lb/>ment did not succeed to the extent which the
                            committee<lb/>had anticipated, yet it is believed that some
                            essential<lb/>advantages have resulted to the Indians there- They
                            have<lb/>been brought by experience to feel the benefits of
                            an<lb/>agricultural life; &amp; by the introduction of Cattle &amp;
                            Hogs<lb/>amongst them, to the rearing of which their country
                            is<lb/>peculiarly well adapted, their resources to obtain food<lb/>have
                            been increased; Many families have also been<lb/>provided with
                            comfortable Houses which has stimulated others<lb/>to endeavour to
                            obtain them also and their minds have<lb/>been generally excited to look
                            to the cultivation of the<lb/>earth for their support, and the committee
                            apprehend<lb/>that the time is perhaps not very distant when it
                            may<lb/>become right to resume their labours at that place</p>
                        <p>Applications having been frequently made<lb/>to the committee by the

                            earnestly<lb/>disposed to avail themselves of the assistance which is
                            given<lb/>them, and manifest a disposition to become industrious<lb/>the
                            committee indulge an expectation, that their efforts<lb/>here will
                            suceed. These people have now a considerable<lb/>quantity of land in
                            cultivation &amp; many of them raise<lb/>as much grain as is necessary
                            for the consumption of their<lb/>own families-They have also a
                            considerable number of<lb/>cattle Hogs &amp;c. The committee have
                            latterly also extended<lb/>some aid to two villages of the <orgName

                                key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogName>, and have the satisfaction to
                            believe<lb/>that an improvement is taking place amongst these</p>
                        <p>In attending to this service they have hitherto<lb/>embraced no other
                            objects than those connected with<lb/>the cultivation of the soil, and
                            the introduction of<lb/>some of the arts of civil life amongst the
                            Indians, yet<lb/>while these have been viewed as necessary
                            preliminaries<lb/>in the civilization of those people, the committee
                            have<lb/>not been unmindful of the importance of School learning<lb/>and
                            those considerations which relate to their religious<lb/>improvement but
                            have not yet thought it best to attempt<lb/>the introduction of Schools
                            amongst them</p>
                        <p>It may not be improper further to remark, that<lb/>after a number of
                            years of patient and assiduous labour<lb/>the committee are confirmed in
                            the opinion that the work<lb/>in which they are engaged will continue to
                            be an arduous<lb/>one and that much time and exertion will yet
                            be<lb/>neccesary to effect any extensive or permanent change<lb/>amongst
                            the Indian Natives. Long established habits are<lb/>no where easily
                            eradicated and few nations appear to<lb/>adhere more strongly to the
                            customs of their ancestors than<lb/>these people, added to this, their
                            ardent attachment to<lb/>personal freedom, and their having heretofore
                            been entire strangers <lb/>to any kind of restraint renders them
                            impatient of labour &amp;<lb/>in some measure averse to the pursuits of
                            a steady industrious<lb/>life Those more immediately under the care of

                            accustomed<lb/>to feed, they are under less necessity of resorting
                            to<lb/>agriculture, than those tribes which are surrounded by<lb/>the
