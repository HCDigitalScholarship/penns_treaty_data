                <p>This collection of miscellaneous correspondence is housed at Friends Historical
                    Library, on the campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010,
                    Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between
                    in Early American Literature”) transcribed these manuscripts as part of a larger
                    project to make the library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more
                    accessible. The project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends
                    Historical Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English.
                    Transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by Professor Murray.

            <editorialDecl>
                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>

                <p>Brothers<lb/>When a time was agreed on <date when="1793">two years since</date>,
                    for kindling<lb/>Council fire at <placeName key="sandu">Sandusky</placeName>,
                    our hearts were made to rejoice, in hope the<lb/>good work of peace would go
                    forward; Six of our Brothers took a long journey<lb/>to see <del/>you at that
                    time, under a desire of affording their assistance<lb/>to make the Council fire
                    burn bright, but by the working of that bad Spirit<lb/>which <gap/>the
                    happiness of all Men, <del>that</del> the intended Treaty was frustrated, and
                        our<lb/><del>said</del>friends were under the painful necessity of returning
                    home with the<lb/>sorrowful tidings, that War, the sad destroyer of Mankind, was
                    likely to be<lb/>continued; since which the accounts received from your Country
                    of as much<lb/>Blood being shed <del>on both sides</del> have occasioned our
                    lamentation &amp; mourning.</p>
                <p>Brothers<lb/>We then sent you an Address, <del>accompanied with a small present
                        <lb/>as a Token of our Love and rememberance of you, which our said six
                        friends <lb/>entrusted</del> wch way <del>committed</del> directed by our sd

                    <del/>but as we have <del/>had no<lb/>information of your having received it, we
                    herewith send you a Copy. A<lb/>small present, as a token of our love &amp; and
                    remembrance of you, was also sent by our Brethren abovement.<lb/>which they had
                    not the satisfaction of delivering to you.</p>
                <p>Brothers<lb/>It affords us much Comfort that a stop is so far put to the
                    further<lb/>effusion of Blood, and we earnestly desire that in the Council
                    fire<lb/>now about to be kindled, your trust &amp; dependance may be on the
                    Great<lb/>over ruling Spirit of Peace &amp; Love, whereby he may be pleased so
                    to influence &amp; direct<lb/>your Councils as that the sound of War may no more
                    be heard in your<lb/>Land.</p>
                <p>Brothers<lb/>We have often been grieved at beholding the sad effects
                        <del>eperienced by</del> produced in unguarded Men of whatever Nation from

                    posterity to future Generations, and are anxiously solicitous that <del>in
