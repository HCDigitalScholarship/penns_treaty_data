                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>

                <p>I have made free to write a few Lines, and do inform<lb/> thee, I have been
                    stationed during this Winter, at <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanters Vil-<lb/>
                        lage</placeName>, about 9 miles from my two companions, in the Exercise of
                    Edu-<lb/> cating the Indian Children, not only in Litural knowledge, but, also,
                    in <lb/> other useful arts, It being the most Eligible place for the purpose,
                    who impr-<lb/> oves as rapid as can be expected, Although at times (I do
                    confess) my Oc-<lb/> cupation is very trying, and Exercising, even to my very
                    Soul; Yet by <lb/>the help of God: Do I hope to remain steadfast in the Faith,
                    and <del>in <lb/>the <unclear>dive</unclear> of my Duty</del> Business,
                    wherewith I am called; not doubting <lb/>the Lord's Providence over me, in the
                    discharge of any Duty to <emph rend="underline">Him</emph>, <lb/>among the
                    natives of this Mountainous Country; far distant from my <lb/>near &amp; Dear
                    Relations and former Friends -</p>
                <p>Be pleased to favour me with a few Lines, by the Bearer, of <lb/>information,
                    respecting <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, whether their Mill is
                    compleated, and how <lb/>many of our Society, at the present, are stationed
                    there, and whether <persName key="jsken1">Sken-<lb/>edo</persName>, &amp;

                    bestowed amongst them. I can truly say my mind is often <lb/>wafted over the
                    Mountains, to <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, with an Eye of
                    Compassion <lb/>towards the natives there, with desires for their lasting

                    <p>P.S. <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, informed me yesterday,
                        they had lately re-<lb/>ceived an Express, that their money had arrived a
                            <placeName key="canan">Canandarqua</placeName>, <lb/>And requested one
                        to write to thee, on his behalf, in the following Wor<lb/>ds, to shew thee
                        the reasons of his not attending thither himself, <lb/>(i.e.) He is not
                        shure the Money is yet come, and he has under<lb/>stood, that the <orgName
                            key="buffc2">Buffalo Indians</orgName> are desireous of holding the
                        Coun<lb/>cil at their Village, which if it is, he knows there will be much
                        Dru-<lb/>nkenness among them, as it has hitherto been the case, which he
                        does <lb/>not want to see. And rather Sensures thee on that account,
                        <lb/>for not using thy Power, especially at such times, to suppress
                        <lb/>that Evil habit among them - he knows that if the Council is held
                        <lb/>there the Chiefs will hardly keep sober, and if they do not, he is
                        certain <lb/>they will be incapable of making a just division of the Money;
                        which <lb/>he thinks is his right, for as he has heretofore been called to
                        all the Treaties <lb/>on Business of Importance, and the Arduous part
                        thereof have fell <lb/>on his shoulders &amp;c. He wishes thee to know the
                        number of People <lb/>who are under his care, which is 362 Souls, Eight of
                        whom he has sent for <lb/>the Money, and two others to carry their
                        provisions, his own Son, &amp; <lb/>Strong, he wants them to know the Sum of Money, in Each man's
                        <lb/>Pack, that none may get lost, and desires thee to dispatch them as
                        <lb/>soon as practicable, and to have the oversight of them, whilst there,
                        that they may <lb/>not get Drunk. He also desires thee to send him Word by
                        Letter, at the return <lb/>of his people, how matters are circumstanced
                        between him and <persName key="rmorr1">Robert Morris</persName>, who <lb/>he
                        says respecting some small matters betwixt them - <persName key="hsimm1"
