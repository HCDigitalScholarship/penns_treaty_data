                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and

                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                <p>Many of my friends having been solicitous<lb/> for the privilege of a perusal of
                    the minutes I<lb/> preserved in the course of my late visit to the<lb/> Western
                    Indians, I have been induced to devote<lb/> a small portion of leisure time to
                    the purpose of<lb/> attempting such an arrangement of them, as<lb/> would
                    convey, intelligibly, both the route we<lb/> took, and the various circumstances
                    attending<lb/> upon our journey.</p>
                <p>The judicious reader will doubtless make<lb/> proper allowances for the
                    difficulty there is in<lb/> composing an entertaining diary over that of a<lb/>
                    history, where circumstances are not necessarily<lb/> confined to day and
                    time.</p>
                <p>As a suitable introduction to my Journal, I<lb/> deem it proper to insert the
                    following letter. It<lb/> will serve to show the intercourse which had<lb/>
                    previously taken place between the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/>

                        <p>-We<lb/> have received you speech from the hand of our<lb/> friend,
                                <persName key="wwell1">Wm. Wells</persName>, with the implements
                            of<lb/> husbandry, that you were so kind to send to his<lb/> care,-all
                            in good order.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, it is our wish that the Great Spirit<lb/> will enable you to
                            render to your Red Brethren<lb/> that service which you appear to be so
                            desirous<lb/> of doing them, and which their women and<lb/> children are
                            so much in need of.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we will try to use the articles you<lb/> have sent us, and if
                            we should want more, we<lb/> will let you know it.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are sorry to say that the minds<lb/> of our people are not
                            so much inclined towards<lb/> the cultivation of the earth as we could
                            wish<lb/> them. </p>
                        <p>Brothers, our Father, the President of the<lb/> United States, has
                            prevented our traders from<lb/> selling liquor to our people, which is
                            the best<lb/> thing he could do for his Red Children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, our people appear dissatisfied, be-<lb/>cause our traders do
                            not, as usual, bring them<lb/> liquor, and, we believe, will request our
                            Father<lb/> to let the traders bring them liquor, and if he<lb/> does,
                            your Red Brethren are all lost forever.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you will see, from what we have<lb/><pb n="5" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_005"/> said, that our
                            prospects are bad at present,<lb/> though we hope the Great Spirit will
                            change the<lb/> minds of our people, and tell them it will be<lb/>
                            better for them to cultivate the earth than to<lb/> drink whiskey.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we hope the Great Spirit will per-<lb/>mit some of you to come
                            and see us,- when you<lb/> will be able to know whether you can do
                            any-<lb/>thing for us or not.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we delivered you the sentiments of<lb/> our hearts, when we
                            spoke to you at <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore,</placeName>* <note
                                rend="asterisk">*See Appendix.</note><lb/> and shall say nothing
                            more to you at present.<lb/> We now take you by the hand, and thank
                            you<lb/> for the articles you were so kind to send us. </p>

                    of 37 miles.</p>
                <p>A snow has been falling for some hours upon<lb/> the remains of a former snow ten
                    inches in<lb/> depth. Our journey to-day has been very en-<lb/>tertaining,
                    notwithstanding the severity of the <lb/><pb n="10" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_010"/> weather, and the danger at
                    this time attendant,<lb/> on climbing up and descending precipices.</p>
                <p>There is much in a journey over these moun-<lb/>tains to puzzle, as well as
                    amuse, the naturalist.<lb/> Many extraordinary natural curiosities have<lb/>
                    fallen under our observation, in the diversified<lb/> appearance of mountains,
                    rocks and valleys. We<lb/> have passed to-day the most ponderous, craggy
                    and<lb/> over-jutting rocks we have heretofore met with,<lb/> many of which were
                    elevated several hundred<lb/> feet above our heads, and seemed to threaten
                    us<lb/> with impending danger; which was not a little<lb/> magnified, in our
                    apprehensions, from observing<lb/> cast bodies of rock, which had evidently
                    tum-<lb/>bled from their lofty summits into the valleys.<lb/> Had we been
                    disposed to indulge fancy, we<lb/> might have figured to ourselves, in a view
                    of<lb/> these rude mountains of rocks, many of those<lb/> descriptions met with
                    in Roman, Greek or<lb/> Egyptian history, of amphitheatres, obelisks,<lb/>
                    pyramids, &amp;c. &amp;c; whilst many others exhibit-<lb/>ed such regular, wavy
                    appearences, interspersed<lb/> alternately with oaks and pines, and soil of<lb/>
                    various hues, as seemed to challenge the painter<lb/> with his diversified
                    shades of coloring. And could<lb/> we have observed here goats, white bears
                    and<lb/> reindeer, with now and then a human being<lb/> clothed in skins and
                    furs, and with weather a<lb/> little colder, we might, perhaps, have been
                    led<lb/> to suppose ourselves in Lapland. A few settle-<lb/>ments are made in
                    this tract, which are mostly<lb/><pb n="11" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_011"/> in the valleys. Deer are said to
                    be very numerous<lb/> upon these mountains-several were seen by us.<lb/> We also
                    observed seats erected in the branches<lb/> of the trees by the hunters, twenty
                    feet in height,<lb/> being concealed stations for the purpose of shoot-<lb/>ing
                    deer at the Salt Licks. We have also seen<lb/> several flocks of turkeys and

                    be<lb/> rich and clear of stone; of this, the snow pre-<lb/>vented us from
                    judging. We also crossed over that<lb/> part of the <geogName key="allmo"
                        >Alleghany ridge</geogName> which divides the<lb/> eastern and western
                    waters of our continent-<lb/> the streams all bearing a right hand
                    direction:<lb/> Near this part of the mountain, our road led us<lb/> through the
                    most beautiful and lofty forest of<lb/> spruce and pine I ever saw. This forest
                    is call-<lb/>ed the Shades. The trees are generally from<lb/> 108 to 180 feet in
                    height, with a body not<lb/> more than 12 inches in diameter at the surface<lb/>
                    of the earth.</p>
                <p>We also forded one of the branches of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="yough">Youghiogany river</geogName>, called the <geogName
                        key="lcross">Little Crossings</geogName>.<lb/> The principal ridges which we

                    <geogName key="negm">Negro Mountain</geogName>. On inquiring into the
                    origin<lb/><pb n="12" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_012"/> of the name of the latter, we were informed<lb/>
                    that many years ago, a white man and a negro<lb/> who were hunting together,
                    accidentally fell in<lb/> with an Indian upon this ridge who was armed;<lb/>
                    both the negro and the Indian betook them-<lb/>selves to trees, presented their
                    guns at each<lb/> other, and fired at the same moment, and both<lb/> fell dead.
                    Thier images are cut upon the trees<lb/> behind which they fell, as a memento of
                    the<lb/> circumstance. The ridge has ever since been<lb/> called the <geogName
                        key="negm">Negro Mountain.</geogName></p>
                <p>Deer and turkies are numerous upon these<lb/> mountains. The hunters have in many
                    places<lb/> erected seats, as heretofore described, for the pur-<lb/>pose of
                    shooting deer.</p>
                <p>Over the greater part of our journey to-day<lb/> we have found snow two feet in
                    depth. A tolera-<lb/>ble track is however beaten for us by a descrip-<lb/>tion
                    of pedlars, who pass by the name of Packers.<lb/> These people carry on a
                    considerable trade be-<lb/>tween the <placeName key="redst1"

                        >Winchester</placeName>,<lb/> in <placeName key="virgi"
                    >Virginia</placeName>, as also with several other villages<lb/> in the western
                    part of that State.</p>
                <p>They take with them upon horses, bags of<lb/> flax, which article they purchase
                    at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName> at<lb/> a low price; this they
                    dispose of at an advance,<lb/> and in return carry salt, for which they are
                    well<lb/> paid at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>. It is not
                    unusual to meet a<lb/> Packer, having under his direction half a dozen<lb/>
                    loaded horses. These animals on meeting travel-<lb/>lers, do not turn aside from
                    the beaten path. We<lb/><pb n="13" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_013"/> were several times under difficulties in

                        >Washington</persName> at the time<lb/> of his death.</p>
                <p>This day's journey has been very disagreeable<lb/> and cold, owing to a continued
                    fall of snow.<lb/> We greatly regretted that the clouds prevented<lb/> a view of
                    the <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName> settlements from the top<lb/>
                    of <placeName key="laure">Laurel Hill</placeName>, this being that part of the
                        <geogName key="allmo">Alle­<lb/>ghany Mountains</geogName> from which a
                    descent is made<lb/> into the country below. From this commanding<lb/> eminence
                    the prospect, we are told, is beautiful<lb/> beyond description.</p>
                <p>Our disappointment, however, was in some<lb/> measure recompensed by finding
                    ourselves, when<lb/> upon the top of this hill, not only above the<lb/> clouds,
                    but also so elevated in a cloud as to find<lb/> the particles of snow resembling
                    fog; a proof<lb/> that large spits of snow, as they are called, ac­<lb/>quire
                    their size by an accumulation of particles<lb/> on their way from the clouds to
                    the earth. I may<lb/> here mention, that the difficulties and fatigues<lb/> of
                    our journey thus far have been rendered light<lb/> by the agreeable company of
                    my brother-in-law,<lb/>

                        <p>My dear Brothers, Quakers, listen to what<lb/> I now say to you. You
                            always called us Indians<lb/> your brothers, and now, dear white

                        <p>Brothers, will you please to help me to fill<lb/> my kettles and my
                            horses' troughs, for I am afraid<lb/> my horses will not be able to

                <p>About the time of the reception of this letter,<lb/> some Friends, who resided
                    nearest to their hunt-<lb/>ing camp, furnished them with a small supply<lb/> of

                        <p>Brother Quakers, I have a few more words<lb/> to say to you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I want that you should all know<lb/> what distress I am in.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I want you to know I have got<lb/> help from some of my near
                            neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I would be glad to know what you<lb/> will do for me, if it is
                            but a little.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, if you cannot come soon, it will<lb/> do bye and bye, for my
                            belly is now full.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I hope you have not forgot our<lb/> great fathers; when they
                            first met, it was in<lb/> friendship; we are of the same race.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers, Quakers, I hope our friendship<lb/> will last as long as the
                            world stands. All I have<lb/>to say to you now is, that I shall stay
                            here until<lb/> two more moons are gone.</p>

                <p>A considerable quantity of provisions were<lb/> furnished by the Friends to these
                    Indians, for <lb/><pb n="17" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_017"/> which they expressed great thankfulness.
                        <persName key="tarh1">Tar-<lb/>hie</persName> himself divided the presents
                    between man<lb/> and man, making no difference for distinction<lb/> in rank.</p>
                <p>These Friends were informed by <persName key="trah1">Tarhie</persName>, that<lb/>
                    several years ago he had sent a talk to the <orgName key="bymindian"
                        >In-<lb/>dian Committee at <placeName key="balti1"
                        >Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, accompanied by a<lb/> belt of wampum,
                    worth fifty dollars, and had<lb/> long been waiting for an answer, but had
                    not<lb/> yet received one.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this information, a confer-<lb/>ence was held at <placeName
                        key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>, between such of the<lb/> members of the
                        <orgName key="bymindian">Indian Committee</orgName> as could be<lb/>
                    convened there. The result was a request made<lb/> to four Friends of the
                    neighborhood adjacent to<lb/> the Indian camp, to visit <persName key="tarh1"
                        >Tarhie</persName>, and inform him<lb/> that his talk was not received by
                    the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/> Committee</orgName>, and that his belt
                    of wampum never<lb/> came to their hands. Also, if he had any thing<lb/> now to
                    say, he must write again to the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/>
                        Committee</orgName>.</p>
                <p>During our stay at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>, we had an
                    op-<lb/>portunity of seeing and admiring the richness<lb/> of the land between
                    the foot of the <geogName key="allmo">Alleghany<lb/> Mountains</geogName> and
                    the <geogName key="monon">Monongahela River</geogName>. The<lb/> people here
                    seem to live in ease and plenty, and<lb/> there is scarcely a plantation that
                    does not afford<lb/> stone coal and sugar trees. The coal is, I think,<lb/>
                    fully equal in quality to the best Liverpool coal,<lb/> and is generally used
                    for fuel in the place of<lb/>wood; it being much easier and cheaper to pro-<lb/>
                    <pb n="18" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_018"/>cure a supply of coal, than to procure wood, not-<lb/>withstanding
                    that article is in great plenty here.</p>
                <p>The sugar trees afford sugar in plenty to those<lb/> who are sufficiently
                    industrious to make it. Many<lb/> families, we are told, make from five hundred
                    to<lb/> a thousand pounds, and others make from eight-<lb/>een to twenty-five
                    hundred weight, every spring.<lb/> The trees do not appear to be injured by
                    draw-<lb/>ing off the sap. Molasses of excellent quality<lb/> is also made from
                    this tree, and also small beer,<lb/> equal to any thing of the kind we met with
                    at<lb/> this place, produced from the sap.</p>
                <p>Shall I say, a proof of the instability of the<lb/> human mind, under the most
                    bountiful supply of<lb/> temporal blessings, is to be drawn from the
                    pre-<lb/>sent disposition of the inhabitants of <placeName key="redst1"
                        >Redstone</placeName>?<lb/> Blest with a country rich and fruitful, and
                    posses-<lb/>sing other great natural advantages, there is<lb/> nevertheless a
                    general feeling of discontent. The<lb/> new country beyond the <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, lately opened for<lb/> sale, has set the
                    general mind afloat. We saw<lb/> people who were well settled, and who some<lb/>
                    years ago, too, had passed the meridian of life,<lb/> strongly affected with the
                    prevailing mania.</p>

                    we are greatly disappointed in our wish<lb/> and intention to take boat at

                    no other alternative than to prosecute<lb/> a long and doubtless fatiguing
                    journey by land.<lb/> This morning, whilst we were preparing to pro-<lb/><pb n="19" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_019"/>eed on our route, two young men arrived at our<lb/> quarters, for
                    the purpose of accompanying us;<lb/> one of them a blacksmith, and a member of
                    our<lb/> Society, the other a carpenter, and a steady young<lb/> man. They are
                    under the pay of government,<lb/> and have engaged to reside in the
                    neighborhood<lb/> of <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, to be
                    employed for the benefit<lb/> and instruction of the Indians. Previous to
                    our<lb/> leaving home, we had reason to expect that we<lb/> should be overtaken
                    by these young men, and<lb/> were glad to have our expectations realized.</p>
                <p>Again proceeding on our journey, we passed<lb/> through <placeName key="brown"
                        >Brownsville</placeName>, a village on the <geogName key="monon"
                        >Mononga-<lb/>hela River</geogName>; crossed over that river in a boat,
                    and<lb/> rode about twenty-six miles to <placeName key="wash2">Washington</placeName>,
                    an<lb/> inland town. Our ride to-day has been through<lb/> a very hilly country,
                    tolerably rich, though badly<lb/> watered. It is said that one of the first
                    survey-<lb/>ors of this tract of country, when questioned re-<lb/>specting its
                    general appearance, replied, <said who="undetermined">It is<lb/> like a large
                        meadow filled with stacks of hay.</said><lb/> A comparison very apropos.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark, that near <placeName key="brown"
                    >Brownsville,</placeName><lb/> on the <geogName key="monon"
                        >Monongahela,</geogName> are the remains of an old<lb/> fortification,
                    including several acres of ground.<lb/> Mussel shells are yet very abnndant
                    within the<lb/> intrenchment; and nearly opposite to the forti-<lb/>fication are
                    two fish pots extending quite across<lb/> the river; they are made of stone,
                    weighing gene-<lb/>rally from thirty to forty pounds. It is said that<lb/> the
                    Indians who resided near the spot at the time<lb/><pb n="20" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_020"/> of its discovery
                    by the white men, had not even<lb/> a traditional knowledge of the making of
                    these<lb/> fish pots, nor of the erection of the fortification. </p>
                <p>This day, in passing along, my mind has been<lb/> involved in much serious
                    reflection on the im-<lb/>portance of our mission. And I trust I have in<lb/> no
                    small degree felt the responsibility we are<lb/> under, not to men only, but to
                    the Great Author<lb/> of all good, with an ardency not to be expressed,<lb/>
                    that we may indeed discharge the trust reposed<lb/> in us, and perform the duty
                    required of us with<lb/> propriety.</p>

                        >Monongahela</geogName> and the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio rivers</geogName>
                    are gene-<lb/>rally of a very singular description, having two<lb/> or three
                    circular elevations, the surface of each<lb/> elevation flat for the space of
                    twenty-five to<lb/> thirty feet in diameter. These flat appearances<lb/> extend
                    quite around the circumference of the<lb/> hills, and seem to vie with art for
                    regularity.</p>
                <p>This day we crossed in a boat the great <geogName key="ohior">river<lb/><pb n="21" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_021"/> Ohio</geogName>. On approaching it, I felt no small degree<lb/>
                    of awe. The slow and majestic movement of so<lb/> vast a body of running water,
                    added to the re-<lb/>collection of the blood which had been spilt re-<lb/>lative
                    to its shores, enforced the sensation. With<lb/> what obstinacy the poor Indians
                    resisted the de-<lb/>signs of the white men in making settlements<lb/> west of
                    this river! Having been driven further<lb/> and further westward, relinquished
                    claim to tract<lb/> after tract, they here made a stand, fixed in a
                    re-<lb/>solve, hitherto ye may come, but no farther!<lb/> This river shall be
                    the boundary between us!<lb/> It shall limit your encroachment! The
                    resist-<lb/>ance they made, and the blood which was split,<lb/> sufficiently
                    prove the reluctance with which they<lb/> gave up the contest. The bottom upon
                    the west<lb/> side of the river where we crossed, which was at<lb/> the junction
                    of <placeName key="shortc">Short Creek</placeName>, is very rich, but not<lb/>
                    wide. In this bottom we observed a mound of<lb/> earth cast up to the height of
                    fifteen feet, its<lb/> diameter at the base forty-five feet, and said to<lb/> be
                    a burial place, but whether made by the In-<lb/>dians or not is not ascertained.
                    It is said that<lb/> two miles below this is a square fortification<lb/>
                    containing several acres of ground, enclosed by<lb/> a bank of earth thrown up
                    by art to the height<lb/> of eight feet.</p>
                <p>Along the east shore of the river great de-<lb/>struction was made a few years
                    ago by a species<lb/> of caterpillar which infested the trees. They<lb/> fed
                    upon the leaves, and thus killed trees of<lb/><pb n="22" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_022"/> enormous size. Their
                    havoc extended for many<lb/> miles along the river, and reached about seven<lb/>
                    or eight miles from the shore. </p>

                <p>This day being First-day, we rested<lb/> ourselves and horses, and were glad to
                    have an<lb/> opportunity of attending a meeting of Friends,<lb/> called <orgName
                        key="short">Short Creek</orgName>
                        Meeting. A Monthly Meet-<lb/>ing is lately established here by

                        Quar-<lb/>terly Meeting</orgName>. About forty Friends were at<lb/> this
                    meeting, and most of them were new settlers.<lb/> The greater number had moved
                    from <placeName key="ncaro">North<lb/> Carolina</placeName>. The meeting was
                    held in a log house<lb/> or cabin, situated upon a beautiful hill, covered<lb/>
                    with lofty timber. The difficulties and incon-<lb/>veniences of a new
                    settlement, are rendered the<lb/> more easy and tolerable, where, as in the
                    instance<lb/> of these Friends, a number of families, by agree-<lb/>ment, form a
                    settlement in the same neighbor-<lb/>hood. In the afternoon several of them
                    visited<lb/> us at our lodgings, and expressed sympathy with<lb/> us in our
                    undertaking.</p>

                <p>Proceeded on our journey; travelled<lb/> thirty-one miles and reached <placeName
                        key="randt">Randallstown</placeName>; part<lb/> of the day has been rainy,
                    and the riding very<lb/> disagreeable. We have passed through a body<lb/> of
                    land heavily timbered and very rich. There<lb/> are yet but few settlements made
                    on this tract.<lb/> The first settlers in this new country erect small<lb/> log
                    cabins, which they cover with split timber<lb/> called puncheons; these they pin
                    to the rafters<lb/><pb n="23" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_023"/> with wooden pins. Nails are rarely to be
                    found<lb/> in any part of the house. Their floors are hewn<lb/> out of the
                    timber, and pinned to the sleepers<lb/> with wooden pins. They clear their land
                    by<lb/> killing the timber, which is done by girdling the<lb/> trees, that is by
                    cutting the bark around the<lb/> trees to the wood. They then proceed to
                    the<lb/> cultivation of the soil, which produces them abun-<lb/>dant crops.</p>
                <p>It is a common practice with them to sow<lb/> small grain upon the original
                    surface, which is<lb/> harrowed in, and such is the looseness and
                    light-<lb/>ness of the soil, there seems but little necessity<lb/> for the
                    plough in raising the first crop of grain.</p>
                <p>Our road led us across a water of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName><lb/>
                    called <geogName key="capte">Captena</geogName>; also several streams belonging

                    from its<lb/> slow, silent progress to the <geogName key="muskr"

                <p>This day we travelled twenty-five miles<lb/> and reached <placeName key="beath"
                        >Beathe's Ordinary</placeName>. We have had<lb/> a very disagreeable day's
                    ride. A continued fall<lb/> of rain, hail, and snow, and the road very miry<lb/>
                    and fatiguing to our horses. The land through<lb/> which we have passed not
                    quite so good gene-<lb/>rally as that noted yesterday. We, however,<lb/> saw
                    considerable bodies of excellent land, parti-<lb/>cularly of bottoms. Some of
                    them were of far<lb/> greater extent than any we have heretofore met<lb/> with,
                    being heavily timbered and very rich.<lb/> Scarcely a settlement has yet been
                    made in this<lb/><pb n="24" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_024"/> tract; deer are very plenty here. It is to be
                    re-<lb/>marked, that in riding the last fifty miles, we<lb/> have scarcely seen
                    one of any of the descriptions<lb/> of the feathered tribes, except owls. Birds
                    love<lb/> to resort to the haunts of men.</p>
                <p>Squirrels appear to be very numerous, and<lb/> are mostly of a deep black color.
                    In the notes<lb/> made on crossing the <geogName key="allmo">Alleghany
                        Mountains</geogName>, I<lb/> omitted to observe that the squirrels we
                    saw<lb/> there were mostly red, and less in size than the<lb/> grey squirrels of
                        <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>. They are the most<lb/> active
                    squirrel I ever saw, and are called by the<lb/> mountaineers the Chipparee

                <p>Travelled twenty-five miles, crossing in<lb/> our way the main branch of
                        <geogName key="willc">Will's Creek</geogName> and a <lb/> water called
                        <geogName key="saltc">Salt Creek</geogName>; at night reached <placeName
                        key="zanev">Zanes-<lb/>ville</placeName>, and lodged at <persName
                        key="minti1">M'Intire</persName>'s tavern. This is<lb/> a town lately laid
                    out on the <geogName key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogName>,<lb/> opposite to
                    the junction of <geogName key="lickc">Licking creek</geogName>. Its<lb/>
                    situation is very level and handsome, and will<lb/> doubtless command the trade
                    of this new coun-<lb/>try. As we approached the <geogName key="muskr"
                        >Muskingum</geogName>, our road<lb/>led us upon a hill of about 200 feet
                    elevation,<lb/> upon which we rode for a distance of seven<lb/> miles; both upon
                    our right and left hand, were<lb/> chains of hills about ten miles from us,
                    in<lb/><pb n="25" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_025"/> view, bearing the same westerly direction, with<lb/>
                    that upon which we travelled. The appearance<lb/>of these hills revived the

                <p>We ferried the beautiful <geogName key="muskr">river Muskingum</geogName> at<lb/>

                    rode<lb/> through a tolerable tract of land, till we reached<lb/> a creek called
                        <geogName key="jonac">Jonathan's creek</geogName>. From this<lb/> creek to
                    the end of this day's journey, a distance<lb/> of twenty miles, we rode through
                    land which we<lb/> think preferable to any tract we have yet passed,<lb/> being
                    more level, the timber heavier and the soil<lb/> very rich; many Germans are
                    making settlements<lb/> here. Several mounds fell under our observa-<lb/>tion
                    to-day; we also saw many deer; seventeen<lb/> of these were together in one

                <p>Rode thirty-two miles, and at night<lb/> were permitted to lodge under a roof
                    called<lb/> Gray's. We passed through <placeName key="newlan">New
                        Lancaster</placeName>, a<lb/> town lately laid out, and situated on the
                        great<lb/><geogName key="hockhr">Hock-hocking river</geogName>, as it is

                <p>This town as well as the neighboring country,<lb/> is being rapidly settled by
                    Germans. During<lb/><pb n="26" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_026"/> our day's ride, the extraordinary beauty of
                    the<lb/> country, as well as the superior excellency of the<lb/> land, excited
                    our admiration. Now and then a<lb/> prairie or natural meadow containing from
                    fifty<lb/> to two hundred acres, apparently a perfect level,<lb/> having neither
                    tree, shrub, stump, or stone, and<lb/> the soil the deepest black I ever saw in
                    any com-<lb/>position of earths, attracted our notice. These<lb/> were
                    surrounded by higher ground, covered with<lb/> lofty timber, extending to the
                    next prairie, and<lb/> thus on till we reached a tract called the <geogName
                        key="piquap">Piqua<lb/> Plains</geogName>. Here our admiration was afresh
                    excited<lb/> by a view of the most beautiful scenery we had<lb/> yet met with.
                    This tract is perfectly level; it is<lb/> situated upon the <geogName
                        key="sciot">Scioto river</geogName>, is seven miles in<lb/> length, and

                    composed<lb/> of the black earth above described; it is in part<lb/> under
                    cultivation. About the centre of the<lb/> prairie is a circular mound of large
                    diameter,<lb/> and about forty feet in height, cast up by art.<lb/> It is
                    covered with lofty timber. The people<lb/> who cultivate these plains find them
                    to produce<lb/> from eighty to one hundred bushels of Indian<lb/> corn, and from
                    forty to fifty bushels of Indian<lb/> corn, and from forty to fifty bushels of
                    wheat<lb/> per acre. They plant corn at the distance of<lb/> two and a half to
                    three feet apart, having six to<lb/> eight stalks in a hill.</p>
                <p>In the course of this day's journey we have<lb/> seen deer and turkeys in
                    abundance, and for<lb/><pb n="27" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_027"/> several days past have seen vast numbers

                <p>It is remarkable that there are uniformly<lb/> three gradations of elevation,

                    with<lb/> black walnut, buck eye, blue ash, honey locust,<lb/> and sugar trees.
                    Then upon another elevation<lb/> of about fifteen feet, a second bottom, which

                    an-<lb/>other elevation about the same height, which ex-<lb/>tends for many

                <p>The bank of earth thrown up around the for-<lb/>tification is about six feet
                    high, surrounded by<lb/> a ditch upon the outside, now four feet in width,<lb/>
                    and as many in depth. The bank is covered<lb/> with lofty timber, as is also the
                    ground within<lb/> the intrenchment. There are several mounds<lb/> such as have
                    heretofore been described in the<lb/> vicinity, and within the town of
                        <placeName key="chill">Chilicothe</placeName> there<lb/> is another
                    fortification of which the diameter is<lb/> about 450 feet. Near this is the
                    largest mound<lb/><pb n="29" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_029"/> we have seen, being 100 feet in diameter,
                    and<lb/> thirty feet in height, and is a globular figure of<lb/> great
                    regularity. Three miles below the town<lb/> of <placeName key="chill"
                        >Chilicothe</placeName>, and between the <geogName key="sciot"
                        >Scioto</geogName> and <geogName key="paintc">Paint<lb/> Creek</geogName>,
                    and near their junction, is a fortification<lb/> of the following figure:</p>

                <p>The banks of this ancient work are about six<lb/> feet in height. The eight small
                    circles opposite<lb/> the openings or gates are mounds of considerable<lb/>
                    size.</p>
                <p>I had omitted to mention, that on the east<lb/> bank of the <geogName key="sciot"

                        >Chilicothe</placeName>,<lb/> we measured to-day a sycamore tree which
                    was<lb/> sixteen feet in diameter. The tree is hollow,<lb/> and measures
                    thirteen feet across the hollow.<lb/> New settlers have frequently encamped in
                    this<lb/> tree with their families, whilst they were making<lb/> choice of land

                <p>Proceeded upon our journey fifteen<lb/> miles and lodged at Platter's tavern. On
                    our<lb/> way we passed many mounds. Several of them<lb/><pb n="30" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_030"/> were of the
                    shape and size of the one described<lb/> in the town of <placeName key="chill"
                        >Chilicothe</placeName>. Our attention was<lb/> also arrested by the
                    appearance of a bank thrown<lb/> up at some distance from the road; on riding
                    to<lb/> it we found it to be a very extensive fortifica-<lb/>tion. It is
                    situated upon a level plain near<lb/>
                    <geogName key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogName>, one of the waters of the
                        <geogName key="sciot">Scioto<lb/> river</geogName>. As this is a work of
                    great labor and curi-<lb/>osity, I shall be minute in my description and<lb/>
                    give the following figure.</p>

                <p>The bank which is cast up for the fortification<lb/> is now fully four feet in
                    height, and thirty-three<lb/> in width, at the base covered with lofty
                    timber.</p>
                <p>The figure marked (A) is a very regular oval<lb/> mound 500 feet in diameter,
                    from one extremity<lb/> to another the longest way, and 300 feet in<lb/>
                    diameter the other way; perpendicular height is<lb/> about thirty feet. This
                    mound is paved over<lb/> with stone, and has upon it trees of large size,
                    as<lb/> well as the remains of decaying trees, which<lb/> after acquiring their
                    full growth have fallen.<lb/> The two circles marked (B) are very perfect<lb/>
                    globular figures. They are one hundred feet in<lb/> diameter, and about thrity
                    feet perpendicular<lb/> height.</p>
                <p>The remaining eight small circles represent<lb/> mounds which are from eighty to
                    one hundred feet<lb/> in diameter, and from twenty-five to thirty feet<lb/>
                    perpendicular height, being also globular figures,<lb/> and all covered with
                    lofty timber. The semi-<lb/>circle (C) is a bank of earth thrown up to the<lb/>
                    height of about three feet, its diameter about<lb/> one hundred and fifty
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Near the outer banks of this extraordinary<lb/> fortification are many large
                    holes in the earth,<lb/> at least one hundred feet in diameter, and of<lb/>
                    considerable depth. These are no doubt places<lb/> out of which the earth was in
                    part taken for<lb/> making this work of labor.</p>
                <p>The land through which we have passed to-<lb/>day, is a continuation of a
                    country, very level <lb/><pb n="32" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_032"/> and beautiful, being situated on <geogName
                        key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogName>;<lb/> the soil, the same in appearance
                    as that de-<lb/>scribed yesterday, nothing seeming to indicate<lb/> its superior
                    richness, unless it be the size of its<lb/> timber. The heaviest and most
                    towering trees<lb/> we have seen, we met with to-day. Our progress<lb/> was
                    impeded by our curiosity to take the girth<lb/> of many trees; we measured white
                    oaks<lb/> which were from seven to eight feet in diameter;<lb/> walnuts, six to
                    seven feet four inches; elms, six<lb/> to six feet eight inches; ash, five feet,
                    and<lb/> honey locusts four feet in diameter; the girths<lb/> taken eight feet
                    above the surface of the earth.<lb/> These trees carried their thickness to an
                    amazing<lb/>height.</p>
                <p>We also measured a few sycamore trees, and<lb/> most of them were from eight to
                    ten feet in<lb/> diameter; one of the sycamores we measured<lb/> which was eight
                    feet in diameter, continued its<lb/> thickness forty-five feet without a limb,
                    its top<lb/> very branching and large. While we were admir-<lb/>ing it,
                        <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>* suggested an opinion<lb/>
                    that this tree, could it be split into cord-wood<lb/> after the common manner,
                    would measure forty<lb/> cords. At first we questioned the statement,<lb/> but
                    upon making a calculation, became con-<lb/>vinced that his estimate was within
                    bounds. </p>
                <p>These were not trees singled out as the only<lb/> monuments; we turned not aside
                    to search for<lb/> them, but measured such as fell under our own<lb/>observation
                    in passing over our road. It is more<lb/><pb n="33" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_033"/> than probable that there
                    are trees in the same<lb/> tract larger than any we saw. Few settlements<lb/>
                    are yet made here. </p>

                <p>Rode seventeen miles, and reached the<lb/> residence of our friend <persName
                        key="wlupt1">William Lupton</persName>, upon<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lee">Lee's Creek</geogName>, one of the head waters of <geogName
                        key="paintc">Paint<lb/> Creek</geogName>. Our road led us eight times across
                        <geogName key="paintc">Paint<lb/> Creek</geogName>; passing a great part of
                    the way through<lb/> the bottoms of <geogName key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogName>. The land the same<lb/> in appearance as remarked
                    yesterday. In the<lb/> course of our ride, we saw many hundreds of<lb/> poplars
                    which were the more observable, as we<lb/> have scarcely noticed a poplar since
                    we crossed<lb/> the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>. These trees are
                    generally seven to<lb/> eight feet six inches in diameter, many of them<lb/>
                    continuing their thickness for fifty feet in height,<lb/> and very handsome and
                    sound. On the bot-<lb/>toms we saw deer in abundance; they were<lb/> so gentle
                    as to allow us to pass by them<lb/> quite within gun shot. They appeared to
                    be<lb/> busy in cropping the young grass. We have<lb/> also observed several
                    mounds and fortifications<lb/> near the falls to <geogName key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogName>, and others nearly<lb/> adjacent of which the banks are
                    about three and<lb/> a half feet high.</p>
                <p>Upon this <geogName key="paintc">Creek</geogName> there are many beaver<lb/>
                    dams, and beavers are still caught here by the<lb/> Indians. For several days
                    past we have seen<lb/> many hunting camps but no Indians. Several<lb/> families
                    of Friends have settled in this remote<lb/> quarter of the Western Territory.
                    They have<lb/><pb n="34" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_034"/>removed from <placeName key="virgi"
                        >Virginia</placeName> and <placeName key="ncaro">North Carolina</placeName>,
                    and<lb/> expect to be followed by others. They tell us<lb/> that an indulged
                    meeting is held in one of their<lb/> houses.</p>
                <p>There is much to induce Friends of the South-<lb/>ern States, to remove to this
                    new country; for,<lb/> added to the consideration of the superior quality<lb/>
                    of the land, and the cheap and easy terms upon<lb/> which it is to be purchased,
                    there is an invalu-<lb/>able regulation in the Constitution of <placeName
                        key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>, pro-<lb/>hibiting the introduction of slaves.
                    The Con-<lb/>stitution has also provided that no person with-<lb/>in the State
                    shall voluntarily relinquish his right<lb/> to freedom. Its framers have even
                    gone further;<lb/> they declare that they have made these regula-<lb/>tions to
                    be binding both upon them and upon<lb/>their posterity.</p>
                <p>This truly valuable country is forbidden ground<lb/> to the <placeName
                        key="virgi">Virginia</placeName> slave holders. Many of them<lb/> have
                    approached as near to its borders as they<lb/> have dared, by settling along the
                    east shore of<lb/> the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName>; their
                    murmurs induced several<lb/> persons in the State of <placeName key="ohio"
                        >Ohio</placeName>, to offer themselves<lb/> as candidates to the late State
                    Legislature, de-<lb/>claring their determination to use their influence<lb/> in
                    obtaining an alteration in this part of the<lb/> Constitution. We are told that
                    on account of<lb/> this avowal, they met with the most pointed and<lb/> zealous
                    opposition; the people declaring gene-<lb/>rally, that one of the inducements
                    which led<lb/> them to emigrate to the State, was the Constitu-<lb/><pb n="35" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_035"/>tional provision by which slavery was interdicted,<lb/> and that any
                    alteration therein would be an in-<lb/>supportable grievance.</p>

                    of the wilderness.</p>
                <p>The settlement made here is composed cheifly<lb/> of Friends; about thirty
                    families reside in this<lb/> neighborhood. A Monthly Meeting is held<lb/> here
                    called <orgName key="miamm">Miami Monthly Meeting</orgName>, to which<lb/> about
                    thirty families more belong who are scat-<lb/>tered over an extensive tract of
                    country.</p>
                <p>Our attention was attracted to-day by the ap-<lb/>pearance of the stone, not only
                    in the beds of<lb/><pb n="37" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_037"/> the rivers and creeks, but also upon the
                    hills<lb/> and in the valleys. They are limestone, and are<lb/> composed
                    altogether of marine shells. The stone<lb/> when broken discovers the size and
                    shape of the<lb/>shells very perfectly.</p>
                <p>These shells are of the same description with<lb/> those I have formerly obtained
                    from the banks<lb/> of the <geogName key="chesab">Chesapeake Bay</geogName>, in
                    the lower part of the<lb/> State of <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>.
                    It may be remarked, that<lb/> no shell-fish of this description are at present
                    to<lb/> be found in any of the waters of our Continent.</p>
                <p>The country west of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName> through<lb/>
                    which we have passed is a limestone country,<lb/> the very pebbles and even sand
                    in many places<lb/> are limestone.</p>
                <p>Heretofore I have omitted to mention that in<lb/> the neighborhood of <placeName
                        key="chill">Chilicothe</placeName>, we amused our-<lb/>selves with the
                    earths and stones, which were<lb/> dug out of the ground in sinking wells.
                    There<lb/> are several layers or strata of limestone, gravel,<lb/> and sand,
                    within a few feet of the surface of the<lb/> earth. Some of the stones contain
                    the above<lb/> description of marine shells, and in breaking<lb/> some of the
                    large gravel we found appearances<lb/> of the same shells. The stones as well as
                    the<lb/> gravel have evident marks of their having been<lb/> washed with water,
                    their shape inclining greatly<lb/> to rotundity.</p>

                        <placeName key="dayt">Dayton</placeName>, where<lb/> we lodged. This town is

                    here about one<lb/> hundred and sixty feet in width. We have<lb/> passed to day
                    the Ridge which divides the waters<lb/> of the <geogName key="littlemr"
                        >Little</geogName> and <geogName key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogName>, and

                    through which we have passed to-day,<lb/> is of the most beautiful and desirable
                    de-<lb/>scription. The land lies in waves of great regu-<lb/>larity, is crossed
                    with heavy towering timber,<lb/> and the soil inexhaustibly rich. At <placeName
                        key="dayt">Dayton</placeName><lb/> were two block houses, which were erected
                    by<lb/> the white men, as places of retreat and defence<lb/> against an attack
                    by the Indians.</p>

                    above its mouth.<lb/> The river derives its name from its swift current.<lb/> We
                    also crossed several streams belonging to the<lb/>

                <p>This day after riding fifteen miles, we<lb/> reached <placeName key="flino"
                        >Flinn's ordinary</placeName>, where we were disap-<lb/>pointed in finding
                    no feed for our horses. We<lb/> also received the information that there was
                    no<lb/> probability of our obtaining provision for them<lb/><pb n="39" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_039"/> short
                    of <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>; we therefore despatched<lb/> a
                    part of our company to a house we had passed<lb/> about four miles, in quest of
                    corn. They obtained<lb/> four bushels, and hired a man and horse to travel<lb/>
                    with us and bring the corn along. For many<lb/> days past our horses have
                    suffered for want of<lb/> hay, and being fed altogether upon corn they<lb/> have
                    lost their appetites.</p>
                <p>The face of the country in the course of this<lb/> day's short journey is a
                    continuation of beautiful<lb/> land; being level, and finely timbered. We<lb/>
                    passed through a handsome prairie containing<lb/> several hundred acres called
                    the Lower <geogName key="piquap">Piqua<lb/> Plain</geogName>, crossed <geogName
                        key="honeyc">Honey Creek</geogName> and <geogName key="lostc">Lost
                        Creek</geogName>,<lb/> two considerable streams of the <geogName key="gmiam"
                        >Great Miami</geogName>.</p>
                <p>Thus far in our route we have been favored<lb/>with respect to the waters, no
                    rain having fallen<lb/> lately to raise the creeks and rivers to a height<lb/>
                    sufficient to detain us. In fording some of the<lb/> streams we have thought
                    that even six inches<lb/> greater depth would take our horses off their
                    feet.<lb/> There is considerable danger in fording many of<lb/> the streams we
                    have passed, from the uneveness<lb/> of the stony bottoms of the rivers. The
                    beds of<lb/> the rivers are mostly limestone, and being worn<lb/> smooth by the
                    washing of the water, horses are apt<lb/> to fall. This was to-day the case with
                    my horse in<lb/> fording the <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>, from which
                    accident I got<lb/> very wet. </p>
                <p>During our detention here this afternoon, we<lb/> observed a flock of birds
                    alighting from the trees,<lb/><pb n="40" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_040"/> different in appearance from any we
                    had seen.<lb/> Our landlord informed us they were parrots, and<lb/> that they
                    were common upon the <geogName key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogName>;<lb/> and to
                    gratify our curiosity he shot one. It was<lb/> about the size of a dove, and its
                    plumage resem-<lb/>bled the green parrot of South America, the<lb/> head red,
                    and the wings tipped with the same<lb/> color, the tail long and the bill and
                    tongue of<lb/> the same description as the chattering parrot.<lb/> As they
                    alighted from the trees, they made a<lb/> hoarse noise resembling the chattering
                    of the<lb/> common parrot.</p>
                <p>There is also a woodcock here resembling the<lb/> red headed woodcock of
                        <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>, except that<lb/> its head is
                    black and its bill ivory.</p>
                <p>At this place <persName key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName> erected a<lb/>
                    fortification when on his march against the In-<lb/>dians, a part of which is
                    now standing. Our<lb/> landlord occupies one of the houses which was<lb/> at
                    that time built and enclosed within the stock-<lb/>ade. From the late period in
                    the day at which<lb/> our supply of corn arrived for the horses, we<lb/> have
                    concluded to remain at our quarters; the<lb/> landlord tells us we shall be
                    welcome to sleep<lb/> upon his floor, and has promised to make us a<lb/> good
                    fire to sleep by. </p>
                <p>This is a kind of lodgment to which we have<lb/> become well accustomed, having
                    heretofore in<lb/> our journey often had to wrap ourselves in our<lb/> blankets
                    and to lie upon floors, always observing<lb/> the necessary precaution of laying
                    our feet to the<lb/> fire; we have in no instance taken cold.</p>

                <p>This day rode fourteen miles, and on<lb/> our way passed a larger prairie than
                    the one we<lb/> saw yesterday, which is called the Upper <geogName key="piquap"
                        >Piqua<lb/> Plains</geogName>. We have also passed a body of land<lb/>
                    heavily timbered, but its very level situation<lb/> renders it not desirable.
                    Through this tract we<lb/> have found a very deep and miry road, and<lb/> have
                    regretted the neccesity of a slow movement.<lb/> Our hired man has to lead his
                    horse, the bag of<lb/> corn being too heavy for the horse to bear his<lb/>
                    weight also. We reached a place called Lora-<lb/>mier's store, where we found a
                    shelter and<lb/> lodged, having through the latter part of the<lb/> day rode
                    through rain. On our way we twice<lb/> crossed a considerable water of the
                        <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName> called<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lorac">Loramier's Creek</geogName>.</p>
                <p>At this place there is a very large fortification<lb/> made by <persName
                        key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName> called <placeName key="floram">Fort
                        Loramier</placeName>.<lb/> And here it is that the line of division
                    between<lb/> the white people and the Indians passes agree-<lb/>ably to the
                    treaty of peace* <note rend="asterisk">*Treaty of Greenville, for which see
                        Appendix.</note> between the Indians<lb/> and <persName key="gwayn1">General
                        Wayne</persName>. I may here remark that<lb/> for many days in passing
                    along, we have ob-<lb/>served hunting camps erected by the Indians,<lb/> but no
                    Indians in them.</p>
                <p>It is probable they are at present at or near<lb/> their towns. We have observed
                    from day to<lb/> day many curious, and to us unitelligible In-<lb/>dian
                    hieroglyphics cut upon the trees. We have<lb/> also been entertained in
                    examining these figures,<lb/> sometimes cut, at other times painted on the
                    <lb/><pb n="42" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_042"/>wood after cutting away the bark, the figures of<lb/> elks,
                    the horns of the elk, the figures of buffaloes,<lb/> bears, wolves, deer,
                    raccoons, and various other<lb/> wild beasts, and birds of different species;
                    turtles<lb/> and reptile creatures; also the representation of<lb/> men, women
                    and children, boys with bows and<lb/> arrows shooting game, and men with
                    their<lb/> guns aiming at game, or in the act of pursuing<lb/> it, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As a testimony in favor of the virtue and<lb/> modesty of these men of the woods,
                    I note, that<lb/> we have not yet observed amongst this variety<lb/> of figures,
                    one unchaste representation.</p>

                <p>Rode twenty-two miles through a flat<lb/> country, heavily timbered; at night we
                    encamped<lb/> in the woods, made a large fire, fared sumptu-<lb/>ously upon wild
                    pigeons, wrapped ourselves in<lb/> our blankets and slept soundly. Our
                    pigeons<lb/> were shot by one of our company who carries a<lb/> gun. There are
                    at this time vast numbers of<lb/> this fowl scattered over the woods. They
                    breed<lb/> here undisturbedly. Squirrels are also very<lb/> numerous. We now and
                    then see a few deer.<lb/> They are not plenty here. Wolves, opossums,<lb/>
                    reaccoons, and some other descriptions of wild<lb/> game are abundant. We have
                    not yet seen a<lb/> bear, though they are very plenty throughout<lb/> the region
                    we have passed over. This is owing<lb/> to a remarkable fact in the history of
                    this crea-<lb/>ture. They betake themselves to dens in the<lb/> holes of trees,
                    at an early period of the winter,<lb/><pb n="43" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_043"/> where they remain till the
                        <date when="1804-04-01">1st of the 4th month</date>.<lb/> During this
                    interval they never leave their holes,<lb/> and as they lay up no store for the
                    winter sup-<lb/>ply, it is certain they live without eating. The<lb/> Indians
                    say they live by sucking their paws.<lb/> The means by which their lives are
                    supported<lb/> in their recluse situation, I shall not undertake<lb/> to
                    determine. I shall however observe that when<lb/> taken from their dens they are
                    always very fat.<lb/> We have met with much of their meat, and can<lb/> assert
                    that we have seen the thickness of four<lb/> inches of fat between the skin and
                    the lean which<lb/> covers the ribs. During the winter the Indians<lb/> find the
                    bears by searching for their dens in the<lb/> trees, which they know by the
                    marks made by<lb/> the claws of the bear in climbing.</p>
                <p>We have now reached the waters of the lakes,<lb/> having to day forded one of the
                    forks of the <geogName key="stmar">St.<lb/> Mary's river</geogName>. On our way
                    we passed for a few<lb/> miles along a road one hundred feet wide, cut<lb/> by
                        <persName key="gwayn1">General Wayne's</persName> army for transporting
                    pro-<lb/>visions from the <geogName key="gmiam">great Miami</geogName> to the
                        <geogName key="stmar">St. Mary's<lb/> river</geogName>. The road is now
                    grown up with briars<lb/> and shrubs.</p>
                <p>Shortly after we had made our fire, and with<lb/> the approach of night we heard
                    at a short dis-<lb/>tance from us, a whooping in the woods. We<lb/> had reason
                    to believe from the shrill and uncom-<lb/>mon whoop, that it was the voice of an
                    Indian,<lb/> and having understood that it was a custom<lb/> among them when
                    about to approach a camp, to<lb/><pb n="44" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_044"/> give notice by a whoop, we failed
                    not to return<lb/> the ceremony also by a whoop. In a few mo-<lb/>ments two
                    Indian men upon a horse, followed by<lb/> two women and a girl upon another
                    horse, rode<lb/> up to our camp. Their countenances were smil-<lb/>ing and
                    indicative of friendship. As we reached<lb/> them our hands, they shook them
                    saying, <said who="undetermined"><foreign xml:lang="del">Saga,<lb/> Saga,
                            niches,</foreign></said> which we have since learned was<lb/> the

                <p>Very early this morning we again pro-<lb/>ceeded, and this day rode thirty miles,
                    a laborious,<lb/> fatiguing journey to ourselves and horses. Our<lb/> path
                    leading through a flat country we find the<lb/> travelling miry and deep. Our
                    horses are to be<lb/> pitied, the stock of corn we procured for them<lb/> is
                    exhausted, and the only food they can<lb/> now get is the grass in the woods.
                    For several<lb/> nights past we have turned them loose to graze.<lb/> These poor
                    creatures feed around our camps and<lb/> appear afraid to leave us.</p>
                <p>This day we crossed the <geogName key="stmar">St. Mary's</geogName> where
                    its<lb/><pb n="45" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_045"/> width was about one hundred and fifty feet, it is<lb/>
                    said to be a very deep river. An old Indian<lb/> and his squaw reside here, and
                    he undertook to<lb/> ferry us across in a canoe. Our horses swam<lb/> the river,
                    and got over well. The old Indian,<lb/> whose name is <persName key="steph1"
                        >Stephen</persName>, very unintentionally<lb/> swam also. This accident was
                    owing to the mis-<lb/>conduct of some of the packers, who, on their<lb/> way to
                        <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName> with provisions, gave
                        <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName><lb/> too much whisky. <persName
                        key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName> was in the<lb/> canoe with him when he
                    accidentely fell over-<lb/>board; we were greatly alarmed for his safety,<lb/>
                    knowing that he was intoxicated, but after dis-<lb/>appearing for a few seconds,
                    he rose to the sur-<lb/>face of the water, and soon convinced us that he<lb/>
                    could swim. <persName key="pdeni1">Philip</persName> caught him by his
                    blanket,<lb/> and got him again into the boat. The old man<lb/> laughed very
                    heartily at the accident, saying to<lb/> us in broken English, <said
                        who="steph1">No fear, me ferry you<lb/> in de canoe yet.</said> Our
                    blacksmith having in-<lb/>formed <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName> of
                    his expectation of settling in<lb/> the Indian country for the benefit of the
                    red<lb/> people, and the old man finding also that our<lb/> company were all
                    prosecuting their travels for<lb/> benevolent purposes, exercised his gratitude
                    by<lb/> telling us <said who="steph1">You pay one quarter dollar de man;<lb/>
                        nobody keep canoe here but <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName>; he
                        make<lb/> the white people pay dollar, I make dem packers<lb/> pay me de
                        rest.</said> In <persName key="steph1">Stephen's</persName> hut we
                    observed<lb/> several Indians who were asleep. He says they<lb/> are Indians who
                    have come a great distance and<lb/><pb n="46" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_046"/> are tired. During the greater
                    part of this day<lb/> we have rode through a heavy rain. The rain<lb/>
                    continuing with the approach of night, we made<lb/> a large fire, and erected a
                    shelter in imitation of<lb/> the Indian hunting camps, covering it with our<lb/>
                    blankets. Under this we slept, and were but<lb/> little incommoded,
                    notwithstanding the rain<lb/> continued during the greater part of the
                    night.</p>
                <p>I must not omit to mention that we to-day<lb/> passed through a very level plain
                    containing<lb/> many thousand acres. This plain is almost with-<lb/>out trees.
                    The soil nearly hid by weeds and<lb/> grass of last year's growth; the
                    luxuriance of<lb/> which plainly demonstrates its extraordinary fer-<lb/>tility.
                    In this plain we observed a small pond<lb/> or lake in which were wild geese and
                    ducks in<lb/> abundance. We are informed that this is one<lb/> of the places
                    where wild fowl raise their young.</p>

                <p>Pursued our path and travelled twenty-<lb/>three miles through a very fertile,
                    heavily tim-<lb/>bered and beautiful country, being a little more<lb/> inclined
                    to hills. The ride to-day has been a<lb/> pleasing one, in part doubtless from
                    the reflec-<lb/>tion that the day would probably close a long,<lb/> tedious and
                    arduous journey. We at last reached<lb/><placeName key="fwayn">Fort

                        >Fort</placeName>,<lb/> having reached it within about thirty rods, we<lb/>
                    were saluted by a sentinel with the word <said who="undetermined"
                    >Halt.</said><lb/> We obeyed the command. A sergeant was de-<lb/>spatched from
                    the commanding officer, who en-<lb/>quired of us on his behalf, <said

                    business.</p>
                <p>The officer shortly returned to us with an in-<lb/>vitation to advance; we

                    busied with their several occupations. After<lb/>breakfast we paid a visit to

                    several hours with returned<lb/> to our quarters. In the afternoon we
                    observed<lb/> three Indians advancing toward our lodgings,<lb/> and soon
                    discovered that one of them was the<lb/><persName key="fmeda1">Five

                    the only information he had ob-<lb/>tained was that some Quakers had come.
                    Busi-<lb/>ness had brought him to the fort. They were<lb/> invited into our
                    room, when the chief instantly<lb/> recognized us both. He appeared glad to
                    see<lb/> us, and shook hands with both of us very hearti<lb/>ly. A person being
                    present who understood the<lb/><orgName key="potaw">Pottowattamy</orgName>
                    language, he said to him pointing<lb/> to me, <said who="undetermined">This is

                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> very deliberately and
                    can-<lb/>didly replied to our inquiry after his health as<lb/> follows: <said
                        who="fmeda1">That in the course of last fall he went<lb/> to <placeName
                            key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, that whilst there the white people<lb/>
                        made him drink whiskey. That after he had<lb/> accomplished his business
                        there, he set out for<lb/> his home, and got upon his horse whilst the<lb/>
                        whiskey was in his head. That he had not rode<lb/> far before he fell from
                        his horse, and was very<lb/> much hurt by the fall, and that ever since
                        that<lb/> time he had not been well.</said></p>
                <p>After some further mutual inquiries, relative<lb/> to the welfare of red and
                    white acquaintance, we<lb/> we informed him through an interpreter that we<lb/>
                    had come to see our red brethren, that we had<lb/> messages for both the
                        <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> and himself,<lb/> and were
                    glad that it had so happened that we<lb/> had come. That we hoped the <persName
                        key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName><lb/> would come to-morrow, and that we
                    wished to<lb/> see them together, having something to say to<lb/> them. He
                    appeared pleased with this informa-<lb/>tion, and expressed that he had made a
                    camp<lb/> not far off, where he would wait for the arrival<lb/> of the <persName

                    land-<lb/>lord.</p>
                <p>About mid-day the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>arrived. He<lb/>

                    great<lb/> gladness at meeting with us. He inquired very<lb/> particularly after

                    and the difficulties we had encoun-<lb/>tered on our journey through the
                    wilderness.<lb/> Having answered his questions, he replied in<lb/> turn to our
                    inquiries as follows: That since he<lb/> saw us it had pleased the Great Spirit
                    to take<lb/> away two of his brothers and a nephew. That<lb/> his nephew was the
                        <persName key="toad1">Toad</persName>, a young chief who<lb/> was with him
                    in <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>. That he died on<lb/> his
                    return from that visit, and within a few miles<lb/> of home, of which
                    circumstances he had desired<lb/><persName key="wwell1">William Wells</persName>
                    to inform us. That with respect<lb/> to himself, he was but half well, having
                    been<lb/> very sick last fall and expected to die. That<lb/> his white brothers
                    at <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, hearing of<lb/> his illness,
                    sent a doctor to him who gave him<lb/> physic and made him better. That he had
                    now<lb/> seen fifty-three winters, and two of his brothers<lb/> being dead, made
                    him think of death, and that<lb/> his time would soon come.</p>
                <p>He also told us that he had left a brother at<lb/> his town who would have
                    accompanied him,<lb/> being desirous to come with him, but could<lb/> not find
                    his horse in time. After this, other<lb/> conversation took place of a general
                    nature. The<lb/> interpreter informs us that his complaint is the<lb/>
                    <pb n="54" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_054"/> gout, and that in the time of his illness he (the<lb/> interpreter)
                    had told him that his complaint be-<lb/>longed to great folks and gentlemen.

                <p>About 2 o'clock we dined. At the head of the<lb/> table sat the interpreter's

                    a distinguished chief. She had prepared for<lb/> us a large well roasted wild
                    turkey, and also a<lb/> wild turkey boiled, and for these she had pro-<lb/>vided

                    had carefully ob-<lb/>served all that was contained in that talk. That<lb/> we

                            the fatigue of so long a jour-<lb/>ney, and therefore did not come. The
                            other<lb/> did not omit to come for the want of love to his<lb/> red
                            brethren; family circumstances rendered it<lb/> inconvenient for him to
                            leave home. You see,<lb/><pb n="57" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_057"/> brothers, that it has pleased the
                            Great Spirit<lb/> that two of us mentioned in the letter, should<lb/>
                            reach the country of our red brethren. Brothers,<lb/> we thought it
                            right in the first place to send for<lb/> you, and to show you the
                            letter which has just<lb/> been read. We are glad that you are now
                            come,<lb/> and that we have this opportunity of taking you<lb/> by the
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we believe that we have some things<lb/> to say to you which
                            are of great importance to<lb/> our red brothers, to their old men, to
                            their young<lb/> men, to their women, and to their children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we may now mention that we have<lb/> not come merely to talk,
                            but we hope we have<lb/> come prepared to do a little for the welfare
                            of<lb/> our red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, in looking over our business, we<lb/> have thought that we
                            should be glad to have an<lb/> opportunity of seeing our red brethren
                            together,<lb/> and are willing to propose for your consideration,<lb/>
                            that you should now fix upon some place, and<lb/> agree upon some time
                            to meet us again, and that<lb/> our brothers invite their old men, their
                            young<lb/> men, their women and their children to meet us,<lb/> when we
                            shall have something to say which it<lb/> may not be necessary now to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,- Should you think<lb/> that the proposal which we
                            have now made is<lb/> proper, and conclude to meet us in the manner<lb/>
                            we have pointed out, we expect we shall have<lb/> but little more to say
                            at present.</p>

                <p>Here a pause <lb/><pb n="58" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_058"/> for some minutes took place, when the <persName
                        key="lturt1">Little<lb/> Turtle</persName> inquired, <said who="lturt1">If
                        the Friends had more to<lb/> say.</said> He was answered in the
                    negative.</p>
                <p>After a further pause and some conversation<lb/> between the two chiefs, they
                    rose from their<lb/> seats, and perceiving that they were advancing<lb/> toward
                    us, we also arose from our seats. On meet-<lb/>ing them, they took us by the
                    hand, and with<lb/> countenances indicative of great gravity, shook<lb/> hands
                    with us and returned to their seats.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> then commenced a speech<lb/> as

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: My friend, the <persName key="lturt1">Lit-<lb/>tle
                                Turtle</persName>, and myself, together with my two<lb/> sons, who
                            are present, rejoice to have this oppor-<lb/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<lb/> hand.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers: We are glad to be informed,<lb/> that you received our talk
                            sent to you last fall,<lb/> and to find that you are now come to the
                            country<lb/> of your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends: We rejoice that<lb/> the Great Spirit has
                            conducted you safely to our<lb/> country, and figure to ourselves that
                            in you we<lb/> see the rest of our brothers and friends of <placeName
                                key="balti1">Balti-<lb/>more</placeName>, and that in taking you by
                            the hand, we<lb/> take them by the hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We know that you have come a<lb/> long distance to see the
                            situation of your red<lb/> brethren. We have no doubt that you have<lb/>
                            things to say which are of great importance to<lb/>
                            <pb n="59" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_059"/>us, and which do not belong to a few only but<lb/> to many. </p>
                        <p>Brothers: Your brethren the Indians do<lb/> business not as the white
                            people do. We con-<lb/>vene our chiefs, and things of importance
                            are<lb/> considered by them. But, brothers, you have<lb/> come to see
                            the situation of your red brethren.<lb/> It is our wish that you should
                            see it. You shall<lb/> not be disappointed. The proposal you have<lb/>
                            made to us we think right, and have concluded<lb/> that this place
                                (<placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>,) is the best
                            place<lb/> to be fixed upon for the purpose you wish. We<lb/> are
                            pleased to find that you have a desire that<lb/> our young men should be
                            present to hear what<lb/> you have to say, and as it is your wish to see
                            our<lb/> women and children, we desire that you may<lb/> have an
                            opportunity of seeing them.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: Our young men are<lb/> out hunting, and our women
                            and children are<lb/> now at work at their sugar camps. The time is<lb/>
                            not far off when they will all return to our<lb/> towns, when it is
                            usual to meet together. We<lb/> hope, brothers, that you will not be in
                            a hurry,<lb/> but will allow us time to collect our people
                            to-<lb/>gether.</p>

                <p>Here a pause took place, when we inquired if<lb/> they had any thing further to
                    add. And being<lb/> answered in the negative, we addressed them<lb/> again in
                    substance as follows:</p>

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: When we left our <lb/><pb n="60" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_060"/> homes, we knew
                            it was early in the season, and<lb/> expected that we should ge to the
                            country of<lb/> our red brethren at a time when their young<lb/> men,
                            their women and children would be busy.<lb/> But brothers, a part of the

                            that we<lb/> should now be in a hurry.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We will also add that when we<lb/> were chosen by our friends
                            at home to pay a<lb/> visit to our red brethren, our women and
                            chil-<lb/>dren consented that we should leave them, but<lb/> charged us
                            that we should not stay away from<lb/> them longer than circumstances
                            really required.<lb/> A long time has already past since we left
                            them,<lb/> we therefore hope, brothers, that in three or four<lb/> days
                            it will be in your power to get together<lb/> some of your people. Those
                            that are far from<lb/> home we do not wish that you should send for.</p>

                <p>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> then observed that the
                    res-<lb/>sons we had given were good. The <persName key="fmeda1">Five
                        Medals</persName><lb/> next remarked that at the time proposed, they<lb/>
                    could easily convene a considerable number of<lb/> their indolent people, who
                    were too lazy to hunt<lb/> or make sugar, but such they did not wish us to<lb/>
                    see. Their industrious young men and women <lb/>
                    <pb n="61" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_061"/>were too far from home to be convened in so<lb/> short a time.</p>
                <p>Here a short conversation took place between<lb/> the chiefs, and afterwards they
                    proposed seven<lb/> day's hence as the time; desiring that to-morrow<lb/> might
                    not be counted, as it would take them a<lb/> day to return home. To this we
                    consented.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> then expressed as follows:</p>

                        <p>Brothers, it would have been very desirable<lb/> to us if you could have
                            met us at the time of our<lb/> counsel. We have very often told our
                            people<lb/> of the Quakers. They listen to us, but are at a<lb/> loss to
                            know what sort of people the Quakers<lb/> are. If you could stay,
                            brothers, they would<lb/> have an opportunity of seeing the Quakers,
                            and<lb/> of hearing words from your own mouths.</p>

                        <p>Brothers: We hope the words that you<lb/> may say to us at the time we
                            have appointed to<lb/> meet will be upon paper. From that paper we<lb/>
                            can at some future time have your words de-<lb/>livered to our people.
                            This, brothers, will in some<lb/> measure answer the end.</p>

                <p>During a pause which occupied several<lb/> minutes we asked them if we understood

                <p>After this we took each other by the hand<lb/> and very cordially bade farewell.
                    We then re-<lb/>turned to our lodgings.</p>

                <p>In the evening we again had the company of<lb/> the chiefs, they having been

                    is<lb/> made from the sugar tree. This art has long<lb/> been known to the

                <p>We were shown the tree behind which the<lb/><pb n="64" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_064"/>
                    <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> took his station, as also a tree
                    near<lb/> it behind which <persName key="toad1">his nephew</persName> fell. This
                    was a<lb/> second defeat, the United States troops having<lb/> been routed the

                <p>Spent the day in the neighborhood of<lb/>
                    <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, in the course of which we visited<lb/>
                    <persName key="awhip1">Captain Whipple</persName>. This afternoon several
                    In-<lb/>dians from different tribes arrived, bringing<lb/> with them skins and
                    furs. These are mostly<lb/> brought by the women upon their backs, the<lb/> men
                    thinking it sufficient to carry their guns<lb/> and hunting equipments.</p>
                <p>We saw this evening a white woman, who,<lb/> when a small girl, had been taken
                    captive, and<lb/> has ever since lived amongst the <orgName key="potaw"
                        >Pottowatamy<lb/> tribe</orgName> of Indians. She tells us (through an
                    in-<lb/>terpreter) that she has no knowledge of the<lb/> part of the country
                    from which she was taken,<lb/> nor of her family. That she remembers her
                    name<lb/> was Dolly, which is the only distinct recollec-<lb/>tion she retains
                    of herself previous to her cap-<lb/>tivity. This woman is dressed in Indian
                    habit,<lb/> is painted after the Indian order, and has so<lb/> effectually
                    adopted Indian manners, that a nice<lb/> observer would not discover from
                    external ob-<lb/>servation her origin, except from the color of<lb/> her eyes,

                    up the <geogName key="stmar">St. Mary's</geogName> about five miles. On<lb/> our
                    way we passed several sugar camps, at which<lb/> were Indian women and children
                    who were em-<lb/><pb n="65" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_065"/>ployed in making sugar. Their huts were large,<lb/>
                    and covered with the bark of the Buck Eye<lb/> wood. Their troughs for catching
                    the sugar<lb/> water as it is called, are made of the bark of the<lb/> red elm,
                    they are made thin, and the ends tied<lb/> together. We were shown the places
                    where<lb/> stood the houses of several distinguished char-<lb/>acters amongst
                    the Indians. <persName key="wwell1">Captain Wells</persName> also<lb/> took us
                    to the ground, where the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName><lb/>
                    reviewed his men, and gave them their orders<lb/> before going against the army
                    of <persName key="gstcl1">General St.<lb/> Clair</persName>. It is an extensive
                    plain near the river.<lb/><persName key="wwell1">Wells</persName> was then one
                    of the number, and says the<lb/><persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                    had one thousand four hundred<lb/> men; <persName key="gstcl1">St.
                        Clair's</persName> army consisted of a much larger<lb/> number, and were
                    about fifty miles distant at<lb/> the time. The <persName key="lturt1">Little
                        Turtle</persName> divided his men<lb/> into bands or messes, to each mess
                    twenty men.<lb/> It was the business of four of this number alter-<lb/>nately to
                    hunt for provisions. At 12 o'clock<lb/> each day it was the duty of the hunters
                    to re-<lb/>turn to the army with what they had killed. By<lb/> this regulation,
                    his warriors were well supplied<lb/> with provisions, during the seven day's in
                    which<lb/> they were advancing from this place to the field<lb/> of battle. It
                    is well known that at day break<lb/> the Indians commenced an unexpected
                    attack<lb/> upon <persName key="gstcl1">St. Clair's</persName> forces, killed
                    nine hundred of<lb/> his men, and put his whole army to flight.<lb/><persName
                        key="wwell1">Wells</persName> says, that only about thirty Indians were<lb/>
                    killed in the battle, and that about twenty died <lb/><pb n="66" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_066"/> afterwards of
                    their wounds. He also related<lb/> the following anecdote:</p>
                <p>A considerable altercation arose amongst the<lb/> Indians on the review ground,
                    relative to a<lb/> Commander-in-Chief. Some were in favor of<lb/>
                    <persName key="buckon1">Buckangehelas</persName>, a principal chief amongst the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, whilst others were in favor of the<lb/>
                    <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>. At length <persName
                        key="buckon1">Buckangehelas</persName> himself<lb/> decided the controversy
                    by yielding to the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/> Turtle</persName>, saying
                    that he was the youngest and most<lb/> active man, and that he preferred him to
                    him-<lb/>self. This reconciled the parties, and the <persName key="lturt1"
                        >Little<lb/> Turtle</persName> took the command.</p>
                <p>We also rode to view a prairie which extends<lb/> from the <geogName key="stmar"
                        >St. Mary's river</geogName> to the <geogName key="little">Little

                        >Wabash</geogName>. The distance from one<lb/> to the other is not more than
                    four miles, and<lb/> the highest ground is not more than five feet<lb/> above
                    the water in either river. The Indians<lb/> say that in high freshets they have
                    passed from<lb/> one water to the other in their canoes. A canal<lb/> might
                    easily be cut here, and at a small expense,<lb/> by which the waters of the
                    lakes and the waters<lb/> of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, (and of
                    course the <geogName key="missi">Mississippi</geogName>)<lb/> would be
                    connected. An abundance of furs<lb/> and skins taken on the waters of the
                        <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> and<lb/> the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>, are brought up the latter river in<lb/> boats by the
                    Canadians and the Indians, and<lb/> thence taken across a portage of eight miles
                    to<lb/> the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName> of the Lakes,* <note

                <p>After spending some time in viewing the re-<lb/>mains of several old Indian
                    towns, graves, hiero-<lb/>glyphics, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., we returned to
                        <persName key="wwell1">William<lb/> Wells</persName>' house, where we dined,

                <p>Paid a visit to the carpenter and black-<lb/>smith who accompanied us as before
                    mentioned.<lb/> They are both at work. The blacksmith is re-<lb/>pairing Indian
                    guns, and the carpenter is at<lb/> work upon a council house which the
                    govern-<lb/>ment has ordered to be built for the Indians at<lb/> their request.
                    The house is to be built of hewn<lb/> logs, fifty feet in length, and
                    twenty-five in width.<lb/> We also amused ourselves in attending to the<lb/>
                    manner of packing furs and skins. Our friend<lb/> Jonathan has several Canadians
                    now employed<lb/> in that business. They are packed by a ma-<lb/>chine
                    constructed for the purpose, by which the<lb/> work is performed expeditiously.
                    The packs<lb/> are made in squares of about two and a half feet,<lb/> and
                    contain from thirty-five to forty deer skins,<lb/> or about two hundred raccoon

                    and<lb/> were met by the following chiefs:</p>
                <p><persName key="obass1">O-bas-se-a, (or the Fawn,)</persName> a village chief
                    of<lb/> great distinction in the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName>
                    nation.</p>
                <p><persName key="osso1">Os-so-mit</persName>, a village chief of the <orgName

                        >Miami</orgName> nation.</p>
                <p>They were attended by a considerable num-<lb/>ber of their principal young men,
                    and by several<lb/> women.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> was not present. He had<lb/>
                    informed us on taking leave, that circumstances<lb/> required him to return to
                    his town, and that the<lb/> distance would be too great for him to return
                    in<lb/> time to meet us, his infirmities occasioning him<lb/> to travel slowly,
                    but that he would send his<lb/> brother, who would report to him faithfully
                    all<lb/> the proceedings of the council.</p>
                <p>After we had taken each other by the hand,<lb/> the chiefs took their seats by

                    according to the rank or distinction which<lb/> they held. After them, their
                    young men in<lb/> circular order, seat after seat,- and lastly, the<lb/> women,-
                    who occupied seats separate from the<lb/> men, being placed near the centre of

                <pb n="69" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_069"/>
                <p>We took our seats on the opposite side of the<lb/> house and in front of the
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>Being all thus seated- I speak literally, when<lb/> I say my heart palpitated- I
                    felt the importance<lb/> and dignity of our mission; I wished our heads<lb/>
                    were wiser, and feared for the result of so in-<lb/>teresting an
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>After a few minutes had passed, the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/>

                    us of the difficulty there was in<lb/> convening the Indians at so early a
                    period in<lb/> the season, and that those of their people then<lb/> present with
                    him were all who were likely to<lb/> attend to listen to what we had to say.</p>
                <p>We then proposed that the letter from our<lb/> friends and brothers at home, read
                    to the <persName key="fmeda1">Five<lb/> Medals</persName> and the <persName

                <p>This proposal was deemed proper, and the<lb/> letter was accordingly read.</p>
                <p>After a short pause, we addressed them as<lb/> follows:</p>

                        <p>Brothers: After that letter was read, our<lb/> hearts were filled with so
                            much love for our Red<lb/> Brethren, that, on looking over and
                            considering<lb/> the business upon which we had come, we felt<lb/> a
                            desire to see as many together as could be<lb/> convened- and this day
                            was that agreed upon<lb/> for us to meet you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We believed that the things we<lb/> had to say were of great
                            importance to our Red<lb/> Brethren, and therefore it was that we
                            request-<lb/>ed to see you together, that you all might have<lb/> an
                            opportunity of hearing what we have to say.</p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_071"/>
                        <p>Brothers: Our hearts are filled with thank-<lb/>fulness to the Great
                            Spirit, that He has<lb/> brought us safely to the country of our
                            Red<lb/> Brethren, and protected us through the journey.<lb/> We also
                            rejoice that He has given us this oppor-<lb/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<lb/> hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: It is now a little more than two<lb/> years since your Brothers
                            of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> had an<lb/> opportunity
                            of becoming acquainted with the<lb/><persName key="fmeda1">Five
                                Medals</persName>, the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                    Turtle</persName>, <persName key="topin1">Tuthinipee</persName>,
                            and<lb/> some other chiefs. They were glad of that op-<lb/>portunity of
                            having a talk with them, and of<lb/> enquiring after the situation of
                            their Red<lb/> Brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We had for some time entertain-<lb/>ed apprehensions, that the
                            many changes which<lb/> were taking place in circumstances, must
                            greatly<lb/> change the situation of our Red Brethren, and<lb/> that the
                            time was fast approaching, in which it<lb/> would be necessary for them
                            to alter their mode<lb/> of living.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: After our talk with the chiefs<lb/> whom we have just
                            mentioned, we were fully con-<lb/>vinced that the time was come, in
                            which our Red<lb/> Brethren ought to begin to cultivate their
                            lands;<lb/> that they ought to raise corn and other grain,<lb/> also
                            horses, cows, sheep, hogs, and other animals.<lb/> We then proposed to
                            afford them some assist-<lb/>ance. They appeared to be glad of the
                            proposal,<lb/><pb n="72" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_072"/> and informed that many of their people
                            were<lb/> disposed to turn heir attention to the cultiva-<lb/>tion of
                            the earth. They also expressed a desire<lb/> to be assisted by their
                            Brothers of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: Having been encouraged by the<lb/> opportunity which we then
                            had, we sent to the<lb/> care of the Agent for Indian Affairs some
                            ploughs,<lb/> harness for horses, axes, hoes, and other imple-<lb/>ments
                            of husbandry, which were made for the<lb/> use of our Red Brethren, and
                            desired that they<lb/> might be distributed amongst them as tokens
                            of<lb/> our friendship.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We received last fall, through<lb/> the hands of the Agent for
                            Indian Affairs, a<lb/> talk from the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                Turtle</persName>, the <persName key="fmeda1">Five
                            Medals</persName>,<lb/> and others, informing us that they had
                            received<lb/> the implements of husbandry, and requested<lb/> that their
                            Brothers of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> would
                            send<lb/> some of their people into the country of their<lb/> Red
                            Brethren for the purpose of seing their<lb/> situation, and showing them
                            how to make use of<lb/> the tools, saying they did not know how to<lb/>
                            begin. </p>
                        <p>Brothers: It is for these purposes that we<lb/> have now come; and we
                            again repeat, that we<lb/> rejoice we have the opportunity of seeing
                            you,<lb/> and of taking you by the hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: In coming into the country of our<lb/> Red Brethren, we have
                            come with our eyes open.<lb/> And although we are affected with sorrow,
                            in<lb/> believing that many of the Red Brethren suffer<lb/><pb n="73" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_073"/>
                            much for the want of food and for the want of<lb/> clothing, yet our
                            hearts have been made glad, in<lb/> seeing that it has pleased the Great
                            Spirit to<lb/> give you a rich and valuable country. Because<lb/> we
                            know that it is out of the earth that food<lb/> and clothing come. We
                            are sure, brothers, that<lb/> with but little labor and attention, you
                            may raise<lb/> much more corn and other grain than will be<lb/>
                            necessary for yourselves, your women and chil-<lb/>dren, and may also,
                            with great ease, raise many<lb/> more horses, cows, sheep, hogs and
                            other valuable<lb/> animals, than will be necessary for your own
                            use.<lb/> We are also confident, that if you will pursue<lb/> our method
                            in the cultivation of your land, you<lb/> will live in much greater ease
                            and plenty,<lb/> and<lb/> with much less fatigue and toil, than
                            attend<lb/> hunting, for a subsistence.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We are fully convinced, that if<lb/> you will adopt our mode of
                            cultivating the earth,<lb/> and of raising useful animals, you will find
                            it to<lb/> be a mode of living, not only far more plentiful<lb/> and
                            much less fatiguing, but also much more<lb/> certain, and which will
                            expose your bodies less<lb/> to the inclemencies of the weather than is
                            now<lb/> attendant upon hunting. It will lead you,<lb/> brothers, to
                            have fixed homes. You will build<lb/> comfortable dwelling-houses for
                            yourselves, your<lb/> women and children, where you may be
                            shelter-<lb/>ed from the rain, from the frost, and from the<lb/> snow,
                            and where you may enjoy in plenty the<lb/> rewards of your labors.</p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_074"/>
                        <p>Brothers: In laying these things before<lb/> you, we have no other motive
                            than a desire of<lb/> heart for the improvement, the benefit and
                            the<lb/> welfare of our Red Brethren- and therefore it<lb/> is that we
                            speak with freedom, and we hope,<lb/> that what we have to say, will go
                            in at one ear,<lb/> and not come out the other, but that it will be<lb/>
                            remembered by our Red Brethren. For we<lb/> know, brothers, that we
                            shall not be ashamed of<lb/> what we say, when, in time to come, you
                            com-<lb/>pare the things we are saying to you with your<lb/> experience
                            in practising them.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We will here mention, that the<lb/> time was, when the
                            forefathers of your brothers,<lb/> the white people, lived beyond the
                            great water,<lb/> in the same manner that our Red Brethren now<lb/>
                            live. The winters can yet be counted when<lb/> they went almost naked,
                            when they procured their<lb/> living by fishing, and by the bow and
                            arrow in<lb/> hunting- and when they lived in houses no bet-<lb/>ter
                            than yours. They were encouraged by some<lb/> who came from the
                            sun-rising, and lived amongst<lb/> them, to change their mode of living.
                            They<lb/> did change- they cultivated the earth, and we<lb/> are sure
                            the change was a happy one.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We are not ashamed<lb/> to acknowledge that the
                            time was when our fore-<lb/>fathers rejoiced at finding a wild plumb
                            tree, or<lb/> at killing a little game, and that they wandered<lb/> up
                            and down, living on the uncertain supplies<lb/> of fishing and hunting.
                            But, brothers, for your <lb/><pb n="75" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_075"/> encouragement, we now mention
                            that, by turn-<lb/>ing their attention to the cultivation of the<lb/>
                            earth, instead of the plumb tree, they soon had<lb/> orchards of many
                            kinds of good fruits- instead<lb/> of wild game, they soon had large
                            numbers of<lb/> cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, and other valuable<lb/>
                            animals,- and in many places, instead of their<lb/> forests, they had
                            large fields of corn and other<lb/> grain, as also many other valuable
                            productions<lb/> of the earth.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We hope your eyes will be open<lb/> to see clearly, the things
                            which are best for you,<lb/> and that you will desire to pursue them.
                            We<lb/> believe, brothers, that it is in the heart of your<lb/> father,
                            the President of the United States, to<lb/> assist his red children in
                            the cultivation of the<lb/> earth, and to render them services which
                            will be<lb/> greatly for their benefit and welfare. We hope<lb/> that
                            your exertions to change your present mode<lb/> of living will be so
                            plain to him, that he will<lb/> see them. This will encourage him to
                            continue<lb/> to aid you, in your endeavors.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have spoken plainly; we de-<lb/>sire to speak plainly. We
                            will now tell you<lb/> that we have not come merely to talk to you.<lb/>
                            We have come prepared to render you a little<lb/> assistance. Our
                            beloved brother, <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>,<lb/>
                            who is now present, has come along with us.<lb/> His desire is to
                            cultivate for you a field of corn;<lb/> also, to show you how to raise
                            some of the other<lb/> productions of the earth. He knows how to
                            use<lb/><pb n="76" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_076"/> the plough, the hoe, the axe, and other
                            imple-<lb/>ments of husbandry.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we here ask you, are you still de-<lb/>sirous to be instructed
                            by us, in the cultivation<lb/> of your lands? If you say you are, our
                            brother,<lb/> whom we have just mentioned, will continue<lb/> with you
                            during the summer. We shall leave<lb/> it to you to show him the spot
                            where to begin<lb/> to work.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, he has left a farm, he has left a<lb/> wife, and five small
                            children, who are very dear<lb/> to him; he has come from a sincere
                            desire to be<lb/> useful to our red brothers. His motives are<lb/> pure,
                            he will ask no reward from you, for his<lb/> services, his greatest
                            reward will be in the satis-<lb/>faction he will feel in finding you
                            inclined to<lb/> take hold of the same tools which he takes hold<lb/>
                            of, to receive from him instruction in the culti-<lb/>vation of your
                            lands, and to pursue the example<lb/> he will set you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we hope you will make the situa-<lb/>tion of our brother as
                            comfortable as circum-<lb/>stances will admit. We hope, also, that
                            many<lb/> of your young men will be willing to be taught<lb/> by him, to
                            use the plough, the hoe, and other<lb/> implements of husbandry. For we
                            are sure,<lb/> brothers, that as you take hold of such tools as<lb/> are
                            in the hands of the white people, you will<lb/> find them to be to you
                            like having additional<lb/> hands. You will also find that by using
                            them,<lb/><pb n="77" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_077"/> they will enable you to do many things
                            which,<lb/> without them, cannot be performed.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, there is one thing more which we<lb/> wish to add. The white
                            people, in order to get<lb/> their land cultivated, find it necessary
                            that their<lb/> young men should be employed in it, and not<lb/> their
                            women. Women are less than men. They<lb/> are not as strong as men. They
                            are not as able<lb/> to endure fatigue as men. It is the business
                            of<lb/> our women to be employed in our houses, to<lb/> keep them clean,
                            to sew, to knit, spin, and<lb/> weave, to dress food for themselves and
                            families,<lb/> to make clothes for the men and the rest of their<lb/>
                            families, to keep the clothes of their families<lb/> clean, and to take
                            care of their children. </p>
                        <p>Brothers, we desire not to mention too many<lb/> things to you, but we
                            must add a little further.<lb/> We are fully convinced that if you will
                            turn your<lb/> attention to the cultivation of the earth, to
                            rais-<lb/>ing the different kinds of grain, to erecting mills<lb/> for
                            grinding grain, to building comfortable dwell-<lb/>ing houses for your
                            families, to raising useful<lb/> animals- amongst others, sheep, for the
                            advan-<lb/>tage of the wool, in making clothing- to raising<lb/> flax
                            and hemp for your linen; and your young<lb/> women learn to spin and

                            present,<lb/> and that your numbers will increase, and not<lb/> continue
                            to diminish. As we observed,<lb/> brothers, your land is good. It is far
                            better<lb/> than the land the white people near the great<lb/><pb n="78" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_078"/> water cultivate. We are persuaded that your<lb/> land will produce
                            double the quantity of any<lb/> kind of grain, or of flax, or of hemp,
                            with the<lb/> same labor necessary near the great water. </p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We shall now end<lb/> what we have to say, with
                            informing you that<lb/>all the corn, and other productions of the
                            earth,<lb/> which <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName> may

                        <p>Brothers, it appears to me to be necessary<lb/> that I should give you an
                            immediate answer, as<lb/> you are about to return to your families
                            from<lb/> whence you came.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends, we are all pleased<lb/> to see you here, and to
                            take our brothers, the<lb/> Quakers, through you by the hand. We
                            re-<lb/>joice that the Great Spirit has appointed that<lb/> we should
                            this day meet. For we believe, that<lb/> this meeting will be of the
                            utmost consequence<lb/> to your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, what you have said, we have care-<lb/>fully gathered up, we
                            have placed it in our hearts,<lb/> in order that it may be communicated
                            to our<lb/> posterity. We are convinced that what you<lb/> have said is
                            for the good of your red brethren.<lb/> We are also convinced that our
                            chiefs and war-<lb/>riors, our women and children will be all of our
                            <lb/><pb n="80" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_080"/> opinion, and will be glad when they have
                            heard<lb/> what you have said.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we take you now by the hand, and<lb/> through you we take the
                            people who sent you<lb/> here by the hand, and assure you we are
                            pleased<lb/> that the Great Spirit has let us see each other,<lb/> and
                            converse together upon the subjects which<lb/> you have communicated to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you see there is not a large num-<lb/>ber of us here. What you
                            have said to us will<lb/> not remain with those who are here alone.
                            It<lb/> will be communicated to all your red brethren<lb/> in this
                            country. And I again repeat, that I am<lb/> convinced they will be glad
                            to hear what you<lb/> have said to us, to our women and children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, when we saw you with the rest of<lb/> our brothers in
                                <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, upwards of two
                            years<lb/> ago, I expect you recollect perfectly the conver-<lb/>sation
                            between us at that time and place. I,<lb/> there with my brother chiefs,
                            told you that we<lb/> were glad to find you so much disposed to
                            assist<lb/> us, our women and children. We told you that<lb/> your good
                            wished should be made known to all<lb/> your red brethren in this
                            country, which has<lb/> been done.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, ever since that time, I, as well as<lb/> some others of my
                            brother chiefs, have been en-<lb/>deavoring to turn the minds of our
                            people to-<lb/>wards the cultivation of the earth, but I am<lb/> sorry
                            to say we have not yet been able to effect<lb/> any thing.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_081"/>
                        <p>Brothers, there are so few of our chiefs now<lb/> present, it would not
                            be proper for us to under-<lb/>take to give a pointed answer to your
                            talk. We<lb/> expect that in a few moons there will be many<lb/> of our
                            people together. At that time it will be<lb/> proper that we should
                            return an answer to all<lb/> the subjects you now mention to us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, the things you have said to us re-<lb/>quire the greatest
                            attention. It appears to me<lb/> to be really necessary to deliberate
                            upon them.<lb/> In order to do so, we must beg to leave the paper<lb/>
                            upon which they are written, that we may com-<lb/>municate them to our
                            chiefs when they assemble.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, all the words which you have said<lb/> to-day were certainly
                            calculated for our good.<lb/> You have enumerated to us the different
                            kinds<lb/> of grain and animals we ought to raise for our<lb/> comfort.
                            You have told us that if we all adopt<lb/> the plan you have proposed,
                            we should want for<lb/> nothing. This, brothers, myself and many of
                            our<lb/> people believe is true, and we hope we shall<lb/> finally be
                            able to convince our young men that<lb/> this is the plan we ought to
                            adopt to get our<lb/> living.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you have come a long distance to<lb/> render service to us. We
                            hope that you will<lb/> meet with the success you wish, you have
                            been<lb/> very particular in pointing out to us what will<lb/> be for
                            our good. You have also been very par-<lb/>ticular in pointing out to us
                            the duties of our<lb/> women, and you have told us that in adopting<lb/>
                            <pb n="82" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_082"/> your mode of living, our numbers would increase<lb/> and
                            not diminish. In all this I perfectly agree<lb/> with you. And I hope
                            the other chiefs will<lb/> also agree with you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are pleased to hear you say<lb/> you are going to leave one
                            of your brothers with<lb/> us, to show us in what manner you cultivate
                            the<lb/> earth. We shall endeavor, brothers, to make<lb/> his situation
                            amongst us as agreeable to him as<lb/> will be possible for us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are convinced that the plan<lb/> you propose will be highly
                            advantageous to your<lb/> red brethren. We are also convinced that
                            you<lb/> have observed very justly that we shall not then<lb/> be liable
                            to sickness. We are certain that we<lb/> shall then be able to make a
                            more comfortable<lb/> living with less labor than at present. And I<lb/>
                            hope that this will be the opinion of us all.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, assure your people who sent you<lb/> here, tell your old chiefs
                            that we are obliged to<lb/> them for their friendly offers to assist us
                            in<lb/> changing our present mode of living; tell them<lb/> that it is a
                            work which cannot be done immediate-<lb/><pb n="83" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_083"/>ly,- that we are
                            that way disposed, and we hope<lb/> it will take place gradually.</p>

                        <p>Brothers, my heart is so overjoyed and<lb/> warmed with what you have
                            said, that I find I<lb/> had forgot to mention one of the most
                            important<lb/> things.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, at the time we first met at this<lb/> place, the <persName
                                key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> and myself formed some<lb/> idea
                            of your business. We expected you had<lb/> come to do for us the things
                            you had proposed<lb/> to us when in <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>. We consulted each<lb/> other upon the answer
                            necessary to return to<lb/> you in every respect, and I now find that
                            our<lb/> idea was right.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, the sentiments which I have de-<lb/>livered to you were his
                            sentiments. You have<lb/> now told us, that your brother has a mind
                            to<lb/> live amongst us to show us how to cultivate the<lb/> earth, and
                            have desired us to show him the spot<lb/> where to begin. We agreed
                            then, that he should<lb/> be at neither of our villages, lest our
                            younger<lb/> brothers should be jealous of our taking him to<lb/>
                            ourselves. We have determined to place him<lb/> on the <geogName
                                key="wabas">Waash</geogName>, where some of our families will<lb/>
                            follow him,-where our young men I hope will<lb/> flock to him, and where
                            he will be able to in-<lb/>struct them as he wished. This is all I have
                            to<lb/> say. I could all day repeat the sentiments I<lb/> have already
                            expressed; also how much I have<lb/><pb n="84" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_084"/> been gratified in
                            seeing and hearing my brothers;<lb/> but that is not necessary. I am
                            sorry, brothers,<lb/> that the chiefs of our country are not all
                            present,<lb/> that they might all hear what you have said, and<lb/> have
                            an opportunity of talking to you.</p>

                <p>At the close of this speech we were informed<lb/> that nothing would be added by

                        Turtle</persName>.<lb/> We then told them that the words spoken by<lb/> the
                        <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> should be carefully
                    carried<lb/> home to our brothers and friends who had sent<lb/> us. We also
                    informed them that notwithstanding<lb/> we were now desirous to return to our
                    homes as<lb/> soon as possible, yet we wished to see the place<lb/> which they
                    designed to be the station of our<lb/> brother, <persName key="pdeni1">Philip
                        Dennis</persName>, and hoped some of them<lb/> would show it to us. We
                    further added, that<lb/> this did not arise from any jealousy in our<lb/> minds
                    that the place fixed upon was not suitable.<lb/> On the contrary, we had no
                    doubt that they had<lb/> judged wisely; but that the love and respect<lb/> which
                    we bore to our brother, led us to desire to<lb/> bear him company to the place,
                    and also to ren-<lb/>der him every assistance in our power before we<lb/> left
                    him.</p>
                <p>They then informed us that they would con-<lb/>sult and fix upon some one to go
                    with us. The<lb/> business of the council being then at an end, we<lb/> in turn
                    rose from our seats, and shook hands<lb/> with them, which concluded the
                    formalities of<lb/> the opportunity. After entering into a little<lb/><pb n="85" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_085"/> conversation, we told them we should now bid<lb/> them farewell, as we
                    expected we should not see<lb/> them again. They then took us separately by<lb/>
                    the hand, and with marks of great affection and<lb/> friendship bade us
                    farewell, and we returned to<lb/> our quarters.</p>

                        >Mas-<lb/>sanonga, (or Clear Sky,)</persName> a handsome young man<lb/> of

                <p>After riding eight miles, we came to the place<lb/> called the <placeName
                        key="port">Portage</placeName>, on the <geogName key="little">Little
                        river</geogName>, a navigable<lb/> water of the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>. Then down the margin<lb/> of the river, leaving it to
                    our left. At the end<lb/> of four miles, crossed <geogName key="sandy">Sandy
                        Creek</geogName>, another navi-<lb/>gable water of the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>; then proceeded<lb/> through the woods, and at the end of
                    thirteen<lb/> miles further again came to <geogName key="little">Little
                        river</geogName>, at a<lb/> place called the <geogFeat key="sadd"
                        >Saddle</geogFeat>. This name is derived<lb/> from a large rock in the bed
                    of the river in the<lb/> shape of a saddle. From the <geogFeat key="sadd"
                        >Saddle</geogFeat> we pro-<lb/>ceeded six miles along the margin of the
                    river<lb/> to its junction with the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>.</p>
                <p>The bed of the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> here is of limestone.<lb/>
                    After riding five miles further, we came to a<lb/><pb n="86" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_086"/> vein of land
                    about one mile in width, the sur-<lb/>face of which is covered with small flint
                    stones,<lb/> and which we are told extends for several miles.<lb/>On examining
                    these flints, we found them of<lb/> excellent quality.</p>
                <p>Here the Indians supply themselves with flints<lb/> for their guns and for other
                    purposes, and here<lb/> formerly they procured their darts. It has
                    cer-<lb/>tainly been a place abundantly resorted to from<lb/> time immemorial.
                    This is evident from the sur-<lb/>face of the ground being dug in holes of two
                    and<lb/> three feet in depth, over nearly the whole tract.<lb/> This flinty vein
                    is called by the Indians <geogName key="fathf">Father<lb/> Flint</geogName>.
                    They have a tradition concerning its<lb/> origin which is very incredible. From
                    this we<lb/> proceeded, and after riding two miles, reached<lb/> the place
                    proposed by the Indians.</p>
                <p>This place is thirty-two miles rather south of<lb/> west from <placeName
                        key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, and is situated on the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, at a place called the Boat-yard,
                    which<lb/> name it obtained from the circumstance of<lb/>
                    <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson</persName> having built some flat,<lb/>
                    bottomed boats here, for the purpose of tran-<lb/>sporting some of the baggage
                    of the American<lb/> troops down the river. It was formerly the seat<lb/> of an
                    Indian town of the <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, and we are<lb/>
                    pleased to find there are about twenty-five acres<lb/> of land clear. The
                        <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> here makes a beau-<lb/>tiful
                    appearance, and is about sixty yards wide.<lb/> A little above is an island in
                    the river, on one<lb/> side of which the water runs with a strong cur-<lb/><pb n="87" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_087"/>rent, and affords a good mill seat. We viewed<lb/> the land in this
                    neighborhood for a considerable<lb/> distance, and found it high and of
                    superior<lb/> quality, being covered with sugar trees of enor-<lb/>mous size,
                    black walnut, white walnut, hack-<lb/>berry, blue ash, oak buckeye trees,
                    &amp;c., all very<lb/> large. The land appears to be equal in quality<lb/> to
                    any we have seen, not excepting the bottoms<lb/> of the <geogName key="sciot"
                        >Scioto</geogName> and <geogName key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogName>. About
                    half a<lb/> mile below, a handsome creek falls into the river<lb/> from the
                    north, which we traced for a consider-<lb/>able distance, and are convinced it
                    affords a good<lb/> mill seat. This creek bearing no name, we called<lb/> it
                        <geogName key="dennc">Dennis' Creek</geogName> in honor of <persName
                        key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>. </p>
                <p>As night approached, <persName key="clear1">Massanonga</persName>, taking
                    his<lb/> knife, left us, and in about fifteen minutes re-<lb/>turned with a
                    remarkably fine turkey. This he<lb/> prepared and roasted for us in a very nice
                    and<lb/> expeditious manner, on which we fared sumptu-<lb/>ously. At 9 o'clock
                    we wrapped ourselves in<lb/> our blankets, and laid down to sleep before
                    the<lb/> fire, having no shelter. The night was frosty;<lb/> we, however, slept
                    tolerably and took no cold.</p>
                <p>In the night the otters were very noisy along<lb/> the river, the deer also
                    approached our fire and<lb/> made a whistling noise; the wolves howled, and<lb/>
                    at the dawn of day turkies gobbled in all direct-<lb/>tions.</p>

                    for <persName key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>' farm; we also staked out
                    the<lb/> situation for his wigwam, which is about one<lb/> hundred feet from the
                    banks of the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, and<lb/> opposite to a
                    fine spring of excellent water issuing<lb/> out of the bank of the river.</p>
                <p>We are told by several persons well acquainted<lb/> with the country, that from
                    hence to <placeName key="stvin">St. Vin-<lb/>cennes</placeName>, on the
                        <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, a distance of two hun-<lb/>dred
                    miles by land, and three hundred and fifty<lb/> by water, the land on both sides
                    of the river<lb/> embracing a very extensive width, is not inferior<lb/> to the
                    description given of this location in yes-<lb/>terday's notes.</p>
                <p>At <placeName key="missi1">Mississinaway</placeName>, a large Indian town of the<lb/>

                <p>There are no Indians between this and <placeName key="fwayn">Fort<lb/>

                    dis-<lb/>tant. Whilst here we have seen four peroques<lb/> loaded with peltry,

                    tran-<lb/>sported to <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>.</p>
                <p>I may here observe that the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> affords<lb/>
                    an abundance of large turtles, called soft shelled<lb/> turtles, the outer coat
                    being a hard skin, rather<lb/> than a shell. They are esteemed excellent
                    food.<lb/> It affords a great variety of fine fish, and<lb/><pb n="89" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_089"/> we saw
                    ducks in abundance; we are told it is re-<lb/>sorted to by geese and swans.</p>
                <p>About 8 o'clock in the morning we set out<lb/> for <placeName key="fwayn">Fort

                <p>I may here observe that some days ago<lb/> we came to a conclusion to return home
                    by the<lb/> way of the lakes; to this we have been induced<lb/> from a hope that

                    retrace<lb/> the way by which we came; and I may also<lb/> add, that we have
                    been encouraged to this by<lb/> the advice of our kind friends heretofore
                    named,<lb/> who have with much apparent cheefulness<lb/> offered to prepare a

                <p>This morning we bade both a joyful<lb/> and sorrowful farewell to <persName
                        key="pdeni1">Philip Dennis</persName>, and<lb/> the two young men who
                    accompanied us out.<lb/> We also took leave of those generally with whom<lb/> we
                    had formed an acquaintance, first breakfast-<lb/>ing with <persName key="awhip1"
                        >Captain Whipple</persName>, whose hearty kind-<lb/>ness to us has been so
                    often repeated, that his<lb/> name will deservedly claim a place in our

                    manned it with a corporal and private<lb/> soldier from the fort; and, joined by

                    superabundant supply both for eating<lb/> and drinking.</p>
                <p>About 8 o'clock we embarked for <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>,
                    pro-<lb/>ceeded about thirty miles down the <geogName key="miamr"
                        >Miami</geogName> of the<lb/> lakes, and in the evening encamped under a
                    tent<lb/> near the margin of the river. With respect to<lb/> the appearance of
                    the country, the same old<lb/> phrase must be continued; <q>land of
                        excellent<lb/> quality.</q> We several times went ashore to view<lb/> the
                    river bottoms, they were extensive and ap-<lb/>peared to be first rate land. The
                    timber, buck<lb/> eye, ash, elm, sugar tree, oak, hickory, black<lb/> and white
                    walnut, &amp;c. We saw ducks in abun-<lb/>dance, and <persName>Corporal
                        King</persName> says they breed here<lb/> in great numbers. This river
                    affords a variety<lb/> of fine fish, and mostly of descriptions very
                    dif-<lb/>ferent from those found in our salt waters. Of<lb/> these the following
                    are some of the names;<lb/> black, yellow, and white bass, covers,
                    pickerel,<lb/> suckers, herrings, muscanago, gar, pike, catfish,<lb/>
                    sheeps-head, carp, and sturgeon. These are all<lb/> caught with the hook except
                    the two last.</p>
                <p>The sturgeon are now on their way from the<lb/> lake to the head waters of the

                        >Little Turtle</persName><lb/> very humorously proposed to <persName
                        key="jjohn2">Johnson</persName> a project,<lb/> which was to join in
                    building a stone dam at the<lb/> junction of the two rivers, to prevent the
                    sturgeon<lb/> from getting back again to the lake, and then said<lb/> he <said
                        who="lturt1">you and I will live on them this summer.</said></p>
                <p>We observed to-day (<date when="1804-04-15">15th,</date>) several hunting<lb/>
                    and sugar camps, and went on shore to visit two<lb/> of the latter. The camps
                    were well supplied<lb/> with jerk venison, dried raccoon, sturgeon,
                    &amp;c.;<lb/> one man only was at the camp, and he was em-<lb/>ployed with his
                    knife in making a paddle for his<lb/> canoe. A squaw was knitting a bag, and
                    an-<lb/>other was preparing the bark of the buckeye for<lb/> thread, strings,
                    &amp;c., by beating it with a piece<lb/> of wood. We saw amongst them several
                    fat and<lb/> healthy looking children, who were playful and<lb/> did not appear
                    to be afraid of us. The children<lb/> presented us with a quarter of fresh
                    venison, for<lb/> which we returned them some salt meat and bis-<lb/>cuit, with
                    which they were pleased. Here we<lb/> saw a child about six months old fixed to
                    a board<lb/> in the genuine Indian fashion. The board was<lb/> straight, about
                    fifteen inches in width, and two<lb/> and a half feet in length, having at its
                    head a<lb/> circular handle, and at the foot a small ledge<lb/> To this the
                    child was lashed by cloth bandages,<lb/> and so tight that it could not move
                    hand or foot.<lb/> The board was placed against a tree, almost
                    per-<lb/>pendicularly, and the infant asleep- of course in<lb/> a standing
                    position. The child was painted very<lb/><pb n="92" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_092"/> red, and had silver
                    bandages about its wrists,<lb/> and ornaments of the same metal in its
                    ears.<lb/> The Indians are very fond of their children, and<lb/> put about them
                    very costly silver ornaments.</p>
                <p>I have seen Indian children dressed in a calico<lb/> frock which was stuck with
                    silver broaches from<lb/> neck to heel, besides ornaments on the wrists,<lb/> in
                    the ear, and about the neck and head.</p>

                <p>Proceeded very pleasantly<lb/> down the river about fifty miles, and at
                    night<lb/> encamped under our tent. In the evening a<lb/> severe thunder gust
                    came on, with heavy rain,<lb/> which continued for several hours after
                    night,<lb/> but having a good tent we did not get much<lb/> wetted. In the
                    course of the day we saw wild<lb/> fowl in abundance, also passed by several
                    Indian<lb/> hunting and sugar camps. Our Corporal is very<lb/> fond of saluting
                    the camps with an imitation of<lb/> an Indian whoop, which they are sure to
                    answer<lb/> by a similar not. This whoop very nearly re-<lb/>sembles the shrill
                    yelp of a dog. The land ap-<lb/>pears to be of an excellent quality, and deer
                    and<lb/> turkies are very numerous. Here also<lb/>

                <p>Proceeded about thirty-five miles, and at<lb/> night encamped under our tent. We
                    have been<lb/> entertained to-day with a diversified scene. The<lb/> river
                    covered with wild fowl, fish jumping up<lb/> around us, and turkies flying.</p>
                <pb n="93" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_093"/>
                <p>We stopped a short time to view the remains<lb/> of <placeName key="fdefi">Fort
                        Defiance</placeName>. This fort was built by <persName key="gwayn1"
                        >Gene-<lb/>ral Wayne</persName>, in the course of his march to attack<lb/>
                    the Indians. The situation is very beautiful and<lb/> commanding, at the
                    junction of the river <geogName key="augl">Great<lb/> Au Glaize</geogName> with
                    the <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>. The two rivers<lb/> make a large
                    body of water, the width being<lb/> about two hundred yards. A Canadian
                    trader<lb/> only resides here. We also went on shore several<lb/> times to visit
                    Indian towns and camps. Great<lb/> numbers of Indians are settled upon the
                    banks<lb/> of the Miami; they are chiefly of the <orgName key="odawa"
                        >Ottoway</orgName><lb/> and <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>
                    tribes. They appeared pleased<lb/> at receiving visitors. Their children were
                    very<lb/> antic, and seemed to leap for joy on seeing us<lb/> land; doubtless
                    from a hope of receiving some<lb/> presents. The hunters are returning to
                    their<lb/> towns, and many of their wigwams are stocked<lb/> with peltry, dried
                    raccoon, and jerk venison.<lb/> They are on their way to the foot of the
                    rapids.<lb/> The women are mostly employed in knitting<lb/> bags and belts and
                    in making moccasins. A<lb/> considerable number of Indians are on the river<lb/>
                    in bark canoes loaded with peltry. They are on<lb/> the way to the foot of the
                    rapids and other places<lb/> for the purpose of exchanging their peltry
                    with<lb/> the traders for goods. Most of the wigwams we<lb/> have seen to-day
                    are covered with rushes sewed<lb/> together, which are procured from the shores of<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>, and so put together, that the
                    covering<lb/> will turn any fall of rain. An Indian house is<lb/><pb n="94" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_094"/>
                    constructed by putting two forks into the ground,<lb/> and a horizontal piece
                    from one fork to the<lb/> other. Upon this piece rest long pieces of bark,<lb/>
                    with the other end upon the earth at a conveni-<lb/>ent distance, thus
                    sheltering them from the<lb/> weather. Sometimes they make circular
                    wig-<lb/>wams, by putting small saplings into the ground<lb/> in circular order,
                    then bringing the other ends<lb/> to a point, they tie them together. These
                    they<lb/> either cover with bark or with the rush mats<lb/> before
                    described.</p>
                <p>To-day we passed a place called <placeName key="girtyt">Girty's
                    town</placeName>,<lb/> noted for the former residence of <persName key="sgirt1"

                <p>Proceeded about thirty-three miles. In<lb/> the earlier part of the day we passed
                    several<lb/> creeks and small streams, and at length reached<lb/> what is called
                    the head of the <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName>. The river is<lb/> here
                    about four hundred yards wide. The noise<lb/> of the falls informed us of our
                    approach, long be-<lb/>lieve that our peroque was manned by careful<lb/> hands,
                    we resolutely entered the <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName> and
                    de-<lb/>scended with great velocity down the fall for the<lb/> distance of
                    eighteen miles to the foot of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName>. The whole of this distance is a
                    continued<lb/> fall, the land falling with the same regularity,<lb/> and
                    generally elevated but a few feet above the<lb/> surface of the water. It is
                    needless to say that<lb/> we went swiftly down, when I add, that it is a<lb/>
                    trip occupying but one hour and a half.</p>
                <p>The bed of the river is a solid limestone rock,<lb/><pb n="95" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_095"/>At the foot of
                    the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName> we lodged all night at<lb/> the
                    house of a Canadian trader, who treated us<lb/> with great respect, and, though
                    a tavern-keeper,<lb/> would receive no pay from us for our supper,<lb/>
                    lodgings, or breakfast. A considerable encamp-<lb/>ment of Indians, who had come
                    to trade with<lb/> him was near his house. They were very merry<lb/> for a great
                    part of the night, keeping up a con-<lb/>tinued sound of their favorite
                    instruments of<lb/> music, amongst them the drum and fife. The<lb/> former is
                    made of part of the body of a hollow<lb/> tree, with the ends covered with deer
                    skin, upon<lb/> which they beat with sticks, the latter they<lb/> make of reed
                    into which they bore holes some-<lb/>what in imitation of a fife. The foot of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName> is rendered well known in American
                    his-<lb/>tory, as having been a place of frequent ren-<lb/>dezvous by the
                    Indians, previous to their defeat<lb/> by <persName key="gwayn1">General
                        Wayne</persName>. Here also the Indians burnt<lb/> many of the white men who
                    were taken prisoners<lb/> by them. To this place <persName key="gwayn1"
                        >Wayne</persName> marched, and<lb/> here he met and defeated the Indian
                    army.</p>
                <p>About eight miles above the foot of the <geogName key="miamr1"
                    >Rapids</geogName><lb/> and near the centre of the river, in a very rapid<lb/>
                    situation, is a noted rock called by the Cana-<lb/>dians, <geogName key="roche"
                        >Rochede Bout</geogName>, (or standing rock.) This<lb/> rock is about thirty
                    feet in height above the<lb/> surface of the water, and the same in
                    diameter.<lb/> The top has the regular appearance of the roof<lb/> of a house,
                    and the body of the rock is circular.<lb/> Its appearance is additionally
                    handsome from<lb/><pb n="96" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_096"/> the circumstance of the roof, as it is called,
                    being<lb/> covered with cedar. </p>
                <p>Fish are now passing up the <geogName key="miamir1">Rapids</geogName> in
                    great<lb/> numbers from the lakes, in so much that the water<lb/> smells
                    strongly of them. They are taken very<lb/> abundantly by the Canadians and
                    Indians. The<lb/> fisherman without seeing them strikes his barbed<lb/> spear to
                    the rocks, which often passes through<lb/> several at a time, and frequently of
                    different<lb/> kinds. The muscanonje are taken here in great<lb/> numbers; they
                    are a fish from three to five feet in<lb/> length.</p>

                <p>This morning we proceeded with diffi-<lb/>culty ten miles; owing to high winds,
                    and a rain<lb/>coming on, prudence seemed to dictate that we<lb/> should put
                    into a harbor, which we did at the<lb/> mouth of <geogName key="swanc">Swan
                        creek</geogName>, where is a small fort and<lb/> garrison lately established
                    by the United States.<lb/> Introductory letters were given us at <placeName

                        >Lieutenant Rhea</persName>, the Commandant,<lb/> which we delivered. He
                    treated us with respect,<lb/> and with him we spent the remainder of the
                    day<lb/> and lodged. On our way we stopped to view an<lb/> old fort, called
                        <placeName key="fmiam">Fort Miami</placeName>, which was garrisoned<lb/> by
                    the British at the time <persName key="gwayn1">Wayne</persName> defeated
                    the<lb/> Indians.</p>
                <p>Many Indian villages and wigwams are seated<lb/> on both shores of the river, and
                    many Canadian<lb/> traders are to be found residing amongst them.<lb/> They have
                    generally intermarried with the In-<lb/>dians, and adopted their manners. Some
                    of the<lb/><pb n="97" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_097"/> Indian houses which we passed to-day are built<lb/> of
                    small round logs, and are roofed with bark.<lb/> Near the mouth of <geogName
                        key="swanc">Swan creek</geogName> is an extensive<lb/> valley of which we
                    took a particular view. Here<lb/> the Indians placed their wives and children
                    at<lb/> the time they agreed to make battle with <persName key="gwayn1"
                        >Gene-<lb/>ral Wayne</persName>.</p>
                <p>The river increases in width from the foot of<lb/> the <geogName key="miamr1"
                        >Rapids</geogName> toward the lake. It is more than<lb/> half a mile wide
                    opposite <geogName key="swanc">Swan creek</geogName>, and at<lb/> present has
                    the appearance of tide water; a<lb/> strong east wind having brought a heavy
                    swell<lb/> from the lake, which has in a short time raised<lb/> the river more
                    than three feet in perpendicular<lb/> height. We saw to-day geese and swans
                    in<lb/> great abundance.</p>

                <p>This morning notwithstanding the very<lb/> unfavorable appearance of the weather,

                    <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>. We attempted to turn the point
                    in<lb/> order to enter the lake, but the situation being<lb/> bleak and the wind
                    high, occasioned a heavy<lb/><pb n="98" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_098"/> swell, and apprehending danger, we

                <p>About midnight the clouds dispersing,<lb/> wind becoming calm, and the moon
                    shining very<lb/> refulgently, we were encouraged again to embark,<lb/>
                    notwithstanding a considerable agitation of the<lb/> lake from the storm, and
                    were successful enough<lb/> to turn <placeName key="baypo">Bay

                        <placeName key="prais">Point Raisin</placeName>, near the mouth<lb/> of the
                        <geogName key="raisr">river Raisin</geogName>, (or Grape river,) making
                    a<lb/> distance of about twelve miles, when the wind<lb/> rising we made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to get<lb/> round the <placeName key="prais"
                        >Point</placeName>, and were again obliged to seek<lb/> a harbor and wait
                    for a calm. Shortly after we<lb/> had put into harbor a fish approached the
                    shore<lb/><pb n="99" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_099"/> very near to us and seemed to be at play. One<lb/> of
                    our men advanced toward it very cautiously,<lb/> and with an oar, gave it a blow
                    upon the tail,<lb/> which so disabled it that he caught it. We<lb/> found it to
                    be a muscanonje, measuring four feet<lb/> two inches in length and
                    proportionally thick.<lb/> The muscanonje is from head to tail very
                    beau-<lb/>tifully spotted, and is I think not inferior to any<lb/> fish I ever
                    tasted.</p>
                <p>For several days past we have been not a little<lb/> mortified at being confined
                    to a harbor, whilst<lb/> the Indians are passing us very frequently in<lb/>
                    their bark canoes. It is astonishing to see these<lb/> canoes riding large
                    swells without danger. It is<lb/> certain that they will ride waves whose
                    height<lb/> exceeds their length.</p>
                <p>Many of the bark canoes of the Indians have<lb/> fallen under our observation.
                    They are gene-<lb/>rally made of the bark of the birch tree, and<lb/> shaped
                    differently. We have seen bark canoes<lb/> loaded with two thousand five hundred
                    weight,<lb/> which were so light that two men could carry<lb/> them on their
                    shoulders with great ease. The<lb/> construction of the smaller description of
                    these<lb/> boats is so simple, that in an hour they will<lb/> have a canoe made
                    which will carry several per-<lb/>sons across their rivers. We have also seen
                    many<lb/> of their rafts. These are made for crossing<lb/> rivers at those
                    seasons of the year when it is not<lb/> easy to strip the bark from the trees.
                    In all the<lb/> river bottoms the buckeye wood is to be found.<lb/><pb n="100" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_100"/>
                    This they prefer for making a raft, on account<lb/> of its lightness when dried,
                    it being a wood nearly<lb/> as light as cork. The Indians tie together
                    small<lb/> logs of the buckeye wood, to form a square of<lb/> about five or six
                    feet, this they cross by pieces<lb/> of any other description of wood, confining
                    piece<lb/> to piece by bark strings, splits of hoop ash, &amp;c.<lb/> Upon a
                    raft of this description, three or four<lb/> persons will cross their rivers
                    even though the<lb/> currenthe against them.</p>
                <p>We had not been long in harbor, before our<lb/> anxiety to proceed exceeded our
                    patience, and<lb/> observing in view at an apparent distance of one<lb/> and a
                    half to two miles from us, about fifty<lb/> houses resembling a village, we
                    concluded to<lb/> abandon our peroque, walk to the settlement,<lb/> and then
                    endeavor to procure horses to take us<lb/> to <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit.</placeName></p>
                <p>At 11 o'clock this morning we set out for this<lb/> purpose, followed by our men
                    with our baggage<lb/> on their backs, and after walking over a wet<lb/> prairie,
                    through mud and water, half a leg and<lb/> more in depth, for the distance of
                    nearly six<lb/> miles, we reached the place. Viewing this set-<lb/>tlement from
                    the lake, and over a tract so level<lb/> that the elevation between it and us
                    did not ex-<lb/>ceed two feet, occasioned us to be so greatly de-<lb/>ceived in
                    the distance. On arriving we found<lb/> that, instead of a village, it was a
                    settlement of<lb/> French farmers situated along the <geogName key="raisr">river
                        Raisin</geogName>,<lb/> and presenting a very beautiful scene. The<lb/><pb n="101" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_101"/> farms contain from sixty to eighty acres, laid off<lb/> in
                    parallelograms. The buildings are good, and<lb/> the gardens and orchards
                    handsome. We un-<lb/>derstand that about two miles higher up the river<lb/>
                    there is another settlement composed of about<lb/> forty families, and upon
                        <geogName key="otterc">Otter Creek</geogName>, about four<lb/> miles
                    distant, a third settlement containing about<lb/> thirty families. These people
                    are Roman Ca-<lb/>tholics. We were soon informed that the dis-<lb/>tance from
                    here to <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName> was thirty-six miles<lb/> by
                    land, and that the road passed through so flat<lb/> and wet a country, for the
                    greater part of the<lb/> way, that at this season of the year, it was
                    almost<lb/> impossible to travel it on horseback, and were<lb/> advised to wait
                    on the wind for a passage by water.<lb/> We, therefore, concluded to take
                    lodgings at<lb/> the house of <persName key="jbedi1">John Bedient</persName>,
                    who has offered to<lb/> entertain us, and dispatched our men to the boat,<lb/>
                    with instructions to come up the <geogName key="raisr">river Raisin</geogName>
                    for<lb/> us, as soon as wind and weather permitted; being<lb/> so wearied and
                    overcome with our "Jack-o-Lan-<lb/>tern" excursion, that we could not consent
                    to<lb/> retrace our steps to the boat.</p>

                <p>A strong west wind, attended with heavy<lb/> rain last night and this day, have
                    prevented our<lb/> men from getting to us. It is a fact well-known<lb/> here,
                    that northwest and west winds are as certain<lb/> to produce cloudy weather as
                    easterly winds with<lb/> us. This is doubtless owing to the humidity of<lb/> the
                    vast western lakes. The same winds are<lb/> severely cold in winter, no doubt
                    from the im-<lb/><pb n="102" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_102"/>mense bodies of ice then accumulated upon

                <p>This morning our men arrived about 8<lb/> o'clock, with the peroque, the wind
                    having abated<lb/> and weather fair. We again embarked, and<lb/> on our way down
                    the <geogName key="raisr">river Raisin</geogName> were amused<lb/> with the
                    great numbers of wild geese, which<lb/> were at play in the ponds near the
                    margin of the<lb/> river. They feed here so undisturbedly, that<lb/> though we
                    were within gun shot of them, they<lb/> took but little notice of us. We again
                    entered<lb/> the <geogName key="lakee">lake</geogName>, and encouraged our men
                    to make the<lb/> best of its smooth surface. They proceeded with<lb/> great
                    industry, and at night we reached a <orgName key="wyandot">Wyan-<lb/>dot
                        town</orgName>, called <placeName key="browt">Brown's town</placeName>,
                    making a distance<lb/> of about thirty miles. Here we concluded to<lb/> lodge at
                    the house of <persName key="wwalk1">William Walker</persName>, who is<lb/>
                    interpreter for those of the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> nation
                    who<lb/> are settled on this side of the lake. He is<lb/> married to an Indian
                    woman who speaks good<lb/> English, and is very conversible. She gave us<lb/>
                    for supper bacon, bear's meat, and eggs fried,<lb/> also a dish of tea.</p>
                <p><placeName key="browt">Brownstown</placeName> is situated at the mouth of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="detror">Detroit river</geogName>, and on the American side. The<lb/>
                    <geogName key="detror">river Detroit</geogName> is a vast body of running
                    water.<lb/> Its mouth is two miles in width, and the water<lb/> passes out of it
                    into the lake with a strong cur-<lb/>rent. Its channel is wide, generally ten
                    fathoms<lb/> in depth, and in many places much deeper. The<lb/> name <geogName
                        key="detror">Detroit river</geogName> is a corruption. Detroit, a<lb/><pb n="103" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_103"/> French word, signifies the Strait, a name much<lb/> more appropos,
                    it being but an outlet from the<lb/> waters of the western lakes to <geogName
                        key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>.</p>

                <p>This morning our curiosity led us to<lb/> take a view of <placeName key="browt"
                        >Brownstown</placeName>. The village contains<lb/> about one hundred houses,
                    which are generally<lb/> built of small round logs, and roofed with elm<lb/>
                    bark. These Indians cultivate a considerable<lb/> quantity of corn, and their
                    fields are enclosed<lb/> with rails of their own splitting. We saw a<lb/> sample
                    of the wheat which they had raised the<lb/> last season, which looked well. They
                    have gar-<lb/>dens and a considerable number of fruit trees.<lb/> They have a
                    small number of cattle, and raise a<lb/> large number of hogs. The interpreter
                    says they<lb/> are greatly disposed to civilization, and have re-<lb/>quested of
                    the United States to furnish them<lb/> this year with cattle, instead of goods
                    or money<lb/> for their annuity.</p>
                <p>After taking breakfast, we again embarked<lb/> and proceeded up the <geogName
                        key="detror">river Detroit</geogName>, passing by<lb/> another Indian town
                    called <placeName key="walkv">Walk-in-the-Water<lb/> village</placeName>, a name
                    derived from the principal chief<lb/> of the settlement. The village contains
                    about<lb/> twenty houses, and bears the same civilized ap-<lb/>pearance as
                        <placeName key="browt">Brownstown</placeName>.</p>
                <p>After passing the <geogName key="lecas">river Le Cas</geogName> and the <geogName
                        key="rangr">river<lb/> Range</geogName>, we came opposite to a British

                <pb n="104" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_104"/>
                <p>The white settlements, on both the American<lb/> and British shores of the
                        <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, are so near<lb/> together, that

                        >Sandwich</placeName> is <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, which
                    we<lb/> reached about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and<lb/> proceeded to the

                    whom we had been recommended,<lb/> having come eighteen miles. In the evening,<lb/>
                    <persName key="cjewi1">Charles Jewett</persName> and several others came to
                    see<lb/> us; they told us they had heard of the arrival of<lb/> some strangers,

                <p>This day we dined with <persName key="mpike1">Major Pike</persName>, in<lb/>
                    compliance with an invitation which he gave us<lb/> yesterday. He treated us
                    with great respect and<lb/> attention, and appeared to be pleased with our<lb/>
                    company. <placeName key="newje">New Jersey</placeName> being the place of
                    his<lb/> nativity, he has considerable knowledge of our<lb/> Society. In the
                    course of conversation he in-<lb/>quired after <persName key="pyarn1">Peter
                        Yarnall</persName>, and says that <persName key="pyarn1"
                    >Peter</persName><lb/> and himself were in the same military company<lb/> during
                    the Revolutionary war; he had not heard<lb/> of his death.</p>
                <p>The following circumstance, as related by him,<lb/> making at the time
                    considerable impression upon<lb/> me, I have thought proper to record it. He
                    told<lb/> us that several officers with <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName>
                    and himself<lb/> were lodging together; that one night <persName key="pyarn1"
                        >Peter</persName><lb/> alarmed them all with loud screams to such a
                    de-<lb/>gree that on first awaking he supposed the enemy<lb/> had fallen upon
                    their army with bayonets. <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName><lb/> was on
                    his feet, and appeared to be awake. They<lb/> spoke to him repeatedly, and
                    endeavored to ap-<lb/>proach him, but every advance they made in-<lb/>creased
                    his alarm. Finally he recovered himself<lb/> and became composed, and for
                    several days after-<lb/>wards, instead of satisfying their inquiries,
                    ap-<lb/>peared to be sunk in distress and gloom. He<lb/> afterwards told them he
                    considered his alarm as<lb/> a warning to him, and that his fright arose
                    from<lb/> a plain representation of the devil, come to take<lb/> him off.
                        <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName> in a short time left the army,<lb/>
                    and (said the <persName key="mpike1">Major</persName>) I always believed that

                <p>This day we dined with <persName key="fbate1">Frederick<lb/> Bates</persName>, at
                    his lodgings. He is descended from<lb/> Friends, and discovers great partiality
                    for our<lb/> company. He is a young man of superior under-<lb/>standing, and is
                    much esteemed in <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>. I<lb/> feel and
                    fear for the situation of this young<lb/> man. It is not in human nature to
                    support good<lb/> principles unblemished, when left alone to stem<lb/> the
                    torrent of fashionable and fascinating vices.<lb/><placeName key="detro"

                <p>This day we rode nine miles up the<lb/><geogName key="detror">river
                        Detroit</geogName> to take a view of <geogName key="lakst">Lake St.
                        Clair</geogName>.<lb/> This lake is thirty miles in length, and twenty<lb/>
                    miles in width. We had a beautiful prospect of<lb/> it, from a commanding
                    situation. I ought to<lb/> have mentioned that bordering the river, the<lb/>
                    whole distance from <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName> to the lake, the
                    land<lb/> is handsomely improved. The houses are so<lb/> near each other that
                    the margin of the river<lb/> looks like a village. These farms are grants<lb/>
                    made by the <orgName key="lowcan">French government</orgName> nearly a cen-<lb/>tury ago. They uniformly lie in
                    parallelograms<lb/> containing about one hundred acres. Added to<lb/> tolerable
                    dwelling houses are the handsomest<lb/>apple orchards I ever saw. The
                    extraordinary<lb/><pb n="108" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_108"/> healthfulness of the trees, indicates a
                    suitableness<lb/> of climate or soil, or both.</p>
                <p>The pear trees also are very large and hand-<lb/>some; but their cherry and peach
                    trees do not<lb/> thrive well, the climate being too cold for them.</p>
                <p>In this little excursion we were accompanied<lb/> by <persName key="fbate1"
                        >Frederick Bates</persName>, and returned in time to com-<lb/>ply with an

                    would be no marvel if we should<lb/> forget our homes, and think ourselves well
                    enough<lb/> entertained where we are; but whilst we have<lb/> been under an
                    apparent necessity of yielding to<lb/> the invitations we have received during
                    (shall I<lb/> say?) our imprisonment here, we know we have<lb/> been very
                    anxious for the time to arrive, in which<lb/> we may embark homewards, and hope
                    that to-<lb/>morrow morning the vessel for which we have<lb/> been waiting will

                        >Commodore Brevoort</persName>. About 9<lb/> o'clock sail was hoisted, and

                <p>About 4 o'clock this morning again<lb/> weighed anchor, and a calm coming on
                    about 10<lb/> o'clock, we anchored again near <placeName key="midbi">Middle

                    four to six pounds. The lake<lb/> water is so clear, that fish can be seen

                <p>About 10 o'clock last night, a light favor-<lb/>able breeze sprung up, which

                    the day under sail. At 8 o'clock in the<lb/> evening we dropped anchor, within
                    four miles of<lb/><geogName key="niagr">Niagara river</geogName>. Our commander

                <p>It is a pleasing reflection, that we are so near<lb/> to the end of our passage

                <p>At 4 o'clock this morning our anchor<lb/> was again hoisted, and in about half an

                    This is a small<lb/> fort on the Canadian shore of the lake, garrison-<lb/>ed by

                    ob-<lb/>tain a conveyance across the country to the near-<lb/>est line of public
                    stages. We were successful in<lb/> an application to one of the inhabitants,

                    us a view<lb/> both of the river, and of the adjacent improve-<lb/>ments. The
                    land is generally under cultivation,<lb/> and is tolerably improved. The soil

                    distant from the Falls. Considerable<lb/> emigrations are making from the United

                        >Canada</placeName>,<lb/> owing to the very advantageous terms upon<lb/>
                    which the British Government dispose of the<lb/> land, being scarcely removed
                    from a gift.</p>
                <p>We reached a Canadian town called <placeName key="chipp1">Chippewa</placeName>,
                    <lb/> to breakfast, after which we walked to the <geogName key="niagf"
                        >Falls</geogName>,<lb/><pb n="113" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_113"/> a distance of two miles. This was a
                    walk, of<lb/> which every step seemed to increase curiosity<lb/> and surprise.
                    Our attention was soon arrested<lb/> by a cloud which hangs perpetually over the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="niagf">Falls</geogName> for the height of 600 feet, arising from
                    the<lb/> dashing of the waters.</p>

                    and rocks shook, or seemed to shake, under our<lb/> feet, whilst the roar of the
                    waters so overpowered<lb/> every other sound that, notwithstanding we were<lb/>
                    tete-a-tete, it was necessary to raise the voice to<lb/> a very loud key in
                    order to be heard. Mean-<lb/>while the cloud above mentioned issued
                    contin-<lb/>ually in what we sometimes hear called a Scotch<lb/> mist.</p>
                <p>There is a common saying, <q>Those who know<lb/> no danger, fear none.</q> This
                    was our case on re-<lb/>turning to the extremity of an overjutting rock,<lb/>
                    called <geogFeat key="trock">Table Rock</geogFeat>, opposite to the great
                    cataract,<lb/> in order to gratify our curiosity, in a peep down<lb/> the
                    precipice which is more than 150 feet per-<lb/>pendicular. In passing afterwards
                    a short dis-<lb/>tance below this rock, we were alarmed with the<lb/> discovery,
                    that the place on which we had stood<lb/> was but a thin shell, the <geogName

                    we again found that<lb/> our second stand was almost as baseless. We<lb/>
                    however supposed that the danger was not equal<lb/> to our apprehensions, as the

                <p>The person who has engaged to take us<lb/> on our journey this morning has
                    disappointed us.<lb/> The circumstance is a trial, as we have become<lb/> very
                    anxious to reach our homes. Being at lei-<lb/>sure we accompanied the Indian
                    agent in a ride,<lb/> four miles above <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo
                        Creek</geogName>, to an Indian vil-<lb/>lage of the <orgName key="seneca"
                        >Senecas</orgName>, one of the tribes of the <orgName key="sxntns">Six<lb/>
                        Nations</orgName>.</p>
                <p>They are making considerable progress in<lb/> agriculture, live in tolerable log
                    houses, and have<lb/> a number of cattle, horses and hogs. We saw<lb/> many of
                    them at work; they were preparing the<lb/> ground for the plough by rolling
                    logs, taking up<lb/> stumps, &amp;c. </p>
                <p>We also saw among them a large plough at<lb/> work, drawn by three yoke of oxen,
                    and attended<lb/> by three Indians. They all appeared to be very<lb/> merry, and
                    to be pleased with our visit. The<lb/> land upon which these Indians are settled
                    is of<lb/> a superior quality. We saw amongst them <persName key="redja1"
                        >Red<lb/> Jacket</persName>, <persName key="farme1">Farmers
                        Brother</persName>, and several other dis-<lb/>tinguished Chiefs. Many of
                    these Indians wor-<lb/><pb n="115" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_115"/> in their ears, and round their necks,
                    strung upon<lb/> strings, several descriptions of Lake shells. Here<lb/> we met
                    with <persName key="sacca1">Saccarissa</persName>, a principal chief of the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora</orgName> tribe. He has come for the
                    purpose<lb/> of being assisted by the agent in vesting fifteen<lb/> thousand
                    dollars in the purchase of land from the<lb/><orgName key="hollco">Holland Land
                        Company</orgName>. They have greatly de-<lb/>clined hunting, and are
                    becoming agriculturists.<lb/> The <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora
                        Indians</orgName> removed from <placeName key="ncaro">North

                    then <orgName key="sxntns">Five Nations</orgName>, or Iroquois Indians, who
                    gave<lb/> them a small tract of country, which they now<lb/> think wants
                    enlarging. It is a fact, that the<lb/><orgName key="sxntns">Six
                        Nations</orgName> have stock in the Bank of the<lb/> United States to the
                    amount of more than one<lb/> hundred thousand dollars, from which they draw<lb/>
                    regular dividends. This is money which they<lb/> received some years ago from
                    our Government<lb/> for the sale of their lands.</p>
                <p>The Chiefs and principal people took the advice<lb/> of <persName key="gwash1"
                        >General Washington</persName>, in making bank stock of<lb/> their
                    money.</p>

                    a new town, handsomely situated. We have<lb/> had a muddy, disagreeable road,

                    were killed by some fishermen with their<lb/> spears, the warm weather having

                            forty different tribes of Indians. Of these,<lb/> the <orgName

                            and<lb/> their friends were in amity with the <orgName key="manah"
                                >Mannahoars</orgName><lb/> and their friends, and waged joint and
                            perpetual<lb/> war against the <orgName key="powh">Powhatans</orgName>.
                            We are told that<lb/> the <orgName key="powh">Powhatans</orgName>,
                                <orgName key="manah">Mannahoacs</orgName>, and <orgName key="monac"
                                >Monacans</orgName>,<lb/> spoke languages so radically different,
                            that in-<lb/>terpreters were necessary when they transacted<lb/>
                            business. Hence we may conjecture that this<lb/> was not the case
                            between all the tribes, and prob-<lb/>ably that each spoke the language
                            of the nation<lb/> to which it was attached, which is known to<lb/> have
                            been the case in many particular instances.<lb/> Very possibly there may
                            have been anciently<lb/> three different stocks, each of which
                            multiplying<lb/> in a long course of time, had separated into so<lb/>
                            many little societies. This practice results from<lb/><pb n="123" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_123"/> the
                            circumstance of their never having submitted<lb/> themselves to any
                            laws, any coercive power, or<lb/> any shadow of government. Their only
                                con-straints<lb/><del resp="undtermined">trasts</del> are their
                            manners, and that moral sense of<lb/> right and wrong which, like the
                            sense of tasting<lb/> and feeling in every man, makes a part of his<lb/>
                            nature. An offence against these is punished<lb/> by contempt, by
                            exclusion from society, or, where<lb/> the case is serious, as that of
                            murder, by the in-<lb/>dividuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as this
                            spe-<lb/>cies of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare<lb/> amongst
                            them, in so much that were it made a ques-<lb/>tion whether no law, as
                            among the native Ameri-<lb/>cans, or too much law, as among the
                            civilized Euro-<lb/>peans, submits men to the greatest evil; one
                            who<lb/> has seen both conditions of existence would pro-<lb/>nounce it
                            to be the last, and that the sheep are<lb/> happier of themselves, than
                            under the care of<lb/> wolves. It will be said that great societies
                            can-<lb/>not exist without the aid of government. The<lb/> savages
                            therefore break themselves into small<lb/> ones. The territories of the
                                <orgName key="powh">Powhatan</orgName> confede-<lb/>racy south of
                            the <geogName key="potor">Potomac</geogName>, comprehended about<lb/>
                            8000 square miles, 30 tribes, and 2400 hundred<lb/> warriors. <persName
                                key="jsmit6">Captain Smith</persName> tells us that within<lb/> 60
                            miles of <placeName key="jtown1">Jamestown</placeName> were 5000 people,
                            of<lb/> whom 1500 were warriors. From this we find<lb/> the proportion
                            of their warriors to their whole<lb/> inhabitants was as 3 to 10.<lb/>
                            The <orgName key="powh">Powhatan</orgName><lb/> confederacy then would
                            cosist of about 8,000<lb/> inhabitants, which was one for every
                            square<lb/><pb n="124" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_124"/> mile; being about the twentieth part of
                            our<lb/> present population in the same territory, and the<lb/> hundreth
                            of that of the British Islands. The<lb/> numbers of some of them are
                            stated as they<lb/> were in the year <date when="1669">1669</date>, when
                            an attempt was<lb/> made by the Assembly to enumerate them.<lb/>
                            Probably the enumeration is imperfect, and in<lb/> some measure
                            conjectural, and that a further<lb/> search into the records would
                            furnish many more<lb/> particulars. What would be the melancholy<lb/>
                            sequel of their hsitory, may, however, be<lb/> augured from the census
                            of <date when="1669">1669</date>, by which we<lb/> discover that the
                            tribes therein mentioned and<lb/> enumerated, were, in the space of 62
                            years re-<lb/>duced to about one-third of their former number.<lb/>
                            Spirituous liquors, the small pox, war, and an<lb/> abridgment of
                            territory, to a people who lived<lb/> principally on the spontaneous
                            productions of<lb/> nature, had committed great havoc among them.<lb/>
                            That the lands of this country (<placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName>,) were<lb/> taken from them by conquest, is
                            not so general<lb/> a truth as is supposed. We find in our
                            histo-<lb/>ries and records, repeated proofs of purchase<lb/> which
                            cover a considerable part of the lower<lb/> country, and many more would
                            doubtless be<lb/> found on further search. The upper country,<lb/> we
                            know, has been acquired altogether by pur-<lb/>chases made in the most
                            unexceptionable form,<lb/> westward of all these tribes, beyond the
                            moun-<lb/>tains, and extending to the great lakes on the<lb/>

                                >Man-<lb/>nahoacs</orgName>. These were probably the ancestors<lb/>
                            of the tribes known at present by the name<lb/> of the <orgName

                                Nation</orgName>. All the<lb/> nations of Indians in North America,
                            lived in<lb/> the hunter's state, and depended for subsistence<lb/> on
                            hunting, fishing, and the spontaneous fruits<lb/> of the earth, and a
                            kind of grain, which was<lb/> planted and gathered by the women, and is
                            now<lb/> known by the name of Indian corn. Long po-<lb/><pb n="126" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_126"/>tatoes, pumpkins, and squashes of various kinds<lb/> were also found
                            in use among them. They had<lb/> no flocks, herds, or tamed animals of

                            The several towns<lb/> or families that compose the tribes have a
                            chief<lb/> who presides over it, and the several tribes com-<lb/>posing
                            a nation have a chief who presides over<lb/> the whole nation. Those
                            chiefs are generally<lb/> men advanced in age, and distinguished for
                            their<lb/> prudence and abilities in council; the matters<lb/> which
                            merely regard a town or family, are settled<lb/> by the chief and
                            principal men of the town,<lb/> those which regard a tribe, such as the

                            deliberated and determined in a national<lb/> council, composed of the

                            number of<lb/> chiefs from the towns, who are his counsellors.<lb/> In
                            every town, there is a council house, where<lb/> the chiefs and men of
                            the town assemble when<lb/> occasion requires, and consult what is
                            proper to<lb/> be done. Every tribe has a fixed place for the<lb/> chief
                            of the towns to meet and consult on the<lb/><pb n="127" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_127"/> business of
                            the tribe. And in every nation,<lb/> there is what they call the central
                            council house,<lb/> or council fire, where the chiefs of the
                            several<lb/> tribes, with the principal warriors, convene to<lb/>
                            consult and determine on their national affairs.<lb/> When any matter is
                            proposed in the national<lb/> council, it is common for the chiefs of
                            the seve-<lb/>ral tribes to consult thereon apart with their<lb/>
                            counsellors, and when they have agreed, to deliver<lb/> the opinion of
                            the tribe at the national council.<lb/> And as their government seems to

                            States. To the north-<lb/>ward of these, there was another powerful

                            or approach<lb/><pb n="128" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_128"/> near to each other, as those who live upon

                            this war was long<lb/> and doubtful, they, in the course of it, not

                                >Mohawks</orgName> carried on a<lb/> furious war down the <geogName

                                >Mo-<lb/>hiccons</orgName> and river Indians, and compelled
                            them<lb/> to purchase a temporary and precarious peace,<lb/> by each
                            acknowledging them to be their supe-<lb/>riors, and paying an annual
                            tribute. </p>
                        <p>The <orgName key="delaware">Lenapi</orgName> being surrounded with
                            enemies<lb/> and hard pressed, and having lost many of their<lb/>
                            warriors, were compelled at last to sue for peace,<lb/> which was
                            granted them on the condition that<lb/> they should put themselves under

                        >Baltimore Yearly Meeting</orgName> for the<lb/> benefit of the Indians,
                    after the conclusion of<lb/> the Revolutionary was, was commenced about<lb/> one
                    year subsequent to the treaty of <placeName key="greenv">Grenville</placeName>;
                    <lb/> whereby a peace had been concluded between<lb/> the United States and the
                    hostile tribes, north-<lb/>west of the <geogName key="ohior">river
                        Ohio</geogName>. For many years those<lb/> Indians had proved themselves to
                    be the for-<lb/>midable enemies of the white emigrants who<lb/> settled near
                    them, and of the armies of the<lb/> United States, sent out to compel them to
                    sub-<lb/>mit to the occupation of a territory which they<lb/> continued to
                    regard as their own property. Hav-<lb/><pb n="133" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_133"/>ing been greatly improved in
                    warlike discipline,<lb/> and in the use of European firearms, by serving<lb/>
                    under the French commanders in former wars,<lb/> they adhered to any pacific
                    agreements no longer<lb/> than their fears or their interests restrained<lb/>
                    them; and rested in the determination never to<lb/> abandon their lands
                    northwest of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName>.<lb/> They had
                    defeated <persName key="jharm1">General Harmer</persName>, with the<lb/> loss of
                    the greater part of his army, on the banks<lb/> of the <geogName key="stjos">St.

                    routed. In this engagement the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/>
                        Turtle</persName>,* <note rend="asterisk">* Michikiniqua, was the Indian
                        name of this chief.</note> so often alluded to in the foregoing<lb/> pages,
                    was the commander-in-chief of the Indian<lb/> forces, and displayed feelings of
                    humanity to-<lb/>wards his retreating foes, of which few exam-<lb/>ples have
                    been furnished in the history of Indian<lb/> warfare, and which reflects honor
                    on his cha-<lb/>racter.</p>
                <p>On beholding the white soldiers fleeing before<lb/> the exasperated Indians, and
                    at every moment<lb/> cut down by the weight of their tomahawks, his<lb/> heart
                    revolted at the sight, and ascending an<lb/> eminence, he gave the <del
                        resp="undetermined">singular</del> signal cry, which com-<lb/>manded his men
                    to cease from further pursuit<lb/> and return to their camps; he also sent out
                    mes-<lb/>sengers to inform them, wherever scattered,<lb/> that <said

                        having killed enough.</said> By this effort on his<lb/> part many lives were
                    spared.</p>
                <p>After this defeat, so unlooked for by the<lb/> United States, <persName
                        key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName>, who had suc-<lb/>ceeded <persName
                        key="gstcl1">General St. Clair</persName>, arrived with his army<lb/> upon
                    the location where that officer had been<lb/> defeated, in the <date
                        when="1793-09">9th month, (Sept.) 1793</date>, and<lb/> immediately built
                        <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>. The next year<lb/> he brought
                    the Indians to a decisive engage-<lb/>ment in the vicinity, in which they were
                    over-<lb/>thrown with great slaughter. This humiliation<lb/> lessened their high
                    estimate of their own strength<lb/> and disposed them to peace, and a treaty
                    was<lb/> concluded between them and <persName key="gwayn1">General
                        Wayne</persName>,<lb/> who acted as a commissioner of the United<lb/>
                    States, at <placeName key="greenv">Grenville</placeName>, (<date when="1794"
                        >1794</date>), by which the tribes<lb/> northwest of the <geogName
                        key="ohior">river Ohio</geogName>, gave up the lands<lb/> so long the object
                    of contention, and accepting<lb/> a reservation in the neighborhood of the
                    Lakes,<lb/> came under the protection of the United States,<lb/> upon terms at
                    that time considered mutually<lb/> satisfactory and beneficial.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>, who appears to have had
                    a<lb/> just idea of the importance of the lands about<lb/> to be ceded to our
                    government, remained for a<lb/> long time inflexible, resolved upon
                    procuring<lb/> more favorable conditions. He was deeply at-<lb/>tached to the
                    country which had been his birth-<lb/>place, and in common with all his
                    brethren<lb/> considered it belonged to the Indians by right<lb/> of possession
                    from the Great Spirit, who, they<lb/><pb n="135" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_135"/> believed, after he had made
                    the earth, sun,<lb/> moon and stars, had placed the red man on this<lb/>
                    continent, and bestowed it upon him and his<lb/> children. He knew also, that
                    the whole region<lb/> around was made dear to them by every cher-<lb/>ished
                    remembrance; their recollections of the<lb/> happy abode of the red people
                    therein for many<lb/> generations before the coming of the white men<lb/> to
                    settle amongst them; as connected also with<lb/> the sports and pastimes of
                    their youth, and with<lb/> the enjoyments of their more manly pursuits in<lb/>
                    maturer years, and moreover as containing the<lb/> graves and other monuments of
                    their fathers.<lb/> These recollections were all quickened and in-<lb/>creased
                    in importance by the knowledge that, in<lb/> relinquishing the possession of
                    this fine territory,<lb/> they yielded up forests filled with herds of
                    deer,<lb/> and other game which, by the addition of the<lb/> fruits of their
                    grounds, rich and fertile almost<lb/> without precedent, gave them, even with
                    their<lb/> rude mode of tillage, an ample supply for their<lb/> simple wants. He
                    seemed also to be filled with<lb/> apprehension, lest when settled within the
                    con-<lb/>fined boundaries, which were to be theirs by the<lb/> conditions of the
                    treaty, that his countrymen<lb/> would be too slow in adopting the habits of
                    civil-<lb/>ized life; and as the supply of wild animals must<lb/> soon be
                    exhausted, would suffer many privations<lb/> in consequence of the change. As
                    such were<lb/> his feelings, can any thoughtful person be as-<lb/>tonished at
                    his resolutions?</p>
                <pb n="136" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_136"/>
                <p>Convinced at last, that no alternative awaited<lb/> him, he consented to sign the
                    compact, remark-<lb/>ing to the officers present, as he affixed his
                    sig-<lb/>nature, <said who="lturt1">I have been the last to consent to this<lb/>
                        agreement; I will be the last to break it.</said> He<lb/> remained true to

                            observations were made on the<lb/> kindness of their ancestors to the

                            exciting<lb/> a deep consideration and enquiry, whether under<lb/><pb n="137" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_137"/> the influence of that exalted benevolence and<lb/> good

                        friendly reception from <persName key="tarh1">Tarhie, (the

                <p>On conferring with them they found that a<lb/> mistake in translating their

                    every year at the full moon,<lb/> in the 6th month; they were, therefore,
                    too<lb/> early in their visit, and with the impossibility<lb/> of collecting the
                    other Indians who would not<lb/> be likely to assemble until the council,
                    they<lb/> concluded to hold a conference with <persName key="tarh1"

                    them on the sub-<lb/>ject of their visit. Their communication was<lb/> kindly
                    received, and an answer delivered on<lb/> four strings of wampum, expressive of
                    their<lb/> gratitude for the care and friendship of the<lb/> Quakers;* <note

                        be the<lb/> oldest Indian in the West. He had signed a treaty<lb/> between
                        the United States and the Indians as early<lb/> as <date when="1786"
                            >1786</date>, and although obliged by his warriors to take<lb/> part in
                        the revolt which soon after took place, and<lb/> in the battles subsequently
                        fought, he appears to<lb/> have been the first to persuade the Indians to
                        make<lb/> a virtue of neccesity, to <said>bury the hatchet,</said> and<lb/>
                        yield to the superior power of the white men. He<lb/> was cruelly executed

                    met, they would communicate to it the concern<lb/> the Friends now felt for

                    <body>
                        <p>While we were at <placeName key="sand">Sandusky</placeName> and in other
                            In-<lb/><pb n="156" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_156"/>dian villages, our minds were often deeply
                            af-<lb/>fected under the sorrowful consideration of the<lb/> baneful
                            effect of spirituous liquors on them, being<lb/> abundantly supplied
                            with it in almost every vil-<lb/>lage by Canadian traders residing among
                            them;<lb/> and we are confirmed in the opinion, that unless<lb/> the
                            traders can be restrained from furnishing<lb/> them with this
                            destructive article, in exchange<lb/> for their skins and furs, they
                            will not easily be<lb/> persuaded to turn their minds towards
                            agricul-<lb/>ture and the useful arts. At the same time, we<lb/> have no
                            doubt that these unprincipled men will<lb/> make use of the great
                            influence they have over<lb/> the Indians to keep them in their present
                            mode<lb/> of living, as most conducive to their own in-<lb/>terests.
                            Notwithstanding this cause of dis-<lb/>couragement, the great affection
                            which the In-<lb/>dians have always manifested for our Society,<lb/>
                            induces us to desire that Friends may endeavor<lb/> to keep under the
                            weight of the concern, and<lb/> be prepared to proceed in the benevolent
                            work<lb/> before them, whenever the way may open for<lb/> service among

                            the strings of<lb/> wampum moving, and spoke in a methodical<lb/> way,

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: I am desirous in the<lb/> early part of this
                            opportunity, that you may be<lb/> informed, that the people called
                            Quakers con-<lb/>sider all mankind as their brothers: that they<lb/>
                            believe the Great Spirit and Father of all man-<lb/>kind created all men
                            of one blood; and that it<lb/> is the will of Him who also created the
                            sun,<lb/> the moon, and the stars, and causes them to give<lb/> us
                            light,-the Great Spirit and common Father<lb/> of all mankind,-that we
                            should not do one another<lb/> hurt, but that we should do one another
                            all the<lb/> good we can; and it is on this ground, and this<lb/>
                            principle, that we believe it right to take you by<lb/> the hand.</p>
                    </body>
                </floatingText>
                <p>Then after a short time spent in silence, an-<lb/>other member of the Society of
                    Friends, <persName key="jmcki1">John<lb/> M'Kim</persName>, spoke, declaring
                        <said who="jmcki1">that the Quakers be-<lb/>lieved it required of them to
                        love all men,<lb/> without reference to location or complexion;<lb/> that
                        they were convinced it was not in their<lb/> power to perform their
                        religious duties to the<lb/> Great Creator of all things without his
                        assistance,<lb/> and therefore felt it their duty, when entering<lb/> upon
                        such important business as that in which<lb/> they were about to engage, to
                        sit down in<lb/> stillness and wait upon Him.</said> After some-<lb/>thing
                    more on this subject, and a reference to<lb/> the <orgName key="pym">Yearly

                        >Balti-<lb/>more</placeName></orgName>, he proceeded to say that <said
                            who="jmcki1">the Friends re-<lb/><pb n="162" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_162"/>membered the friendship which
                        had subsisted<lb/> between their Society and the Indians, from<lb/> their
                        first settlement in America; and recollect-<lb/>ing that the Western country
                        was fast filling up<lb/> with white people, and that game would
                        ne-<lb/>cessarily become scarce, they feared the Indians<lb/> would be
                        brought into a state of suffering.<lb/> That, in consequence of the long
                        wars that had<lb/> subsisted between them and some of the white<lb/> people,
                        the Friends for a long time had not had<lb/> an opportunity of taking them
                        by the hand.<lb/> That so soon as an opportunity had presented,<lb/> after a
                        peace was effected, a concern had arisen<lb/> in their council, and several
                        Friends were ap-<lb/>pointed to go out into the wilderness and have a<lb/>
                        talk with them.</said> He then called upon the<lb/> Friend who sat at his
                    right hand, <persName key="ethom1">Evan Thomas</persName>,<lb/> who had been one
                    of the mission to the Plains<lb/> of <placeName key="sand">Sandusky</placeName>,
                    to give an account of the move-<lb/>ment in this concern. <persName key="ethom1"
                        >Evan Thomas</persName> then gave<lb/> a very concise relation of the
                    journey, and the<lb/> conference with the <orgName key="wyandot"
                        >Wyandot</orgName> Chiefs, (which<lb/> has been before alluded to, and of
                    which a<lb/> narrative was published some years since by<lb/>
                    <persName key="pthom1">Philip E. Thomas</persName>,) and proceeded to inform
                    the<lb/> deputation that the Friends had received no re-<lb/>sponse to the
                    proposals then made to the In-<lb/>dians; but a belt of wampum and a speech
                    had<lb/> been sent them from a council held at <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit</placeName>,<lb/> and an invitation to attend their General

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We were glad when<lb/> we heard that some of our
                            Red brethren were<lb/> coming to this city, and felt our minds
                            drawn<lb/> to take them by the hand, and have an oppor-<lb/>tunity of
                            knowing them. As we have not been<lb/> made acquainted with their
                            circumstances, we<lb/> have not been able to judge whether any
                            thing<lb/> we have had to propose to do for them would be<lb/> accepted?
                            Whether they are really under the<lb/> necessity of applying to some
                            other mode of<lb/> living to obtain a livelihood, and whether game
                            in<lb/> their country is yet plenty? We have thought,<lb/> brothers,
                            that if it should not yet be the case,<lb/> that game is scarce, at the
                            present time, it will<lb/> probably be the case in some future time;
                            and,<lb/> therefore, we have thought it would be best for<lb/> our Red
                            brethren to give some attention to the<lb/> cultivation of the soil.
                            This is one of the subjects<lb/> which has claimed our attention; and as
                            we feel<lb/> in our hearts that we love the Indians and desire<lb/>
                            their welfare, we wish to turn their attention to the<lb/> subject; we
                            also believe, brothers, that we<lb/> derive a very great advantage from
                            reading<lb/> books which contain instruction, we wish that<lb/> our
                            brethren, the Indians, should partake of the<lb/> same means of
                            instruction with ourselves. We<lb/> wish you to let us know with candor,
                            whether<lb/> you desire these things, and if you do so, that<lb/> we may
                            do for you whatever may be in our<lb/> power.</p>

                <p>After a short pause, the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                    inquired<lb/> if the Friends had any thing more to say, and<lb/> being told that
                    we were all willing to listen to<lb/> him, he rose up and said:</p>
                <p><said who="lturt1">Brothers and Friends: My heart returns<lb/> thanks to the
                        Great Spirit above, that has put it<lb/> in our power to speak to each
                        other. My<lb/> brother chiefs and myself are glad that our<lb/> Friends and
                        brothers, the Quakers, have such<lb/> great compassion for their Red
                        brethren.</said> He<lb/> then spoke of the belief of the Indians, <said

                        and who were made when the earth, the<lb/> sun, moon, and stars were also
                        made, to be useful<lb/> to them and give them light.</said> After
                    referring<lb/> to the desire of the Friends to benefit the In-<lb/>dians, and
                    their need of that assistance, he<lb/> added: <said who="lturt1">You have been

                        been led astray by inferior spirits: we<lb/> now hope that we may come upon
                        your track,<lb/> and follow it.</said> He then said <said who="lturt1">the

                        Red brethren, since your fathers first<lb/> came amongst them, have caused
                        their numbers<lb/> to be greatly diminished. Those that have come<lb/> among
                        us, have very much cheated and imposed<lb/> upon us. They found us simple

                        <persName key="wwell1">William Wells</persName>, Indian agent at <placeName

                <p>After taking his seat, this chief appeared to<lb/> have reflected that he had not
                    answered fully<lb/> the questions proposed to them, and rising again,<lb/>
                    said:</p>

                        although the game<lb/> is not yet so scarce but that we can get enough<lb/>
                        to eat, we know it is becoming scarce, and that<lb/> we must begin to take
                        hold of such tools as we<lb/> see are in the hands of the white
                        people.</said> After-<lb/>wards he alluded in forcible language to the
                    con-<lb/>fidence which the Red men had in the Friends,<lb/> and that they knew
                    they desired no compensa-<lb/>tion for their services to them, and added, <said
                        who="lturt1">Bro-<lb/>thers, we are a jealously disposed
                        people-almost<lb/>every white man that comes among us endeavors<lb/> to
                        cheat us; this has occasioned jealousy among<lb/> us. But your talks,
                        brothers, are different, and<lb/> we believe you.</said></p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> then made a speech, in<lb/>
                    which he reiterated much that the <persName key="lturt1">Little

                        <p>Friends and Broth-<lb/>ers, the talks that you have now delivered to<lb/>

                        <p>Brothers and Friends, I observed to our<lb/> friends, the <orgName

                            now to you, that we wish our<lb/> brothers, the Quakers, to render us

                            hope you may not be prevented from ma-<lb/>king trial. If we had such

                        <p>From the great things, and astonishing<lb/> wonders, which we have seen
                            among you, and<lb/> finding they all come out of the earth, it
                            makes<lb/> me anxious to try if I cannot get some for my-<lb/>self.</p>

                <p>He then expressed his regret that the move-<lb/>ments of the Friends towards the

                <p>Here the interview with the Indians closed.</p>
                <p>After reflecting on the subject of their con-<lb/>ference with the Indian Chiefs,
                    the members of<lb/> the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian Committee</orgName>
                    regretted that they had<lb/> not made use of that opportunity to express<lb/>
                    their opinion on the subject of the use of spirit-<lb/>uous liquors. Another

                    away all<lb/> fear of giving them offence, he proceeded to ac-<lb/>knowledge
                    what he had witnessed in his visit to<lb/> the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot

                    of spirituous liquors was more in<lb/> the way of their improvement than
                    anything<lb/> else, and appealed to them thus: <said who="ethom1">Are you

                <p>After calling upon the chiefs to express them-<lb/>selves freely in regard to the

                        <p>Brothers and Friends, I am<lb/> happy to find it has pleased the Great

                        <p>Friends and brothers, I am glad to find that<lb/> it has pleased the

                            Your brothers, the In-<lb/>dians, believe that it is in this light the

                    introduction of spirituous liquors among<lb/> them, their numbers were greatly
                    diminished,<lb/> and taking advantage of the request which had<lb/> been made,

                        <p>I will now take the liberty to<lb/> mention, that most of the evils
                            existing among<lb/> the Red people, have been caught from the white<lb/>
                            people; not only that liquor which destroys us<lb/> daily, but many
                            diseases that our forefathers were<lb/> ignorant of, before they saw
                            you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends:-I am glad you have<lb/> seen this business as we
                            do, and rejoice to find<lb/> that you agree in opinion with us, and
                            express<lb/> an anxiety to be, if possible, of service to us,<lb/> to
                            remove this great evil out of our country; an<lb/> evil that has had so
                            much ruin in it,-that has<lb/> destroyed so many of our lives, that it
                            causes our<lb/> young men to say, <said>We had better be at war<lb/>
                                with the white people.</said> This liquor that they<lb/> introduce
                            into our country, is more to be feared<lb/> than the gun or the
                            tomahawk; there are more<lb/> of us dead since the treaty of <placeName
                                key="greenv">Grenville</placeName>, than<lb/> we lost by the years
                            of war before, and it is all<lb/> owing to the introduction of this
                            liquor among<lb/> us. This subject, brothers, composes a part of<lb/>
                            what we intend to make known to the Great<lb/> Council of our White
                            brethren. On our arrival<lb/> there, we shall endeavor to explain to our
                            Great<lb/><pb n="172" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_172"/> Father, the President, a great many evils
                            that<lb/> have arisen in our country, from the introduc-<lb/>tion of
                            this liquor by the white traders. </p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: In addition to what<lb/> I have observed of this
                            great evil in the<lb/> country of your red brethren, I will say
                            further,<lb/> that it has made us poor. It is this liquor that<lb/>
                            causes our young men to go without clothes, and<lb/> our women and
                            children to go without anything<lb/> to eat, and sorry I am to mention
                            now to you,<lb/> brothers, the evil is increasing every day, as the<lb/>
                            white settlers come nearer to us, and bring those<lb/> kettles they boil
                            that stuff in they call whiskey,<lb/> of which our young men are so
                            extremely fond.<lb/> Brothers, when our young men have been out<lb/>
                            hunting, and are returning home loaded with<lb/> skins and furs, on
                            their way, if it happened that<lb/> they come along where some of this
                            whiskey is<lb/> deposited, the White man who sells it, tells them<lb/>
                            to take a little drink; some of them will say<lb/> no, I do not want it;
                            they go on until they<lb/> come to another house, where they find more
                            of<lb/> the same kind of drink; it is there again offered,<lb/> they
                            refuse, and again the third time; but<lb/> finally the fourth or fifth
                            time, one accepts of it<lb/> and takes a drink, and getting one, he
                            wants<lb/> another, and then a third, and fourth, till his<lb/> senses
                            have left him. After this, reason comes<lb/> back to him; when he gets
                            up and finds where<lb/> he is, and asks for his peltry, the answer is,
                            you<lb/> have drunk them. Where is my gun? It is<lb/><pb n="173" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_173"/> gone.
                            Where is my blanket? It is gone.<lb/> Where is my shirt? You have sold
                            it for<lb/> whiskey! Now, brothers, figure to yourselves<lb/> what a
                            condition this man must be in;<lb/> he has a family at home, a wife and
                            children,<lb/> who stand in need of the profits of his hunting,<lb/>
                            what must their wants be, when he himself is<lb/> also without a shirt.

                <p>After expressing his<lb/> hope that the Great Spirit would aid the<lb/> Friends
                    in their efforts to assist the Indians, and<lb/> that they would use any
                    influence they possessed<lb/> with the great council of the United States
                    on<lb/> their behalf, and again alluding to the baneful<lb/> effects of
                    spirituous liquors, and the bad advice<lb/> of wicked men who wished to keep
                    them in ig-<lb/>norance, he finished by declaring that he desired<lb/> all that

                        difficulties you have stated, claim our sym-<lb/>pathy and solid
                        consideration, and we shall, I<lb/> trust, take the subject up, and if way
                        should<lb/> open for us to move forward, in aiding you in<lb/> your
                        application to the General Government, we<lb/> shall be willing, either on
                        this occasion, or any<lb/> other, to render you any service in our
                        power.</said><lb/> The conference then broke up, and the <orgName

                            a <orgName key="bymindian">Committee</orgName> was appointed by

                        <p>The truth of this assertion is abundantly<lb/> confirmed by a speech made

                            acknowledge our belief, that the<lb/> evil is of such magnitude, that

                            entertained. We are therefore<lb/> induced to solicit the attention of

                            subject; a subject which we consider involves,<lb/> not only their
                            future welfare, but even their very<lb/> existence as a people.</p>

                    the Tribes, to whom the United States under<lb/> certain conditions had
                    guaranteed their lands, in<lb/> the neighborhood of the Lakes.

                    increased their opportunities of useful-<lb/>ness; to these donations was
                    afterwards added<lb/> a bequest from a friend of <placeName key="irel"

                <p>Portions of these different sums of money were<lb/> faithfully applied, with
                    those collected from<lb/> their own members, in giving encouragement<lb/> to the

                            declined<lb/> both for himself and his wife. He was of a very<lb/>
                            warlike disposition, and the brother of <persName key="tecum1"

                            revolted<lb/> from their allegiance to the United States, and<lb/> were
                            the cause of much bloodshed on the Cana-<lb/>dian frontier. Already the
                            spirit of disaffection<lb/> had taken hold of his mind; he refused to
                            wear<lb/> any article of clothing manufactured by the<lb/><pb n="186" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_186"/>
                            white people, and was by no means reserved in<lb/> his expressions of
                            hatred toward the whole race,<lb/> who, he maintained, had violently
                            wrested from<lb/> them all their most valuable possessions. Nor<lb/> did
                            he hesitate to express his determination,<lb/> with aid of his two
                            powerful brothers, to regain<lb/> all the lands which had originally
                            belonged to<lb/> them, after putting to death all those who now<lb/>
                            occupied them.</p>
                        <p>In order to give him favorable impressions of<lb/> the power of the
                            Federal government, and re-<lb/>lieve his mind of the idea of taking up
                            arms<lb/> against it, the other members of the delega-<lb/>tion, all
                            friendly Indians except himself and<lb/> the <persName key="rave1"
                                >Raven</persName>, had persuaded him to make the<lb/> journey,
                            hoping he would discover, as he passed<lb/> along, so many evidences of
                            the strength of the<lb/> people he professed to despise, as to be
                            induced<lb/> to prefer peace to war, on any terms. No favor-<lb/>able
                            change, however, had been the result. He<lb/> had refused every civility
                            tendered him while in<lb/><placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>,
                            remaining shut up with his wife,<lb/> in his apartments, while all the
                            rest of his com-<lb/>panions partook of every enjoyment offered
                            them.<lb/> He had refused to meet the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian
                                Committee</orgName><lb/> in <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>, (but was afterwards induced to do<lb/> so,)
                            and remained in the same mood on his arri-<lb/>val at <placeName
                                key="ellic">Ellicott's Mills</placeName>; and although <persName
                                key="gelli1">George<lb/> Ellicott</persName> assured him he could
                            promise him a<lb/> welcome and kind treatment at his house, he<lb/>
                            still declined. The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                            endeavored to<lb/><pb n="187" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_187"/> change his purpose; rallied him on his
                            obsti-<lb/>nacy, ill-humor and laziness, and told him he<lb/> was too
                            large a man to give so poor a display of<lb/> Indian politeness, and
                            that he would return to<lb/> his home in the same state of ignorance in
                            which<lb/> he had left it; but all to no purpose. He bore<lb/> the
                            raillery with apparent good humor, but re-<lb/>mained unmoved. <persName
                                key="marp1">Marpau</persName> was of very large<lb/> stature, and in
                            the prime of manly vigor. His<lb/> dress was entirely made up of the
                            skins of wild<lb/> animals, which had been killed by his own<lb/>
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>Having heard so much of the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                Turtle</persName>,<lb/> I determined to be present when he and
                            the<lb/> other Chiefs were introduced at the house, where<lb/> they were
                            to be entertained as guests. He was<lb/> the first to enter the parlor,
                            and bowed grace-<lb/>fully as he was introduced to the family, and<lb/>
                            made a short address, in which he acknowledged<lb/> the pleasure it
                            afforded him thus to meet the<lb/> wife and children of a friend to whom
                            he felt<lb/> obliged, and of whom he entertained the highest<lb/>
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>The interpreter then introduced the rest of<lb/> the party, who shook
                            hands, and took their seats.<lb/> Afterwards a pleasant conversation
                            took place<lb/> between the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName> Chiefs,
                            the Interpreter, and<lb/> some of the residents of the village, in
                            which<lb/> the Indians drew a comparison between savage<lb/> and
                            civilized life, and in favor of civilization.<lb/> The <persName
                                key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> was anxious to have a
                            flour<lb/><pb n="188" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_188"/> mill erected in his town, and appeared
                            earnestly<lb/> desirous of promoting the improvement of his<lb/> people.
                            The <orgName key="shawnee">Shawanese</orgName>, the <persName
                                key="rave1">Raven</persName> and his<lb/> wife, and the <persName
                                key="beav1">Beaver</persName> and <persName key="crow1"
                                >Crow</persName> listened in<lb/> silence.</p>
                        <p>The dress and mantle of the <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName> bore
                            a<lb/> close resemblance to those worn by <persName key="marp1"
                                >Marpau</persName>,<lb/> and were of similar material. He was
                            esteemed<lb/> the greatest hunter of the <orgName key="potaw"
                                >Potowatomies</orgName>, and<lb/> occasionally visited the <geogName
                                key="rockm">Rocky Mountains</geogName> in<lb/> pursuit of game, and
                            on his last excursion to<lb/> that distant range, had killed a grizzly
                            bear of<lb/> immense weight and size, whose skin, dressed<lb/> with the
                            claws and teeth attached, he wore on<lb/> this occasion, thrown over his
                            shoulders. His<lb/> face was painted; the cheeks and forehead<lb/>
                            black, and across one of his cheeks was a heavy<lb/> dash of vermillion,
                            which looked like a deep and<lb/> gaping flesh wound. His hair, which
                            was thick<lb/> and coarse, was cut about six inches long in<lb/> front,
                            and hung about his face, but was its full<lb/> length behind, and tied
                            in several places with<lb/> bands of buckskin, and powdered with red
                            paint;<lb/> and he wore on the top of his head, a small<lb/> coronet of
                            eagle's feathers, Attached to an<lb/> embroidered belt hung his tobacco
                            pouch, made<lb/> of the entire skin of a beaver, and by its side<lb/>
                            his tomahawk and scalping knife. </p>
                        <p>With his large and muscular proportions, ac-<lb/>companied by the
                            disfigurements of the paint,<lb/> he was only saved from the appearance
                            of a bar-<lb/><pb n="189" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_189"/>barous and unrelenting savage, by a
                            countenance<lb/> expressive of the utmost good humor.</p>
                        <p>The wife of the <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName> was a young and
                            hand-<lb/>some woman, of a modest and downcast expres-<lb/>sion. She did
                            not seem to entertain the preju-<lb/>dices against civilized
                            manufactures, which ex-<lb/>isted in her husband's mind, and wore a
                            blue<lb/> cloth habit, though made in Indian style; a hat,<lb/> covered
                            with braided ribbon, feathers of different<lb/> sorts, and tinsel
                            ornaments. Her moccasins were<lb/> beautifully embroidered with moose
                            hair, inter-<lb/>spersed with plaited rows of porcupine's quills;<lb/>
                            her necklace was made of several rows of beads<lb/> of many colors, and
                            her ear ornaments, which<lb/> were drooping, and hung nearly down to
                            her<lb/> shoulders, were also of beads; and she wore,<lb/> wrapped
                            around her person, a fine Makinaw<lb/> blanket.</p>
                        <p>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> and <persName
                                key="rushe1">Rusheville</persName>, the <persName key="beav1"
                                >Beaver</persName><lb/> and <persName key="crow">Crow</persName>,
                            and the two <orgName key="shawnee">Shawanese</orgName>, were
                            dressed<lb/> in a costume usually worn by our own citizens<lb/> of the
                            time: coats of blue cloth, gilt buttons,<lb/> pantaloons of the same
                            color, and buff waistcoats;<lb/> but they all wore leggings, moccasins,
                            and large<lb/> gold rings in their ears. The <persName key="lturt1"
                                >Little Turtle</persName> ex-<lb/>ceeded all his brother Chiefs in
                            dignity of ap-<lb/>pearance-a dignity which resulted from the<lb/>
                            character of his mind. He was of medium<lb/> stature, with a complexion
                            of the palest copper<lb/> shade, and did not wear paint. His hair
                            was<lb/> a full suit, and without any admixture of grey,<lb/><pb n="190" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_190"/> although from what he said of his age, at <placeName key="fwayn"
                                >Fort<lb/> Wayne</placeName>, in <date when="1804">1804</date>,
                            being then fifty-three, he must<lb/> at this time have been fifty-seven
                            years old.<lb/> His dress was completed by a long, red, military<lb/>
                            sash around the waist, and his hat (a chapeau<lb/> bras) was ornamented
                            by a red feather. Imme-<lb/>diately on entering the house, he took off
                            his<lb/> hat, and carried it under his arm during the<lb/> rest of the
                            visit. His appearance and manners,<lb/> which were graceful and
                            agreeable, in an un-<lb/>common degree, were admired by all who
                            made<lb/> his acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>When seated at table they seemed to enjoy the<lb/> repast which was set
                            before them. A large<lb/> dish of hominy- a national dish with the
                            In-<lb/>dians- had with a variety of other dishes been<lb/> served up,
                            especially in reference to their tastes,<lb/> and was acceptable to
                            them. The <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName>,<lb/> on taking his
                            seat, immediately pointed it out to<lb/> his wife, who sat at his side,
                            and spoke for the<lb/> first time since his entrance, to request to
                            be<lb/> helped bountifully to the hominy, having seen<lb/> nothing he
                            liked so well since he had left the woods.</p>
                        <p>The visit ended very agreeably; the deputa-<lb/>tion shook hands with the

                            day on the hills, and in the fields on the banks<lb/> of the <geogName

                        <p>We were told that they spent a part of the<lb/> day seated upon the
                            rocks, contemplating the<lb/> scenery before them; they were afterwards
                            at-<lb/>tracted to a point where hickory nuts and per-<lb/>simmons were
                            abundant, and the Chief was seen<lb/> climbing the trees, and gathering
                            the persim-<lb/>mons and nuts, and throwing them down to his<lb/> wife,
                            who seemed fond of them. Thus, they had<lb/> passed the day, and looked
                            refreshed thereby.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName key="marp1">Marpau</persName> and the <persName

                            careful to present themselves, on<lb/> all occasions, where there was a
                            chance of their<lb/> being seen, painted and adorned in their most<lb/>
                            approved style. Thus, while in <placeName key="wash"

                                >Baltimore</placeName>, although in comparative retire-<lb/>ment, as
                            he did not go out, <persName key="marp1">Marpau</persName> was said
                            to<lb/> spend two or three hours daily, in the duties of<lb/> the
                            toilet, painting his face, dressing his hair,<lb/> and arranging his
                            appearance, by a small mirror,<lb/> held up before him by his wife, who
                            stood near him<lb/> for the purpose, pronouncing occasionally on
                            the<lb/> effect produced, and giving instructions. Similar<lb/>
                            attentions were conferred by the wife of the<lb/>
                            <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName> on her husband, but as he was of
                            lower<lb/> rank, and rather older than <persName key="marp1"
                                >Marpau</persName>, his toilet<lb/> was less elaborate, and occupied
                            less time.</p>
                        <p>The next day after this ramble, the <orgName key="potaw">Potawo-

                            before.<lb/><pb n="192" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_192"/> The other Indians, with the interpreter,
                            examined<lb/> all the objects of interest in the neighborhood.<lb/> They
                            had begun to be aware of the importance<lb/> of mechanical operations,
                            and spoke with as<lb/> much approbation as an Indian ever speaks of<lb/>
                            things which he admires, of the ingenuity ex-<lb/>hibited in the flour
                            and paper mills. The next<lb/> day all the deputation left for their

                        <p>About a week subsequent to their departure,<lb/> a member of the <orgName

                            interpreter, and was much surprised to find<lb/> among them the <orgName
                                key="delaware">Delaware</orgName> Chief, the <persName key="beav1"

                            >Beaver</persName>, according to the statement of the,<lb/> interpreter,
                            had left his party at <placeName key="cumb">Cumberland</placeName>,<lb/>
                            and had joined the present deputation in order<lb/> to present the

                            United States. For<lb/> several years their annuities, both as
                            regarding<lb/> goods and money, had been badly paid, and during<lb/> his
                            recent visit to <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>, <persName
                                key="wwell1">William Wells</persName><lb/> had uniformly objected to

                                key="beav1">Beaver</persName> thought<lb/> there was something wrong
                            somewhere, and was<lb/> determined to seek redness. The interpreter<lb/>
                            asked advice of the Friend who met him at the<lb/> hotel, and was
                            encouraged to make a faithful<lb/> statement of wrongs done to the

                    the Indians in a<lb/> battle fought the previous year, near the <geogName

                    made<lb/> by the government to procure peace. Partial<lb/> treaties were entered

                    and several military expeditions, which had been<lb/> sent into their country to
                    subdue them, met with<lb/> disasters, and by their failure only
                    strengthened<lb/> the Indians. In <date when="1793-04">April, 1793</date>, three
                    Commission-<lb/>ers, with ample powers, were sent to negotiate a<lb/> treaty,

                        >Greeneville</placeName>. In the instructions<lb/> given them it was stated,

                        approbation of the President<lb/> of the United States, decided to send some

                            influence to induce the hostile Indians to<lb/><pb n="195" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_195"/> a peace,</said>
                    but I do not find from the Journal of<lb/> the Commissioners that any Friends
                    attended.</p>
                <p>The negotiation failed. The Indians insisted<lb/> upon the removal of the white
                    settlements and<lb/> Forts from the country northwest of the <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>,<lb/> which the Commissioners refused to accede
                    to,<lb/> maintaining the claims of the United States to<lb/> certain portions of
                    the country under treaties<lb/> from other tribes who were believed
                    competent<lb/> to make title to it.</p>
                <p>By the treaty of <placeName key="greenv">Greeneville</placeName> the Indians
                    ce-<lb/>ded to the United States a tract of country com-<lb/>prising about
                    twenty five thousand square miles,<lb/> or sixteen million acres, some of which
                    however<lb/> was included in previous grants from other tribes.<lb/> They also
                    ceded sixteen smaller tracts as sites<lb/> for Forts, trading stations, &amp;c.
                    They received<lb/> in consideration of the cession, twenty thousand<lb/> dollars
                    in goods, and permanent annuities amount-<lb/>ing to eleven thousand dollars;
                    $9,500 in goods<lb/> delivered, the cost of delivery and distribution<lb/> being
                    $1,500. The annuities, at 5 percent re-<lb/>presents a capital of $220,000; thus
                    the entire<lb/> payment would be $240,000 for 16,000,000<lb/> acres of land, or
                    one cent and a half per acre.</p>
                <p>The annuities of several of the tribes com-<lb/>menced at once, and are still

                    of <placeName key="greenv">Greeneville</placeName>, received regular
                    annuities<lb/><pb n="196" facs="SW_GH1804_Page_196"/> from the Government, but I have not been
