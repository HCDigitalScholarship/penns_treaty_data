                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the authors' orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the pages of this scrapbook, even when the author’s
                    own spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain
                    about spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native
                    Americans who populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The
                    transcribers and editor attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized
                    spellings in all cases. </p>
                <p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                    <lb/><salute>Dear friends</salute></opener>
                <p>We write this to inform you that through a kind Providence we <lb/>are all well,
                    we hope we are united in love to our blessed Saviour. <lb/>We take this
                    oppertunity to thank you for all your good Counsel to us <lb/>and our People
                    both in your letters and when ever you have visited <lb/>us; all your good words
                    we have laid up in our minds: But par- <lb/>ticularly of late we have thought
                    much about what you have <lb/>advised us with respect to learning our Children
                    to spin and make <lb/>Cloth, which we think is the best <del/>measure we can
                    take <lb/>toward making some progress toward a Civilized life.</p>
                <p>We have therefore concluded to set about this Important work, <lb/>and have
                    agreed with <persName key="mdock1">Mary Peters</persName> (so called) who is
                    Married <lb/>but has agreed to undertake a spinning school next summer and
                    <lb/>make a trial what can be done now in order to effect this important
                    <lb/>good work: We wish for your assistance to procure <del/> wheels <lb/>Flax,
                    perhaps some wool or a few Sheep to begin with; and <lb/>also Flaxseed to be
                    given to those of our Men who will engage to <lb/>Culturate it according to the
                    manner of farmers; we wish you <lb/>to take these things into consideration that
                    we may see how we <lb/>can get along.</p>

                    off the use of ardent Spirits, or <lb/>not.</p>
                <p>We have left off a long time ago; you told us to <lb/>leave off, the Great Spirit
                    told us to leave off: we have <lb/>listened to His voice; there are some who
                    visit us from <lb/>the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> who drink; we
                    think they will leave off by <lb/>our good advice.</p>
                <p>Brothers <lb/>We are in want of Cattle, Chains, Ploughs, and all <lb/>kinds of
                    Farming-utensils; you have told us you would <lb/>help us; we were glad to hear

                <p>We had an interview with the <orgName key="onondaga">Onondagos</orgName> on the
                        <date when="1811-06-14">14 of 6th Mo, 1811</date>
                    <lb/>a Number present with their Cheifs they exprest a gladness <lb/> in the
                    oppertunity, appeared hearily to thank the Great Spirit <lb/>in preserving us on
                    our long Jurney and giving us this Opertunity </p>
                <p>We then informed them that we Joined with them in Ackno- <lb/>ledging the kind
                    care of the great Spirit in preserving us and <lb/>in giving us this Oppertunity
                    and that We for a long time had <lb/>them on our minds and that we believed that
                    the great spirit <lb/>warmed our hearts with Desires to do them Good, and that
                    we <lb/>had come for that intent, tho it is but a little that we could do.</p>
                <p>We then presented the letter--they then very Deliberately <lb/>took up and
                    Considered every sentence in the Letter and Oth- <lb/>erwise communicated and
                    exprest their approbation--they <lb/>then informed us of their situation their
                    former manner of living <lb/>said they, had got their eyes opened, saw it was
                    best to cultivate <lb/>the land and that they ware willing to work but wanted
                    Oxen <lb/>and Farming tools and some body to shew them how to mannage, <lb/>that
                    they had Confidence in their Brothers the Quakers. They <lb/>wanted their
                    Instruction and advice and above all they wishd <lb/>a strickt attention and
                    care to their Childrens education, they <lb/> wanted a school among them for
                    (say they) if we send them <lb/>abroad they Learn what is bad, Get their mind
                    alineated from <lb/>a love and desire to do the Nation Good, and feel above
                    them, and <lb/>so become Useless to the Nation and white people to, by mixing
                    <lb/>with the Baser sort of whit people, and so bring in that which <lb/>is bad
                    which their young people learn--for which they are <lb/>very sorry--but if they
                    had a school among them they could <lb/>often put them in mind to fear the Great
                    Spirit and so bring <lb/>them up to love their Parrents and Nation, and so the
                    would becom <lb/>useful and make good interpreters for them. The Next day
                        <lb/><date when="1811-06-15">15th</date> we met them at one of their feasts
                    of Worship near all the Na- <lb/>tion present they again thanked the Great
                    Spirit for preserving <lb/>us another night and gibing us another oppertunity,
                    we then <lb/>told them that we whare very glad to find them thus mindfull
                    <lb/>of the Great Spirit and that we desired to join with them in the <lb/><pb n="16" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_016"/>same,
                    and that we hoped that they would continue in their good <lb/>resolution and as
                    the Great Spirit sees and knows all that we did <lb/>that we hoped they would be
                    carefull not to do any thing which <lb/>they thought would be wrong in his
                    Sight, we also Informed <lb/>them how Glad it made our hearts to find them so
                    carefull of <lb/>their Children, we desired them to continue to teach them to
                    <lb/>work to love their Parents and obay them, and their Cheifts but <lb/>above
                    all to fear the Great Spirit who made them, and do not- <lb/>hing they thought
                    would be Displeasing to him--and desired <lb/>them to keep strong from
                    drink--they then seriously counseled <lb/>together and then gave us some account
                    of the form and manner <lb/>of their Government, Interdus'd us to their head men
                    the Cheifts <lb/>--and as we now Informed them that we ware about to leave
                    <lb/>them we desired them to take Good care of the Oxen and the tools <lb/>which
                    the Committy lent them, and thought we or some of <lb/>the Committy would make
                    them another Visit in the course <lb/>of this Season--they then thanked us for
                    the Oxen and tools <lb/>said they would take good care of them and endeavour no
                    damage <lb/>should befall them except the ware. One of the Cheifts <lb/>in a
                    very animated Speach eschorted the People--said the talk <lb/>of making us
                    another Visit, now how should we feel seeing we <lb/>have promised to do well if
                    when they come find some of us <lb/>drunk how shamed we should be to have them
                    know we lyed <lb/>and did bad to--this would be Bad enough, for we have promised
                    <lb/>them we would not Drink, Now Remember (says he) we promised <lb/>the Great
                    Spirit we would not drink nor do bad, now if we are <lb/>afraid that these our
                    good Friends should know that we do what <lb/>is not wright, how much more
                    should we be afraid to lye to <lb/>the Great Spirit and do any thing wrong, when
                    the Great Spi- <lb/>rit sees and knows all we do and say every Day and every
                    Nig- <lb/>ht. Now we have been thus particular for we considered <lb/>the
                    Indervew a very Interesting one and the Ideas the commun- <lb/>icated worth
                    preserving and what the Committy would be <lb/>willing to have. And now we
                    desire that truth <lb/>might be sought and waited for in seperating to go
                    among<lb/>them least they should be harmed, we may see they have <lb/>a high
                    opinion of Friends, they also are as quick to discover <lb/>and Notice any thing
                    wrong as any People we know of, I <lb/>believe we <del/>have felt our own
                    weakness and Insoficiency <lb/>and have been afraid least we should hurt the Oil
                    or the wine</p>
                <p>The parable of the seed sown in the field and the Lord answer to <lb/>the
                    servants was often revived in our minds, when the servants <lb/>sayed wilt thou
                    that we pluck up the tares. The Lord says not so <lb/>least ye pluck up the
                    wheat also. Now we feel easy to leave the <lb/>subject for further
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>We also took a little view at the <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>,
                    found <persName key="ahatf1">Absalom</persName>
                    <lb/>very unwell--we also say three of the Chiefts they desired to be
                    <lb/>remembered to the Committy their Good Brothers the Quakers <lb/>hoped they
                    would not forsake them tho some of them did conduct <lb/>bad, they said they had
                    bread corn so as to be comfortable </p>

                <p>Agreeable to the request of some <del/> of the committee <lb/>I shall endeavour

                    improvement; besides they have bought a tract <lb/>of land of the <orgName

                    and <lb/><placeName key="tonne">tontawonta</placeName> on their new purchase
                    those that Live <lb/>here have 18 yoke of working oxen besides those belonging

                    after makeing the above statement I think <lb/>may be proper to inform friends
                    how we have <lb/>proceded since being here and also to suggest to friends the
                    propriety <del/>
                    <lb/>of some things that apear to us to be absolutely necessary <lb/>in to
                    attain the object in view. We arrived here the fore part <lb/>of 10th mo. Last
                    the natives received us in a friendly manner <lb/>but yet with that shyness that
                    so universally conspicuous <lb/>in the indian character. Yet they furnished us
                    with the <lb/>best house they had which far from being confortable for <lb/>a
                    family to live in and for five on six weeks after our <lb/>arrival I could not
                    prevail upon them to do any thing <lb/>whether it was on account of a fear of
                    being deceived or on <lb/>account of its being in the time of one of their
                    annual feasts I <lb/>have not been able to learn although their eyes seemed
                    <lb/>to be continuously fixed on me in almost every thing that I <lb/>did there
                    fore during the time I mentioned I diligently set <lb/>about doing anything that
                    appeared to me to be necessary <lb/>to be done as though I had been on a farm of
                    my own and pretty <lb/>soon found they were pleased with it, and after the time
                    <lb/>abovementioned had elapsed what was left at home which was but few
                    <lb/>most of the young men being gone to their winters hunt <lb/>came forward
                    and went to work and we succeded in getting up <lb/>a comfortable shop and in
                    cutting and burning a sufficient <lb/>Quantity of coal for a years stock which
                    has enabled me to do <lb/>considerable smith work which was very much needed and
                    there is <lb/>still as much work as it will be posible for one fire to do and
                    <lb/>blow steadily I may here note that they selected three young men <lb/>to
                    Learn the trade one of which is to work with me who behaves <lb/>steadily and
                    well and has made quite a considerable progress in the <lb/>business for the
                    time. after bein here 2 or 3 months my mind <lb/>was arrested with the propriety
                    of a Schools being established <lb/>amongst them yet differing from the common
                    way in which <lb/>Schools are taught to be so calculated as in a very
                    considerable <lb/>degree to embrace the fernale part of the children as the
                    <lb/>education and cultivation of this looked to me to be a very <lb/>essential
                    object to attain</p>

                        <lb/>The Committee on the Concern relative to the Indian <lb/>Natives
                        report,</salute></opener>
                <p>That in attending to the Concern com- <lb/>mitted to their charge, the 4 tribes
                    under the care of the Yearly <lb/>Meeting have been visited by some of our
                    number; And <lb/>altho' some of the Natives are in rather an unsettled state,
                    and <lb/>looking toward removing their habitation, yet it appears by the
                    <lb/>report of our committee, that others are industrious, and <lb/>attentive to
                    aggricultural improvements; that in the <orgName key="brotherton">Brothertown
                        <lb/>tribe</orgName>, considerable advancements have been made therein, as
                    also <lb/>in the domestic manufactures, and an increase of attention to
                    <lb/>keeping sheep and other stock, inclosing their lands with better
                    <lb/>fence, erecting buildings &amp;c--which improvements have been
                    <lb/>promoted by small rewards for industry, having been paid out <lb/>of their
                    annuity. This tribe consists of 60 men and 75 <lb/>women besides children. Two
                    Schools are taught in this <lb/>tribe which appear to be under good regulation;
                    and one in <lb/>the <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> tribe;
                    where there is also a number of framed <lb/>houses and barns, and some farms
                    well fenced and under good <lb/>cultivation. In those families where the men are
                    sober <lb/>and industrious they are in the plentiful enjoyment of the
                    <lb/>comforts of civilized life; others less sober and industrious <lb/>are
                    consequently more needy. It was recommended to this <lb/>tribe to persevere in
                    manufacturing their own apparrel, as at <lb/><placeName key="broth"
                        >Brothertown</placeName>; which the sober and industrious amongst them
                    <lb/>are very desirous to do; and it appearing by a late Act of <lb/>the
                    Legislature that the disposal of their Annuity is confided <lb/>to the Agents
                    appointed by Government to receive &amp; pay the same <lb/>it is hoped that this
                    change in the appropriation of their funds <lb/><pb n="19b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_021"/>will enable each one to obtain
                    his equitable proportion, <lb/>and thereby encourage a system of industry, which
                    may not <lb/>only furnish decent apparrel, but attract their attention <lb/>so
                    as in some measure to draw them off from those wandering <lb/>habits which lead
                    to poverty and vice.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="oneida">Oneida tribe</orgName>, being the largest, consists of
                    <lb/>about 1150 individuals, some of whom have made <lb/>considerable
                    improvements in agriculture, and a few <lb/>who have inclosed large farms, and
                    improved them so as to <lb/>produce in great plenty: In this tribe is one school
                    taught <lb/>on the Lacasterian plan, and two Indian youths learning <lb/>the
                    Blacksmith's bussiness.</p>
                <p>The Committee have procured a friend, who with <lb/>his Wife reside with the
                    tribe at <placeName key="onond">Onondago</placeName>; One of the <lb/>Chiefs has
                    given up his house for their accommodation, <lb/>and he being a blacksmith and
                    his wife a weaver it is <lb/>hoped their services will be useful: The principal
                    men <lb/>appear disposed to promote the views of friends; and to dis- <lb/>swade
                    their young men from habits of intemperance; in which <lb/>they were encouraged,
                    and advised to wait on the Great Spirit, <lb/>to dwell in his fear, that he
                    might give them Wisdom and strength <lb/>to bring up their children aright, to
                    train them in habits <lb/>of industry, and the cultivation of their Land. They
                    having <lb/>concluded to promote the cultivation of flax, were also encou-
                    <lb/>raged to procure sheep, &amp; manufacture cloth: and it was
                    <lb/>satisfactory to observe that they appear disposed to acquire the
                    <lb/>knowledge of the most useful mechanic arts.</p>
                <p>The care of friends, and the continued in- <lb/>terest manifested from time to
                    time, was in the differrent <lb/>tribes gratefully acknowledged; and it appears
                    that <lb/>they still place such an implicit confidence in friends <lb/>that it
                    is believed there remains a service in the power <lb/>of the Society, still to
                    render this greatly injured people.</p>

                <p>The <orgName key="normis">Northern Missionary Society</orgName> have no pleasure
                    in being under <lb/>the necessity of communicating to you any improprieties on

                    patronage of <lb/>your Society, are employed as missionaries among the
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>The situation of the poor pagans has been to us for a long <lb/>time a subject of
                    deep commisseration, and we felt bound by the most impor- <lb/>tant
                    considerations to ameliorate their condition by every means within our
                    <lb/>power. The most direct means of accomplishing this was, in our opinion,
                    <lb/>the sending among them the precious Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
                    <lb/>affording school-instruction to their children; and this, at a great
                    expence, <lb/>we have for several years carried into effect, and are happy to
                    believe with <lb/>considerable success, as it respects many individual Indians.
                    A missiona- <lb/>ry is to this day supported among the <orgName key="oneida"
                        >Oniedas</orgName> under the direction of <lb/>this society.</p>
                <p>But we are not alone in feeling for the distresses of these benighted
                    <lb/>people--their situation has been felt and acknowledged by others and
                    amongst <lb/>these by the society of Friends; and we sincerely rejoice in every

                    industry, <lb/>sobriety, moral and religious princile. We cannont, therefore,
                    but regret that <lb/>any thing should have taken place of a character, to say
                    the least of it, so im- <lb/>prudent, and so contrary to christian meekness and
                    decorum. The opposition <lb/>made to the discharge of the duties of our
                    missionary was doubtless calculated <lb/>to weaken the influence of any
                    exertions which can be made either by your <lb/>society or our own, and of
                    course will be long remembered with great concern.</p>
                <p>The whole is submitted to the discretion of your society, praying <lb/>the Great
                    Head of the church to forgive whatever is amiss in the conduct of any <lb/>of
                    his professed desciples, and to hasten the blessed period, when he will mani-
                    <lb/>fest the glory of his Kingdom in the universal spread of his religion, and
                    the <lb/>enlightening of those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death.</p>

                        <p>Sometime in <date when="1809-06">June 1809</date> I was invited to preach
                            at the South <lb/>settlement by a number of Indians living in that
                            place. The third <lb/>or fourth sabbath in which I attended, I found it
                            my duty to baptize <lb/>the children of two Indians belonging to that
                            settlement and in <lb/>order to avoid giving offense if I could any wise
                            prevent it, I previously <lb/>called on two persons called Quakers, who,
                            I understood, had been living <lb/>for a few months in that place. They
                            entertained me very kindly in their <lb/>house, where we talked with
                            freedom about the objects of our missions, and <lb/>harmoniously agreed
                            that we should, as far as we could, assist each other <lb/>in promoting
                            the good of the Indians: that we should not cavil or <lb/>dispute with
                            each other in the presence of Indians about our different <lb/>opinions,
                            but conscientiously do our duty with all the harmony possible </p>
                        <p>I then mentioned the request of the Indians to me, and the duties <lb/>I
                            should likely have to perform among them; such as preaching, bap-
                            <lb/>tising, visiting &amp;c all which they seemed to agree with and
                            particular- <lb/>ly expressed their approbation of my preaching in that
                            settlement, <lb/>and it being sabbath morning, and the time in which I
                            had appointed <lb/>to preach there, the two Friends went along with me,
                            and, as I thought, <lb/>in order to assist me, blew the horn (as usual)
                            in order to collect the <lb/>Indians--but as soon as they were collected
                            the Quaker woman began <lb/>before them to find fault with my
                            principles, and to justify her own. <lb/>Hereby, I saw that she had
                            already forgotton our agreement, but I <lb/>thought it my duty to let
                            her see that I still remembered it, and <lb/>therefore immediately
                            walked with a number of Indians into the <lb/>house where we were to
                            hold meeting. The Indians immediate- <lb/>ly of their own accord began
                            to sing a Psalm, and I believe with <lb/><pb n="21a" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_024"/>the intention of putting a stop
                            to further conversation with the <lb/>Quaker, who had likewise followed
                            us into the meeting. A large <lb/>number of Indians were collected.
                            After the prayer I read Rom. 16 and 26 <lb/>verse. I had spoken to them
                            from the same text on the two preceeding <lb/>sabbaths; The first day on
                            the necessity of a revelation from God in <lb/>order to our knowing and
                            doing the will of God--the second day on the <lb/>manner of our
                            receiving that revelation and its certainty--and this <lb/>day on some
                            of the important things contained in this revelation which <lb/>it
                            concerned: all men to know and be acquainted with: nor do I <lb/>know in
                            the former or in this discourse of any expression which could give
                            offence to the Quakers; however, <lb/>after the discourse, I requested
                            the parents to present their children <lb/>to be baptized, and the
                            instant in which I did so, the woman started <lb/>up, like the man among
                            the tombs, crying <q>stop--the poor innocents <lb/>if baptized will be
                                ruined--they will be damned if baptized--it was <lb/>such ministers
                                as him who crucified Jesus Christ--he preaches for <lb/>hire--I have
                                thousands of dollors to give Indians, but if they <lb/>hear such
                                damnable doctrine--I will go and leave them</q> These
                            <lb/>expressions I distinctly recollect, but she continued using similar
                            <lb/>language all the time I was addressing the people on the natures of
                            <lb/>baptism, the parents of the children to be baptized--whilst I was
                            at <lb/>prayer, when baptising the children and during a prayer after
                            <lb/>baptism. She several times intreated some Indians who understood
                            <lb/>English to interpret for her, but none of them would do it. I
                            distinct- <lb/>ly heard some of the Indians order her to be gone, and
                            all seemed heartily <lb/>to disapprove of her conduct. After singing and
                            pronouncing the blessing <lb/>I said. Brothers, I have done as directed
                            by God's book, and what I am <lb/>bound to do, though People should rage
                            against me. This was all I <lb/> said. I immediately sett off for
                            meeting at the castle, having likewise <lb/>to preach at <placeName
                                key="squas">Squasalow</placeName> in the evening. I had no time to
                            lose. After <lb/>the above affair I was told that these Quakers bribed
                            the Chiefs to <lb/>order that none of that settlement should attend me
                            there, but <lb/>should go to hear me at the <placeName key="oneic"
                                >Castle</placeName>, and that the same men should <lb/>tell me this
                            who had invited me--several of them have since come <lb/>frequently to
                            the castle, but I understood that the Quakers with some other <lb/>white
                            people, have done all they could to persuade them from coming. <lb/>and
                            a certain character is engaged in this work, who, from his profession
                            <lb/>and the name he bears ought to think such a conduct an indeliable
                            <lb/>disgrace to him </p>

                    <lb/>cannot but sincerely regret, that any thing should <lb/>have taken place
                    calculated to produce a misun- <lb/>derstanding or have a tendency to weaken the
                    <lb/>influence of those who are engaged, either by <lb/>your society or our own,
                    in promoting the general <lb/>welfare of the poor natives. But when we
                    <lb/>consider the peculiarly responsible situation that <lb/>agents are placed
                    in, by residing amongst a peo- <lb/>ple <del/>not fully acquainted with the

                    of thankful- <lb/>ness, that they have not more frequently occured

                    <lb/><pb n="23b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_026"/>we reflect that nearly three years have elapsed since <lb/>the occurance;
                    &amp; that to prove facts recoursd must <lb/>be had to imperfect interpreters,
                    the difficulties atten- <lb/>ding <del/>an investigation at this time are

                <p>we have visited the Natives at <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName> and
                    <lb/>tho <persName key="mdock1">Mary Peters</persName> was not not at home, we
                    Conversed with Eleizabeth <lb/>and some others, and upon Consideration of the
                    subject it apeared <lb/>to me a Difficulty might arise from placing to much
                    property <lb/>in the hands of a few &amp; for them to Dispose of and divide
                    among the <lb/>others, all that kind of property (of small articles) which is
                    pleasing to <lb/>them being placed in their hands, to be devided as above: the
                    temptation <lb/>may be to strong for their week minds, and they reserving to
                    themselves <lb/>more then they give to others--this might produce enmity and
                    <lb/>Divitions among themselvs--it now springs in my mind, that a Dinner <lb/>of
                    hearbs with Contentment is better then Stalled oxen and Contention therwith
                    <lb/>the more I consider the subject the more important it apears to me <lb/>the
                    Concern of Friends I reverantly belieave to spring from that <lb/>love which
                    breaths peace and good will to all men. Some of us only <lb/>hearing of this it
                    may have prodused in us pitifull Desires and a <lb/>willingness to do them good
                    and while we endeavour to premote their <lb/>hapiness we may make them more
                    Miserable. I think I know by <lb/>experience that by viseting them in their
                    destitute situation (compareable <lb/>to white people) it has produced in me a
                    willingness to do that for them <lb/>which I have since seen would have ben to
                    their disadvantage at present &amp; to society <lb/>I find it requires the
                    wisdom of the Serpant to learn their dispositions <lb/>and know what they can
                    bare, and the harmlessness of the Dove to <lb/>make a right application. I feel
                    the need of more strength and wisdom <lb/>to direct me when I go among them
                    therefore I desire Friends may <lb/>not depend much upon me, great care is
                    Meidfull (it seems to me) Least <lb/>things are crouded upon them faster then
                    they can bare, and by doing <lb/>much for them they depend on it, and so not
                    help themselves <lb/><pb n="27b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_031"/>another thing which I have Considered a little has prodused
                    <lb/>some concern on my mind Respecting a Famely's living among <lb/>them, many
                    things present to view, which when Duely considered <lb/>will make the
                    undertaking apear a great one, serounded as these People <lb/>are with People of
                    Different Denominations who we may beleave <lb/>to be under as heavy a yoke
                    &amp; as Dark a Cloud as the Natives; these will <lb/>be watching and looking at
                    a famely placed in so public a situation <lb/>and will be viseted by Mishonrys
                    and others of information--some we <lb/>may beleave will inquire seriously,
                    others will seek an oration against <lb/>us--as these things have turned in my
                    mind great care has apeared <lb/>to be needfull--now as it Respects their
                    agricultureal improvements <lb/>I beleave upon examination it will apear that
                    those who have not had <lb/>a famely to enstruct them, have improved as fast as
                    those that have <lb/>had this advantage; not that I impute this to any Neglect
                    in those <lb/>who have lived among them--I only <del/> mention things as they
                    <lb/>apear to me. That the Commity may consider what steps would be best <lb/>to
                    take in <gap/>. I still beleave it would be a safe set if a select <lb/>Committy
                    to Cosist of not less then three ware to be apointed who would <lb/>be willing

                    <salute>Respected friend</salute></opener>
                <p>This will serve to inform thee that <lb/>agreably to thy instructions we call'd a
                    council yesterday &amp; there <lb/>ware many colected of the most understanding
                    women in this Town <lb/>together with some of the principal Chiefs of the
                    Nation: &amp; they <lb/>unanimously manifested their anxiety for having a
                    Spnning School <lb/>established in our said Town; There ware a number who have
                    Chril- <lb/>dren who ware so anxious that they promised to attend themselves
                    <lb/>in order that as soon as they become acquainted with the art they
                    <lb/>could then teach their Chrildren themselves; We have agreed that
                        <lb/><persName key="mdock">Mary Dockstoder</persName> (alias Peters) should
                    teach the said part of spinning <lb/>&amp; for none to have the privilege but
                    those who are intirely ignorant <lb/>of the same; It is not our expectation that
                    many at present will <lb/>attend on acount of the hurrying time of business but
                    a number from <lb/>seven to twelve <gap/> thirteen years will attend &amp;
                    others so soon as they get <lb/>through planting &amp;c; <persName key="eseth1"
                        >Elisabeth Seth</persName> has agreably to thy instructions <lb/>Destributed
                    the two bushels of flaxseed among ten famelies.</p>
                <p>We would further add in regard to said spining school that we have <lb/>agreed
                    upon twelve to attend said shool but there <lb/>are many more would be willing
                    to attend <lb/>provided they could be accommodatied for said <lb/>business. We
                    also were united in thinking that <lb/>we had very great reasons to be thankful
                    to that <lb/><del/>great and good Spirit for opening the<lb/>heart of our white
                    brethren and sisters to give <lb/>not only their good advice unto us from time
                    <lb/>to time; but likewise for the repeated favours <lb/>they have confered upon
                    us.</p>
                <closer>We would wish to be remembered to the Mem- <lb/>bers composing the Committee
                    and our sincere <lb/>and hearty thanks for their continued <del>thanks

                    beleave they require the simpathy of Friends--but when we <lb/>take into view
                    the concern of Friends for the instruction of the <lb/>poor Indians in Husbandry
                    &amp;c we become feelingly exercised <lb/>and it is no new thing with us we have
                    ben looking for others to become <lb/>under a simaler exercise and it is no

                    looking into the real situation <lb/>of things. We desire Friends would suffer
                    us to Communicate a fea- <lb/><gap/> while we humbly hope we are actuated by no
                    other motive <lb/>then in union with the concern of Friends for the Good of the
                    poor <lb/>Natives. The situation of <persName key="ahatf1">Absalom</persName> is
                    such that it appears to us <lb/>that they are unable to answer the expected
                    views of the Committy <lb/>all tho we feel tenderly for them and wish them so
                    treated as not to <lb/>hurt their tender tried minds, yet we have beleaved for
                    some time <lb/>past that seting asyde their ability, some other measure might
                    <lb/>be adapted which would be more advantage to the poor Natives, <lb/>now
                    seeing it is attended with so many difficulties and such <lb/>Great expence for
                    a Famely's living among them we have beleaved <lb/>that if these difficulties
                    could be removed and the money layd out <lb/>to a better advantage for these
                    Dear People the Committy would feel <lb/>it their Duty with us to adopt such a
                    plan. Now we have thought <lb/>that if <persName key="aruth1">Akers
                        Wrothbone</persName> (he living neerest) or some other person should
                    <lb/>spend all the time he could aford for one hundred dollars in teaching
                    <lb/>them in the art of Husbandry taking care of their tools &amp;c and at
                    suitable times to work with <lb/>them in the season of gitting in their seed of
                    different kinds this sum <lb/>would inable him to spend at least 3 days in a
                    Week through the <lb/>season which would be of Great use to these people this
                    would <lb/>answer in part the place of a Famely and remove some of the
                    <lb/>attendant Difficulties, and save to the Committy at least two- <lb/>hundred
                    dollars which sum might the be lay'd out to a good advantage <lb/>in precuring
                    implements of Husbandry and keeping them in repare <lb/>and in purchising wool
                    flax and seed of various kind, this would <lb/>be another great advantage to
                    thes poor People--besides they could <lb/>have the Farm <del/>Now ocupied by
                    Friends which would be <lb/>another advantage to them in precuring the Comforts
                    of life allso <lb/>they might have the <gap/> and tools now made use of by
                    Friends <lb/>to cultivate Sd. Farm, as it respects the spining school we would
                    <lb/>Recommend the same plan adobted as at <placeName key="newst"
                        >Newstockbridge</placeName>--there <lb/>are several <orgName key="oneida"
                        >Oneida</orgName> Women who are well acquainted with the art of <lb/>Spining
                    and neting who we have no doubt would be pleased to have so <lb/>much Notice
                    taken of them as to be imployed (for a small reward) in teaching <lb/>their
                    Nation the same art, they would have this advantage of explain- <lb/>ing things
                    to them in language they could understand; now it Seems <lb/>to us that if some
                    such plan as above should be adobted it would more <lb/>then supply the place of
                    a Famely--the views of the Committy better <lb/>answered by the poor people's
                    receiving a greater advantage--besids <lb/>save Friends from this evil report
                    which we have heard some say <lb/>the Friends are there to get their living out
                    of the poor Indians <lb/>This alls (in our oppinion) would be the most effectual
                    step to remove <lb/>the like suspitions of the Indians and gain their confidence
                    and <lb/>remove all those attendant difficulties of a Famelys living among them
                    <lb/>and save a Famely from that tried situation. All which we humbly
                    <lb/>submit for consideration. Desiring above all Dear Friends <lb/>that we
                    might all be ingaged for that Sperit which will unite <lb/>us together as in one
                    Sperit and one mind this would be a good <lb/>prepariation for teaching

                <p>By request of <persName key="jmott1">James Mott</persName>. I make the following
                    <lb/>statement being the reason &amp; cause of my <lb/>takeing a Lease of Land
                    belonging <persName key="iwobb1">Isaac</persName> &amp; <persName key="jwobb1"

                <p>Whin I agreed with the superintendant <lb/>of the affairs of the <orgName
                        key="brothertown">Brothertown Indians</orgName>. It was <lb/>agreed on by

                        >Henry McNire</persName> that <lb/>I should have the privoledg of the

                    addition to my former sallery which has not <lb/>been the case. I have only had

                    <lb/>although the superintendants has allowd me a <lb/>part of the rent of the

                    had nearly all my hay to <lb/>buy for 2 or 3 years--which was very expensive and
                    <lb/>inconvenint. But I should not have complained <lb/>of the imbarresments I
                    was under for I knew that <lb/>it was not all together in the control of the
                    Super <lb/>-intendants to furnish me with the land promised <lb/>for my

                        <persName key="tisaa1">Thomas Isaac</persName> petitioned the

                    as other citizen are subject to and there was <lb/>an act passed accordingly
                    absolving them from all <lb/>Laws and regulations enjoined on the <orgName

                    <lb/>and made them ameanable to the same Laws and <lb/>entitled to the same

                    soon became subject to many <lb/>Lawsuits and cost which brot him into

                    <lb/>of 180 Dollars per Anum &amp; got 2 years rent in <lb/>advance <persName

                    could not defend and in <lb/>the fall he told me he was determined to <lb/>sell
                    or dispose of his land or a part of it and <lb/>to leave <placeName key="broth"
                        >B. Town</placeName> I advised him to the conterary <lb/>but he percisted in
                    his determination and petitioned <lb/>the Legislature to authorise him to
                    alinate his <lb/>land. &amp; the bill passed the Assembly and he had reason
                    <lb/>to believe it would pass the senate: he requested me to <lb/>buy his Lot
                    near the school house as he was determined <lb/>to part with it I advised the
                    peacemakers to take it <lb/>and pay him out of the annuity but they declined
                    <lb/>and thot there was more that wanted to sell then to <lb/>buy--some of thim
                    advised me to buy it and take up <lb/><persName key="jcott1">J
                        Cotterals</persName> Lease as <persName key="jcott1">Cotteral</persName> had
                    put on two tenants <lb/>which ware complained of as intruders on Indian land
                    <lb/>and the attorney gave it as his opinion that they <lb/>could not be removed
                    off--and <persName key="iwobb1">Wobby</persName> said that <lb/>if I would not
                    take it he would sell it to some one <lb/>that would take it--or he would lease
                    it for a long <lb/>term of years so I agreed to buy it if the bill did <lb/>pass
                    &amp; to give him 1700 Dollars to be paid in <lb/>certain instalments--the bill
                    did not pass the <lb/>senate and I had paid <persName key="iwobb1"
                        >Wabby</persName> the first instalment <lb/>or took up executions &amp; paid
                    off judgements for him <lb/>to that amt. and took a Lease from him &amp; his
                    <lb/>wife for the Land and furnished him with a team <lb/>money &amp;c to moove
                    with. &amp; I expect to pay him the <lb/>balance when he git an act passed to
                    <gap/> him <lb/>to give a deed--or if he devises it to me his heirs <lb/>will
                    receive the amt. due--I believe there can be <lb/>but little doubt about the
                    vallidity of the Lease <lb/>or at least I have none, or I should not have
                    <lb/>taken it or paid any money. Though I did not take <lb/>it with a view of
                    speculation I considered that it <lb/>is as much money as it is worth in the
                    state of <lb/>repair it was in when I took it. I could have sold <lb/>my right
                    in it for the money I was to give for it <lb/><pb n="33d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_043"/>but I did not buy it to sell to

                        <lb/><date when="1815-01-02">1 mo 2. 1815</date></head>
                <salute>Brothers &amp; Sisters attend</salute>
                <p>We feel thankful to the great &amp; good Spirit <lb/>that he still puts it into
                    the hearts of a number of our white brethren <lb/>&amp; Sisters belonging to the
                    religious society of people called Quakers or friends, to <lb/>wish to have the
                    chain of friendship strengthened, which bound our <lb/>fathers &amp; yours
                    together: &amp; we feel thankful to you for the good advice <lb/>comprehended in
                    your address to us &amp; to our men. We heartily join <lb/><del/>with you in
                    believing that, it is not the will of the <lb/>great Spirit, that the children
                    of men should destroy &amp; kill <lb/>each other like the wild beasts of the
                    forest.</p>
                <p>Brothers &amp; Sisters, We are sensible that not only most of our men, <lb/>but
                    likewise many of our women, have that great enimy to con- <lb/>tend with called
                    ardent spirits the bane &amp; ruin of all Indians: <lb/>&amp; many bad meaning
                    white people being fully sensible of our <lb/>people's weakness therein, have
                    made use of that baneful <lb/>material in drawing our men into their intriagues.
                    They <lb/>have by that means got possession of a great part of our Township
                    <lb/>&amp; we are sensible that if they are not removed in a short time, <lb/>we
                    are a ruined people.</p>
                <p>Brothers &amp; Sisters, We are sensible that our lands are good &amp; that
                    <lb/>if our men will only follow your advice, with regard to culti- <lb/>vating
                    the same, &amp; to the raising of domestic animals, they <lb/>would do much
                    better than they can by hunting the bear <lb/>&amp; deer. And we heartily join
                    with you, in wishing that our <lb/>men would leave off the drinking of ardent
                    spirits: &amp; we will <lb/>use our utmost endeavors to persuade them to leave
                    off the <lb/>evil practice, &amp; to cultivate the ground &amp; raise grain
                    cattle <lb/>sheep &amp; flax, &amp; we on the other hand will endeavor as we
                    <lb/>have already began to learn to spin &amp; make cloth.</p>
                <p>Brothers &amp; Sisters, From the repeated admonitions we have received <lb/>from
                    those you have been pleased to send to visit us so great a distance,
                    <lb/>together, with other very great favors, manifests to us, that of all other
                    denom- <lb/>inations you who are called Quakers are our greatest friends. You
                    have <lb/>ever manifested your friendship not in words only, but in deeds
                    <lb/>likewise. You have been the means of addings greatly to the growth <lb/>of
                    civilization among us. Many of our people are daily experience- <lb/>ing the
                    good effects, of being taught the art of spinning, which has <lb/>been brought
                    about by your bestowing to us spinning wheels wool flax <lb/>&amp;c. together
                    with the assiduity of <persName key="mdock1">Mary Doxtader</persName> alias
                    Peters, who <lb/>was brought up under your care &amp; instruction, &amp; has
                    given us <lb/>great satisfaction with regard to her faithfulness in said
                    business.</p>

                <p><pb n="33h" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_045"/>Several of our youth have also been sent to different semenaries for instruction,
                    but <lb/>none have made so great proficiencies in the inglish language, as those
                    two, who <lb/>have been brought up under your tuition, namely <persName
                        key="jquin2">Jn. Quinney</persName> &amp; <persName key="shend1">Solomon
                        Hen- <lb/>drick</persName>, the latter being engaged in one of our schools
                    &amp; gives general satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Brothers &amp; Sisters, It would make our talk too lengthy to enumerate all the
                    favors we <lb/>have received from you, therefore must conclude by telling of
                    you, that your <lb/>red sisters are poor, &amp; all we can do is, to return you
                    our hearty &amp; sincere thanks, <lb/>&amp; to promise you, that we will
                    endeavor to follow your good counsels giv- <lb/>en to us repeatedly: &amp; we
                    hope &amp; pray that the great &amp; good Spirit will reward you <lb/>according
                    to your good works.</p>
                <closer>Brothers &amp; Sisters, With our best respectss &amp; unfeigned love, we bid
                    you farewell. <signed><list>

                <p>the inclosed letter which ought to have been laid before <lb/><gap/>committee at

                    <lb/>myself, may as well share the blame between us, I must own <lb/>I received
                    it seasonable to have forwarded it to the committee, it <lb/>having been
                    delivered to me when <persName key="jfros1">J. Frost</persName> went to view his
                    new <lb/>land, some time in the fall, no opportunity then presenting to
                    <lb/>forward it, it slipt my memory when there was one. Is is not <lb/>a matter
                    of sufficient importance to call together such of the <lb/>committee as are
                    convenient, and give <persName key="ewebs1">Webster</persName> an answer
                    <lb/>the few of us of the committee in this neighbourhood, are quite <lb/>in
                    favour of their being assisted in some way that they may <lb/>have a saw mill,
                    thinking it will be a means of furnishing <lb/>them with boards and timber in an
                    easy way, that may tend to <lb/>encourage them in providing themselves with
                    better houses and <lb/>barns,--and tho these are our sentiments we did not think
                    ourselves <lb/>warranted to grant their request, being of too much importance
                    <lb/>for our small number.</p>

                    exertion, they <lb/>use so much art and contrivance to get the chiefs in favour
                    of their <lb/>continuing. For altho they have been proceded against as the law
                    directs, yet <lb/><pb n="33j" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_046"/>by their influence with the chiefs, the matter has been so
                    represented <lb/>to the governor that he and the attorney general have directed
                    that <lb/>further proceedings against them be <del/>stoped for the present.
                    <lb/>and the probability is, that the chiefs will address the Legislature
                    <lb/>requesting a law to permit them to remain. nearly 100 families has
                    <lb/>already got in among this nation.</p>

                    <salute>To Friends in <placeName key="lond">London</placeName> Dear
                        Friends</salute></opener>
                <p>We have been appointed by the Com- <lb/>mittee of the <orgName key="nym">Y.M. of
                        New York</orgName> on <q>Indian Affairs</q> to com- <lb/>municate to you,
                    &amp;, as you may see fit, to other Friends <lb/><del>or to the Meeting for
                        Sufferings in London </del>some impres- <lb/>sions that have been
                    entertained by the Committee in re- <lb/>lation to the Indians in Upper
                        <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>.</p>
                <p>From information given to our Committee by <lb/>friends who have traveled
                        <del>considerably thru </del>in the upper <lb/>province, on religious
                        <del>appointments </del>services, as well as the <del>more <lb/> direct
                    </del> Statements containd in letters from that quarter <lb/>we are persuaded
                    that some of the tribes in that country <lb/>are very suitable objects for
                    benevolent exertion. One of <lb/>those tribes, (the <orgName key="massas"
                        >Messasagues</orgName>,) whose habits are migratory <lb/>&amp; unsettled,
                    are described as holding a very low rank <lb/>in the Scale of human
                    intelligence; and their sufferings <lb/>in the &amp; hardships are in
                    consequence extremely severe. There <lb/>is also a body of Indians settled
                    mostly on <placeName key="grand">Grand river</placeName>
                    <lb/>composd of the remains of the <orgName key="sxntns">Six nations</orgName>,
                    &amp; likewise an <lb/>establishment of <orgName key="mohawk">Mohawks</orgName>
                    in the vicinity of <placeName key="adolph">Adolphus</placeName>
                    <lb/>where friends reside. These tribes it is believed would be <lb/><pb n="39f" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_061"/>grateful
                    for any aid on the part of Friends to Ameliorate their <lb/>condition, and to
                    enable them to depend less upon their antient <lb/>habits of procuring
                    subsistance, which is becoming more and <lb/>more precarious. The accompanying
                    extracts of letters from <lb/><del>Peter Lossing </del>an intelligent Friend who
                    resides in Upper <placeName key="canad">Cana- <lb/>da</placeName> &amp; who has
                    been addresd on this subject, will furmish <lb/>more particular information
                    relative to the condition of <lb/>the tribes last mentiond.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to say how far Friends of <lb/>this, or of the neighbouring
                    Yearly Meetings, might be dis- <lb/>posd to instruct themselves in any attempt
                    to improve the <lb/>condition of the Indians in Upper <placeName key="canad"
                        >Canada</placeName>. It is obvious, <lb/>however, that it would be
                    necessary, as a previous step, to <lb/>conciliate the good will of the Canadian
                        <orgName key="canad">government</orgName>. So far <lb/>as fully to satisfy
                    its members that the motives of friends <lb/>were wholly disinterested, &amp;
                    entirely unconnected with na- <lb/>tional controversies &amp; national
                    prejudices. Hence it has <lb/>been our decided opinion, that, if any thing is
                    done, the <lb/>way had better be opened by Friends in <placeName key="lond"
                        >London</placeName>, in whatever <lb/>mode to them shall appear most
                    advisable.</p>
                <p>We are aware that there are very numerous &amp; urgent <lb/>calls upon the
                    Philanthropy of Friends almost every where. <lb/>And whether at such a time as
                    the present, it would be expedient <lb/>to undertake a measure of the kind now
                    suggested, we feel our- <lb/>selves incompetent to decide. But we are inclined
                    to believe <lb/>that with such assistance &amp; personal cooperation as the
                    Friends <lb/>who reside in upper <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName> might
                    be able to afford much good <lb/><del/>could be done at a moderate expence. We
                    hold it to be a <lb/>self evident truth that with respect to the adult Indians,
                    or at <lb/>least, with thou who are advanced in life, no radical change <lb/>can
                    be expected in habits that have been sanctiond by <gap/>
                    <lb/>custom, and interwoven with all the faculties of body &amp; mind. <lb/>Our
                    expectations of benefit, rest, therefore, with the youth. If <lb/>schools were
                    established among them, &amp; their children of both <lb/>sexes were instructed
                    in the english language* <note>*Schools upon the Lancastrian plan would probably
                        be more eligible.</note>, and, at the same <lb/>time, (as we think it would
                    be practicable) exercised in some of <lb/>the Mechanic Arts &amp; in the tillage
                    of the ground, a founda- <lb/>tion might be laid for a gradual &amp; important
                    change in <lb/>their ideas &amp; habits. It appears highly probable too, from
                    <lb/>the Statement of <persName key="ploss1">P Lossing</persName>, that the
                    residence among them, of <lb/>a judicious friend, <del>under </del>with the
                        <del>protection </del>approbation of the government, <lb/>might be very
                    useful, not only as a teacher &amp; adviser, but as an <lb/>instrument to
                    counteract the pernicious agency of the <del>profli<lb/>gate &amp;</del>
                    unprincipled whites to whom they are exposed.</p>
                <p>But the design of this letter is to present this Sub- <lb/>ject to your notice,
                    &amp; if you judge proper, to the views of <lb/>other friends in <placeName
                        key="lond">London</placeName>, without wishing to dictate <lb/>the measures
                    proper to be pursued. <del>If upon due <lb/>consideration it should appear to be
                        of sufficient weight <lb/>to engage the attention of the Society in your
                        land <lb/>there will always, we trust, be found a willingness <lb/>on the
                        part of Friends of America <gap/>to do whatever is reasonably in our their

                    <salute>Dear friends the Committee <lb/>for Indian affairs,</salute></opener>
                <p>I have had some conferences <lb/>with the Chiefs of the <orgName key="oneida"
                        >Oneida tribe</orgName>, those whom friends <lb/>have had the care of. They
                    acknowlege our kindness in giving them <lb/>seed, and furnishing them with teams
                    to do their plowing <lb/>this trying season; several of thier Nation have lost
                    their <lb/>oxen owing to the severe past winter, and are una- <lb/>ble to buy
                    more, and they request the use of two <lb/>yoke more; which I think will be of
                    great inco- <lb/>ragement as some of them are clearing and often <lb/>who have
                    not yet sowed any <del/>English grain see how <lb/>much better off those are
                    that have, wish to be enabled <lb/>to sow themselves. The cart of a yoke of oxen
                    with <lb/>thier apparatus will be at least $100 in the spring of the <lb/>year,
                    and about 15 less in the fall, being the cost of wintering <lb/>[The anual
                    expence of wintering oxen is generally <lb/>that sum $15]. Their increase of
                    Sheep has <lb/>been more than I expected some have a score of old <lb/>sheep and
                    a number of lambs and they have made <lb/>considerable woolen cloth the past
                    season. I <lb/>offered to pay for the Dressing of the first peace of <lb/>cloth
                    each family would make the bill of which <lb/>I have charged in my account. If
                    friends disapprove of <lb/>passing for dressing the first peace each family
                    makes of desire <lb/>them to note it in the next Letter</p>

                    <lb/>dated 12 Sept. 1817</head>

                    <salute>To the Society of Friends at the city of <placeName key="nycit">New
                            York</placeName>. <lb/>Brothers,</salute></opener>
                <p>We have thought it is our duty to address a few words unto <lb/>you in order to
                    brighten that friendship which your forefathers <lb/>and ours have always
                    maintained; and which we, their <lb/>children are still fondly cherishing under
                    the auspi- <lb/>ces of the Great and Good Spirit.</p>
                <p>We have this day received information, that our Western <lb/>Friends the <orgName
                        key="seneca">Seneca Nation</orgName> have recently agreed to adopt the
                    <lb/>good path, which leads to civilization &amp; which has been very <lb/>often
                    pointed out for them by friendly White People, but <lb/>particularly by friends,
                    who have always manifested <lb/>a tender regard for the welfare of Indians
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The main body of the <orgName key="seneca">Senecas</orgName> have for years
                    paste, repeat- <lb/>edly rejected the friendly offers, which you have made to
                    them <lb/>that is, that they should endeavour to follow the path of civili-
                    <lb/>zed life.</p>
                <p>However we have now rejoiced to hear that they will <lb/>now endeavour to follow
                    husbandry, and have now send <lb/>a messenger from one of their tribe to notify
                    you of their <lb/>determinations, &amp; to crave your advice &amp; assistence.
                    <lb/>Two other Indians we have understood will accompa- <lb/>ney him, one from
                    the <orgName key="onondaga">Onandaga tribe</orgName> &amp; the other from
                        <lb/><orgName key="oneida">Oneida</orgName>.</p>
                <p>We sincerely hope that they will persevere in their <lb/>determinations to follow
                    the good path, which will render <lb/>them happy and comfortable. We moreover
                    hope that <lb/>friends will render them their assistence in this lauda- <lb/>ble
                    work or beginning.</p>
                <p>We would further inform you that our people have <lb/>lately found the good
                    effects of husbandry, which they <lb/>have particularly practiced these many
                    years since.</p>
                <p>We believe there has never been so much english grain <lb/>raised by our people
                    as it has been this season. <lb/>The corn in general <gap/> very promising at
                    present <lb/>and have reason to <gap/>will turn out abundantly <lb/>if the
                    frosts do not <gap/> off again.</p>
                <p>We <lb/><pb n="43b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_069"/>feel happy to state that our young men improve greatly <lb/>in husbandry
                    and that they love to labor much within <lb/>one year since. Many are now
                    preparing to their fields <lb/>in order to sow wheat &amp; other winter
                    grain.</p>
                <p>We owe in a great degree these late changes to your <lb/>friendly advice which
                    you have repeatedly given us.</p>
                <p>We have reason to thank the great Spirit, that he has <lb/>pleased to put it in
                    the minds of Friends to visit us <lb/>often--and hope that they will continue
                    their visits.</p>

                    It would be very <lb/>desirable to assist these poor people, <del/>but it is
                    attended with <lb/>considerable <del/>difficulty on account of their remote
                    <lb/>situation, which makes it very inconvenient for us to visit them.
                    <lb/>Unless they are visited, and suitable advice afforded to them, <lb/>we
                    should allways be at a loss to know <del/>anything of their <lb/>general
                    conduct, or in what way assistance might be given <lb/>most beneficial and
                    usefull. From our knowledge <lb/>of Indians, we are satisfied it requires great
                    caution and care <lb/>in <del/>assisting them, otherways it may often injure
                    instead <lb/>of helping them--on this account we think it would be most
                    <lb/>prudent to do it rather sparingly, and then if they <del/>increase <lb/><pb n="45b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_072"/>in
                    sobriety and industry we may be encouraged to do <lb/>more. We should be very
                    glad if two or more Friends from <lb/>your place would be encouraged as soon as
                    convenient to pay them a friendly <lb/>visit, impart such advice as you may
                    judge suitable, and in- <lb/>quire into their general conduct, and how far there
                    is en- <lb/>couragement to hope that they will <del/>improve themselves <lb/>in
                    farming and civilization. If you should <gap/> with <lb/>sufficient
                    encouragement, you are at liberty to supply <lb/>them to the value of Fifty
                    dollars with any kind of farming utensils, or such other articles <lb/>as you

                <p>As I am desirious for the wellfair of <lb/>the Indians tribes and seeing their

                    to them as they <lb/>wanted it &amp; there was about a duzen Indians went down
                    with him when they sold <lb/>the land and they spent $700 in coming from
                        <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> to <placeName key="stock"
                        >Stockbrige</placeName> and <lb/>they that moved down took a bout $1500 with
                    them that by the superinten- <lb/>dants account from all their enquire &amp;

                    and whare they see the need of legistative <lb/>interference to apply for their

                    comply with your <lb/>request.</p>
                <p>I will begin by remarking that the title to all the <lb/>Lands in this State is
                    founded on the right of discovery or con- <lb/>quest and is derived from the
                        <orgName key="dutch">Dutch Government</orgName>, the <orgName key="brit"
                        >Crown of <lb/>Great Britain</orgName>, or (since the revolution) from the
                        <orgName key="nystate">State of New York</orgName>. <lb/>Titles not deduced
                    from one of these sources are deemed of no <lb/>validity in our Courts of
                    Justice: those derived from the Indians <lb/>are not in any manner recognized.
                    In fact, a grant of the <lb/>fee simple from the <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName> carries with it the exclusive <lb/>right of treating
                    with the Indians for the Lands which are the <lb/>subject of it; and without
                    such grant, no person can acquire <lb/>from them any legal right or title
                    whatever. This Doctrine has <lb/>prevailed in our Courts from the first
                    settlement of the Country <lb/>under the <orgName key="brit">British
                        Government</orgName> and has been recently confirmed <lb/>by the concurring
                    opinions of our most able Lawyers. All our <lb/>Northern &amp; Western Lands
                    held under Grants from the <orgName key="usag">Govern- <lb/>ment</orgName> have
                    accordingly been the subject of continual bargain <lb/>and sale from the
                    revolution to the present time without refe- <lb/>rence to the Indian
                    possessions. It is true that it was the policy <lb/>of <orgName key="brit">Great
                        Britain</orgName> before, as it has been of this country since, the
                    <lb/>Revolution, not to dispossess the native occupants by force, but <lb/>to
                    treat with them for the Land they occupy. It is evident however <lb/>that these
                    negotiations refer to the possession and not to the title; <lb/>for whether we
                    look to the transactions of the present or of former <lb/>days it must be
                    obvious that the prices paid to the Indians <lb/>are but nominal equivalents for
                    the lands they relinquish; the <lb/>real consideration being that paid for the
                    fee simple.</p>

                <p><pb n="47b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_077"/>With respect to the particular Tract of Country in which the <lb/>Reservations in
                    question are situate, the title as you may recollect <lb/>was disputed between
                    the <orgName key="masscw">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</orgName> and <lb/>the
                        <orgName key="nystate">State of New York</orgName>, each claiming under
                    Grants or Charters from <lb/>the <orgName key="brit">Crown of England</orgName>.
                    In the year <date when="1786">1786</date> a Convention was held for <lb/>a
                    settlement of these differeces, which resulted in a cession by <lb/><orgName
                        key="nystate">New York</orgName> to <orgName key="masscw"
                        >Massachusetts</orgName> of the right of Soil and all other <lb/>right,
                    except that of Sovereignty and Jurisdiction, in the whole <lb/>Tract now called
                    the <placeName key="genec">Genesee Country</placeName>, the right of holding
                    <lb/>Treaties with the native Indians for the extinguishment of <lb/>their
                    claims and of granting that right to Purchasers under <lb/>them, being expressly
                    reserved to <orgName key="masscw">Massachusetts</orgName>.</p>
                <p>Under this Convention and before any negotiation with <lb/>the Indians, <orgName
                        key="masscw">Massachusetts</orgName> sold the fee simple of all the
                    <lb/>Lands in this Tract of Country, part to Gorham and Phelps <lb/>and part,
                    including these Reservations, to <persName key="rmorr1">Robert
                    Morris</persName>, <lb/>who again sold to the <orgName key="hollco">Holland
                        Company</orgName> and others. In <lb/>the year <date when="1797">1797</date>
                    and subsequent to this last sale, the Indians <lb/>released to the different
                    proprietors the great bulk of <lb/>Morris's purchase. The present Reservations
                    are not in- <lb/>cluded in that release, but remain, as to the Indian claim,
                    <lb/>in the same situation as they were, when sold by the <orgName key="masscw"
                        >State <lb/>of Massachusetts</orgName>; and as such, were sold, after the
                    Treaty of <lb/>1797, by the <orgName key="hollco">Holland Company</orgName> to
                        <persName key="dogde1">David A. Ogden</persName>, who has <lb/>since sold,
                    in like manner, to various purchasers under him.</p>
                <p>It results from what has been said that the Indians have <lb/>a mere right of
                    possession in these Reservations, which they <lb/>are incapable of conveying,
                    except to the proprietor of the fee: <lb/>and that, without his consent, no
                    arrangement can be <lb/>accomplished, by which to change or modify their present
                    <lb/>tenure.</p>
                <p>In making these remarks, I do not wish to be <lb/>understood as intimating a
                    disinclination on the part <lb/>of the proprietors, to concur in any reasonable
                    plan calcu- <lb/>lated to ameliorate the condition of the Indians:on the
                    contrary <lb/>I am persuaded that such a plan would receive their ready
                    <lb/>co-operation. For, whatever prejudices may be entertained <lb/>on this
                    subject, I can conidently assure you, that they <lb/>are disposed not to oppress
                    or injure this unfortunate <lb/>race of People, but to act towards them with
                    Equity and <lb/>Kindness. At the same time, I do not hesitate to declare <lb/>my
                    entire conviction, that no material progress can be <lb/>made in the great and
                    benevolent purpose of changing <lb/>their habits and pursuits, until they shall
                    be removed <lb/>to a greater distance from Settlements. Experience has
                    <lb/>shewn conclusively, that wherever Indians have easy <lb/>opportunities of
                    Intercourse with White People, their Men <lb/>become Drunkards, and their Women
                    Prostituted; that <lb/>all the virtues belonging to savage life are extinguished
                    <lb/>and the low vices of our worst states of Society adopted. <lb/>The
                    condition of the Indians in the neighbourhood of <lb/><placeName key="buffa"
                        >Buffalo</placeName> affords a strikin illustration of this Truth.
                    <lb/>Their depravity is offensive to common decency, and those <lb/>especially
                    among the Females who profess to become Con- <lb/>verts to the Christian Faith,
                    are said to be the most aban- <lb/>doned and shameless in their intercourse with
                    the White Men.</p>
                <p>Under the circumstances in which they are now <lb/>placed, it seems to me, that
                    the true Interests of the Indians <lb/>will be best promoted, either by removing
                    them to a remote <lb/>situation, prossessing the requisite advantages of soil
                    and <lb/>climate, where they shall be protected by the Government <lb/>and
                    secured from the near approach of White Settlement <lb/>or by concentrating them
                    on one of the reservations they <lb/>now occupy. In the latter situation they
                    would be under the <lb/>more immediate care and inspectionof those who may be
                    <lb/>disposed to take the charge of their instruction; but whether <lb/>this
                    advantage would not be counterbalanced by the <lb/>continual approaches of
                    Settlers, deserves consideration. <lb/><pb n="47d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_078"/>If not, the reserved Lands on the
                        <placeName key="alleg1">Allegany</placeName>, amounting to <lb/>upwards of
                    20,000 Acres appear to me best calculated for <lb/>their residence. These Lands
                    are very fertile, they skirt <del/>
                    <lb/>both banks of the river for a great distance, and lie at the <lb/>foot of
                    high and rough mountains, which are little calcu- <lb/>lated to invite
                    settlements. There the Indians would be <lb/>in a manner insulated; and their
                    annuities (increased <lb/>by the sale of the other Tracts) would furnish means
                    to <lb/>provide Clothing, Farming Implements, and other com- <lb/>forts
                    connected with civilized life. As the <orgName key="usag">General
                        Gov<lb/>ernment</orgName> have offered the Indians a Tract of Country
                    <lb/>to the South West, understood to be very favourably situ- <lb/>ated, and a
                    great part of the Nation seems bent on remo- <lb/>val, it would perhaps be most
                    advisable, even if they <lb/>should accept that offer, that one of the
                    reservations be <lb/>retained for the accomodation of those who may be averse
                    <lb/>to that measure, and such as incline to remain, may be <lb/>allowed to
                    contiunue on the Lands they cultivate till they find <lb/>it convenient to leave
                    them. The comparative advantages <lb/>of the old and new Establishments will be
                    ascertained in the <lb/>course of a few years, and the fostering care of the
                    benevolent <lb/>can then be bestowed on that which may be found most
                    eligible.</p>
                <p>In the general view which you and other friends of <lb/>these Indians may take of
                    their condition and prospects <lb/>it would be improvided to overlook those
                    considerations <lb/>of Public Policy and convenience which are inseparably
                    <lb/>connected with the subject. The sentiments contained <lb/>in <persName
                        key="jmonr1">President Monroe</persName>'s Message, as well as those
                    undertood <lb/>to be entertained by our State Government seem to forbid
                    <lb/>equally the long continuance of a state of things by which <lb/>an
                    extensive Wilderness is to be preserved in the heart of <lb/>Population and
                    Improvement, and a property which to <lb/>add to the public resources and
                    prosperity is made to <lb/>interfere with both. Individual feelings and
                    interests <lb/><pb n="47e" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_079"/>are in unison with the public policy on this question, and
                    <lb/>so plain and palpable is the necessity of the speedy removal <lb/>of the
                    Indians from the <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="tonne">Tonnewanta</placeName> Reservations <lb/>that there would be no
                    difficulty in now selling them in detail <lb/>and at extravagant prices. In fact
                    a large and powerful <lb/>Company has offered to purchase the legal title to one
                    of <lb/>them, with a view to take possession of the Lands not actually
                    <lb/>cultivated by the Indians, and to hold in defiance of their <lb/>claim; but
                    it was not thought right by my Brother, to <lb/>expose the Indians to the
                    collisions and encroachments, <lb/>which such a Sale would necessarily subject
                    them to, <lb/>and the offer was therefore declined.</p>

                <head>Letter from <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> Committee,
                    <lb/>with copy of a Letter from <persName key="jmonr1">James Munroe</persName>
                    to the Indians <lb/>1819</head>
                <opener><salute>Dear Friends</salute></opener>
                <p>Your letter of the 8th instant, was received this morning, <lb/>and in reply to
                    which we will observe, That at the present very interesting <lb/>Crisis of
                    Indian Affairs, and particularly as relating to those Indians, who <lb/>yet
                    retain reservations of land within the <placeName key="mass"
                        >Massachusetts</placeName> claim, we apprehend <lb/>every step contemplated
                    by their friends, ought to be maturely considered and <lb/>examined, before
                    acting on, least what may appear of advantage to these poor <lb/>and much
                    oppress'd part ot the human family, should in its ultimate result <lb/>prove to
                    be quite the contrary. For instance, those Indians are now under <lb/>the care
                    &amp; protection of the <orgName key="usag">United States</orgName>, as will be
                    seen in the Treaty, contained <lb/>in the pamphlet forwarded to <persName
                        key="rmott1">Rich. Mott</persName> last week, should they be prematurely
                    <lb/>placed under the intire direction &amp; management of the State
                    Legislature, is <lb/>there not danger to be apprehended that the influence of
                    the Speculators <lb/>in the last remnant of their land, would be more likely to
                    obtain their <lb/>object, than if the Indians remained as they are at present
                    situated? <lb/>Again--Would not a division of the land of these Indians be more
                    <lb/>likely to produce among them the obvious necessity of having a few laws
                    <lb/>instituted for their regulation, and thus induce them to apply to the
                    <lb/>competent authority, for such as should appear indispensable, and which
                    <lb/>would of course be more congenial to their feelings and sense of propriety,
                    than <lb/>if they should be presented with a code of regulations, and informed
                    that they <lb/>must conform to the requisitions therein contained, without
                    feeling the <lb/>necessity of such compliance?</p>
                <p>Has not experience proved the danger there exists in oppointing <lb/>agents &amp;
                    Commissioners by law, to the care of Indian lands? see the <lb/>sentiments of
                    the Indians on this subject 3rd paragraph 17th page in the <lb/>pamphlet already
                    noted--and if we are correctly informed, the transactions <lb/>now in operation
                    with either the <orgName key="brotherton">Brothertown</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> or <orgName key="oneida"
                        >Oneida</orgName>
                    <lb/>Indians and one of their care takers, is not void of admonition on <lb/>on
                    this delicate subject.</p>
                <p>There is, and it is gratefull to us in observing it, a general <lb/>sensation
                    felt, on behalf of the Aborigines of our Country--but this may <lb/>subside--we
                    wish to make use of the favourable opportunity, to effect <lb/>some permanent
                    advantage to the natives, without requiring from <lb/><orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName> anything but what Justice demands. It does not appear
                    <lb/>to us that those Indians who are the immediate subjects of this Communi-
                    <lb/>cation, require much, if any pecuniary aid at this time from <orgName
                        key="usag">Government</orgName>
                    <lb/><pb n="51b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_087b"/>provided the annuities paid to them were applied as they ought to be.</p>
                <p>Our Society have engaged in this important Concern, under <lb/>an apprehendsion
                    of Religious duty, and in the prosection of which, <lb/>they have been careful
                    not to mix with the policy or the funds of the <lb/><orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName>--and we have been well satisfied, many times, that
                    this <lb/>and this only, was safe ground for us to move on, and are induced to
                    believe <lb/>that it remains, and will remain, so to be.</p>
                <p>Under these views, we feel easy to rest the subject, as it relates <lb/>to the
                    Indians on the <placeName key="holland">Holland Purchase</placeName>, for the
                    present, and suggest the <lb/>propriety of a full and free Conference being at a
                    suitable time had <lb/>with your and our Committees, in which a plan may be
                    digested matured <lb/>&amp; adopted, calculated to effect the results so
                    desirable to us all.</p>
                <p>You have kindly invited us to a free communication of our <lb/>sentiments, and we
                    have accordingly, used much freedom &amp; candor in <lb/>the foregoing, in order
                    that we may have a clear &amp; distinct understanding <lb/>of each others
                    sentiments--believing that it will require not only the <lb/>unity of sentiment,
                    but the Cooperation of exertion in the friends of <lb/>the Indians, to secure to
                    them, the small, the very small, pittance <lb/>of the great abundance of land
                    which they or their Ancestors <lb/>once possess'd.</p>

                        <opener>My Red Children,</opener>
                        <p>I am glad to learn by your friends <lb/><persName key="sbett1">Samuel

                                key="jcook1">John Cook</persName>, that you <lb/>no longer live in
                            that miserable and destitute state which you once <lb/>did. They say
                            that most of you have become sober, and industrious; <lb/>that you have
                            got good houses to live in, and that by cultivating the <lb/>ground and
                            raising cattle, you have now a plenty to eat. This is to <lb/>me very
                            good news--as I shall always rejoice to hear of the <lb/>happiness of my
                            red Children</p>
                        <p>My Red Children <lb/>You cannot become civilized 'till you have
                            <lb/>advanced one step further, you know that among my white children
                            <lb/>each one has his own land separate from all others. You ought to do
                            <lb/>the same; you ought to divide your land among families, in
                            <lb/>lots sufficiently large to maintain a Family according to its size.
                            <lb/>Your good friends the Quakers, would, no doubt, enable you <lb/>to
                            make a just and equitable division. By this dividing your <lb/>land,
                            each one could then say, this is mine; and he would <lb/>have
                            inducements to put up good houses on it, and improve <lb/>his land by
                            Cultivation.</p>

                <p>In compliance with the request of <persName key="redja1">Red Jackit</persName>
                    <lb/>one of the chiefs of the <orgName key="sxntns">six nations</orgName> of
                    Indians, I have <lb/>undertaken to represent to you the wishes of the indians
                    <lb/>residing at <placeName key="tonne">Tontewanda</placeName>, communicated to
                    me and <lb/>several other friends of <placeName key="farmi"
                        >Farmington</placeName> at a conference <lb/>with us the part <del/>summer
                    or faul. He stated that for a long <lb/>time he had been strongly opposed to
                    their becoming <lb/>civilized or christianized, but that of late he had become
                    <lb/>convinced, as both fishing and hunting, in that part of the <lb/>country,
                    was nearly at an end, that unless they went to work <lb/>and adopted the habits
                    of civilized life, they must starve <lb/>He stated also that some feint attempts
                    had been made <lb/>both by the indians and families towards their civilization
                    but without much ef- <lb/>fect, and that now it was necessary for both friends
                    &amp; <lb/>indians to be in earnest. As a necessary step towards <lb/>the
                    accomplishment of it he conceived it would be <lb/>proper to establish a school,
                    for the education of their chil- <lb/>dren at or near <placeName key="tonne"
                        >Tontewanda</placeName> village.</p>
                <p>He further stated that from long experience they had <lb/>become convinced that
                    full confidence might be placed <lb/>in the society, and enjoined it on us to
                    make their <lb/>sentiments known.</p>
                <p>Some time previous to the conference above mentioned <lb/>I went in company with
                    three other friends, to visit the in- <lb/>dians at the abovementioned place, at
                    their particular <lb/>request. From what we observed while there of their
                    regular <lb/>deportment, the improvements they had made, as well as <lb/>the
                    prudent use they have made of the tools that were given <lb/><pb n="55b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_095"/>to them by friends,
                    we were induced to believe that the <lb/>present is a favorable time for friends
                    to lend them <lb/>some assistance.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to state, that the indians residing <lb/>at <placeName
                        key="tonne">Tontewanda</placeName>, (four hundred and sixty in number)
                    <lb/>say that there are best two or three intemperate persons <lb/>amongst them,
                    and that there is no doubt but it is <lb/>nearly correct.</p>

                <p>Your Letter of 8th Ins. is received and as <lb/>our Committee on Indian Affairs
                    met last week its <lb/>contents were communicated to that body and we were
                    <lb/>desired to answer it--when we invited a conferrence we <lb/>wished it to
                    have taken place before any application <lb/>was made to your Legislature, that
                    the views and intentions <lb/>of each Committee might have been fully
                    understood; our <lb/>field of labour is within the limits of your State and
                    <lb/>whilst your State Legislature permitted those Indians <lb/>under our care
                    to remain quietly subject to the immediate <lb/>direction of the Superintendant
                    appointed by the Executive <lb/>of the United States, our communications were to
                    that <lb/>Department, to which we continue to furnish occasional <lb/>accounts
                    of what has been done and our future prospects, <lb/>and have received
                    encouragement to continue our labours; <lb/>but of late there is a disposition
                    manifest on the part <lb/>of your State to Legislate on the subject, and we feel
                    <lb/>solicitous if any Act is passed it may be such as will <lb/>promote rather
                    than retard their civilization. we <lb/>think if some leading characters in your
                    State were by <lb/>an Act of your Government to have for their neighbours <lb/>a
                    large number of immoral and profligate families and <lb/>were prevented from
                    removing themselves or their children <lb/>to any other part of the State to
                    avoid such contaminating <lb/>example, they would think their case a trying one,
                    and <lb/><pb n="55d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_096"/>is not what is proposed by your House of Assembly <q>to <lb/>induce the
                        several Indian tribes within your State to <lb/>concentrate themselves in
                        some suitable situation</q>to that <lb/>effect--there is much said in the
                    Newspapers of the evil <lb/>conduct of many of the Indians in your State, and
                    should <lb/>they be as bad as represented, it would be improper to
                    <lb/>encourage those who are sober and orderly to receive them <lb/>on their
                    reservations. this is a delicate subject of <lb/>Legislation, but as the Session
                    must now be drawing <lb/>towards a close, we are willing to suggest whether a
                    <lb/>more convenient time for a joint conferrence than <lb/>during the sitting
                    of our Yearly Meeting cannot be agreed <lb/>on, so many Committees meet just
                    previous to the <lb/>Yearly Meeting, and many necessarily between the sitting
                    <lb/>thereof that little time could be allotted to this subject.</p>
                <closer>Such of our friends as feel a concern to attend our <lb/>Yearly Meeting we
                    shall be glad to see, but think this <lb/>subject had better be defer'd to

                <p>Brothers <lb/>We have often endeavoured to press on your <lb/>minds that if you
                    would be willing to improve <lb/>your situation it would very much promote your
                    <lb/>welfare. We are desirous that some of your young <lb/>men would learn the
                    Blacksmith Business and <lb/>our friend and Brother <persName key="acory1">Adin

                    receive them as our friends and your <lb/>friends and that you will open your
                    ears and listen <lb/>to such advice as they may give you, which we hope <lb/>may

                <p>We have received your communication dated <lb/>at <placeName key="utica"
                        >Utica</placeName> and have taken the advice you therein <lb/>gave us, We
                    have waited the return of <persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams
                    </persName><lb/>but he gives us no satisfaction, We are satisfied that <lb/>he
                    is engaged in the service of a speculating company <lb/>who have for their
                    object the routing of the Indians <lb/>from their plantations. We are able to
                    prove that a <lb/>letter has been seen from the Cashier of the Bank at
                        <lb/><placeName key="genev">Geneva</placeName> purporting to be an answer to
                    one sent to <lb/>him by <persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams</persName> in which
                    an application had <lb/>been made to draw 250 Dollars in the name of a certain
                    <lb/>Company (which we forbear to name at this time) <lb/>stating that the
                    company would comply with his <lb/>request only on condition of his removing the

                <p>Father <lb/>We have no disposition to complain unreason- <lb/>ably we wish to do
                    right and we wanted to be treated <lb/>honourably by others and espetially by
                    our Minister <lb/>we have lost our confidence in him we are afraid he <lb/>is
                    not honest We had left in the hands of <persName key="mill1">judge

                    Doll. for hanging it, The <lb/>rest of the money <persName key="willi1">Mr.
                        Williams</persName> by some means or <lb/>other has obtained without our
                    approbation and <lb/>renders no account for it We had designed that <lb/>money
                    to pay for building our Missionary house <lb/>by <persName key="willi1">Mr.
                        Williams</persName> pretended that there was no <lb/>money left and we have
                    had to pay 200 Doll. out of our <lb/>annuity for that Building but we have since
                    aserta- <lb/>ined how the business stands.</p>
                <p>Father, <lb/><persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams</persName> is taking every

                    but we <lb/>are determined not to be ruled by a man of so much <lb/>intrigue</p>
                <p>Father, <lb/>We are not a little astonished at the conduct <lb/>of the man you
                    have sent us for a Teacher We had <lb/>no expectation that he would or could use
                    the <orgName key="oneida">Oneida <lb/>Nation</orgName> as he has done but we
                    think we have now <lb/>found him out and all his plans, He is not contented
                    <lb/>in the place where you sent him but he wants to <lb/>rule and have the
                    command of the whole <orgName key="sxntns">six nations</orgName></p>
                <p>Father <lb/>We wish you to take away this man and give <lb/>us one that is a true
                    Minister of the Gospel we <lb/>dont want a Man that is a speculator for a
                    <lb/>Minister we want a Man that will attend to the <lb/>duties of his holy
                    office and look to good of our <lb/>souls and be content in his station We have
                    no <lb/>design of renouncing our religion we are established <lb/>in the faith,
                    but we want a good Minister to go <lb/>before us, We have many pious old people
                    among <lb/>us whose feelings are much wounded with the cond- <lb/>uct of
                        <persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams</persName> they say they never knew an
                    minis- <lb/>ter conduct as he has done before.</p>
                <p>Father <lb/>We are sory to find that these things have a bad <lb/><pb n="57d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_100"/>affect in the
                    minds of the Indians of other Tribes <lb/>and prejudices them against receiving
                    the Gospel <lb/>They say that they are better off without it than <lb/>we are
                    with it while we are all confusion among <lb/>us they remain in peace</p>
                <p>Father <lb/>We consider ourselves an independant Nation <lb/>and when we get
                    ready to imigrate we will take <lb/>measures among ourselves to secure a Country
                    where <lb/>we think best, We dont want a man to come <lb/>from some other Tribe
                    to persuade and compel us <lb/>to go where he says is best, we wish to choose
                    for <lb/>ourselves we have the right and no man shall take <lb/>it from us and
                    we consider it an insult for any <lb/>man to attempt such a thing. We think we
                    have <lb/>used <persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams</persName> in every respect
                    well, We have <lb/>furnished him with Grain hay and wood besides <lb/>presents
                    in Meat &amp;c eversince he has lived here <lb/>He has also drawn his share in
                    our annuities every <lb/>year and we have given him 150 Acres of Land valued
                    <lb/>at 1500 Doll. and besides all this he receives annualy <lb/>seventy Dollars
                    which is the rent of Lands we have <lb/>let out in <placeName key="westm"
                        >Westmoreland</placeName> which was appropriated by the <lb/>Nation for the

                        <persName key="willi1">Mr. Williams </persName>has complained <lb/>much that
                    he could not live unless we should give him <lb/>more Dollars that the Bishop
                    gave him but little <lb/>But we think if he had been a true chrisian he
                    <lb/>would have been contented <persName key="willi1">Mr. Wlliams</persName>
                    told us <lb/>before he started his journey that the Bishop had <lb/><pb n="57b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_099"/>directed him

                    <lb/>had always told the Nation that they ware not <lb/>worthy to speak to the
                    bishop but we have pres- <lb/>umed to address him as a friend and father</p>
                <p>Father <lb/>We would come to a close by stating that <lb/>the Chiefs of both
                    parties are assembled and unite in <lb/>this request to you for aid in this time

                <p>Our friend <persName key="acory1">Adin T Cory</persName> attended the Monthly
                    <lb/>Meeting of <orgName key="meetscipio">Scipio</orgName>
                    <date when="1822-11-14">14th of 11 Mo. 1822</date> with a certificate <lb/>of
                    removal for himself and wife dated in <date when="1822-09">9 Mo.</date>. <lb/>He
                    suggested to the Meeting the propriety of allowing <lb/>him the priviledge of
                    holding me<gap/>tings among the <lb/>indians when he felt his mind drawn to it
                    which <lb/>was granted.</p>
                <p>In an interview with him he informed <lb/>me that they arrived at <placeName
                        key="onond">Onondaga</placeName> 4 or 5 weeks <lb/>previous--that the
                    principal chief gave up his <lb/>frame house for their use; and that the
                    principal <lb/>men manifested a disposition to promote his views. <lb/>That they
                    had agreed to draw to the Saw-mill this <lb/>winter a sufficient number of logs
                    to erect a <lb/>building of sufficient size for a spinning room, <lb/>a loom
                    room, and a school room. At his request <lb/>I furnished him with eighty Dollars
                    to procure <lb/>blacksmiths tools, Iron and Steel, and a set of <lb/>wheelright
                    tools.</p>
                <p>He expressed a desire that a suitable <lb/>woman might be employed to instruct
                    the children <lb/>in spelling and reading but I did not feel myself
                    <lb/>authorized to instruct him to procure one until I <lb/>had consulted the
                    visiting committee.</p>
                <p>Altho authorized to furnish wool to the <lb/><orgName key="onondaga">Onondaga
                        tribe</orgName>, I did not do it, believing that <lb/>it would be of very
                    little use to them, unless some <lb/>person qualified to instruct them resided
                    with them.</p>

                <p><pb n="57h" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_102"/>It appears by <persName key="acory1">Adin's</persName> statement that he has
                    completely <lb/>gained the confidence of the indians, which they have
                    <lb/>manifested by consulting him on all important subjects, <lb/>more
                    particularly in relation to purchases and sales, and <lb/>by deposition with him
                    notes of hand for collection. We <lb/>have conclu<gap/> to promote the
                    cultivation of flax, and <lb/>have engaged seed. I suggested to <persName
                        key="acory1">Adin</persName> the propriety <lb/>of proposing to them, the
                    application of a part of their <lb/>annuity to the purchase of sheep, which he
                    approved <lb/>of, and it will accordingly be done. Preparatory <lb/>thereto they
                    will be encouraged to enclose a suitable <lb/>piece of land to afford them
                    pastur'd. Adin <lb/>was impressed with the belief that the <orgName
                        key="onondaga">onondaga <lb/>tribe</orgName> possessed 14 yoke of Oxen
                    exclusive of those <lb/>belonging to friends. The old pair of Oxen <lb/>spoken
                    of in last spring's report has been exchanged <lb/>for a young pair, and the
                    difference paid by the <lb/>indians. This tribe possesses a good seat for
                    carding <lb/>machines and a fulling Mill, and it is believed that <lb/>they will
                    be willing to appropriate a part of their <lb/>annuity for their erection when
                    their situation <lb/>may require it.</p>

                <opener>To the great council of our white brothers the <orgName key="nym">Quakers
                        <lb/>in New York.</orgName></opener>
                <p>Brothers <lb/>We met together with our <lb/>brother in council this evening. We
                    thank the great Spirit <lb/>that we have new together once more. We are going to
                    <lb/>say a few words. Our brother called here last winter-- <lb/>we were sorry
                    we could not talk with him because <lb/>there was no interpreter at that time,
                    and we could not <lb/>hear anything that he wished to say. And afterwards
                    <lb/>when he was gone, we thought we would like to have <lb/>said something if
                    we had had an interpreter. And <lb/>now our brother is come we will say all
                    things. <lb/>It is a number of Years since we have heard from you <lb/>You told
                    us to learn to work every time. We are very <lb/>glad. The great Spirit sent you
                    here to give us this <lb/>good advice. You gave us some tools to work <lb/>with,
                    which has been a great help to us, and our young <lb/>men, warriors, begin to
                    work with them. We divided <lb/>the tools amongst us, and some of them are worn
                    <lb/>our. We tell you the reason why they are worn out, <lb/>because we divided
                    them amongst our Young warriors, <lb/>and that makes them ware out quicker. We
                    are thank <lb/>ful because we think the great Spirit make you a mind <lb/>to
                    give them to us. We think we gain a good deal. We <lb/>know different now from
                    what we used to. <gap/></p>
                <p>Brothers <lb/>We will tell you how many cattle and tools <lb/>we have. We have
                    sixty four Yolk of Oxen--and thirty <lb/>one Ploughs and two drags.</p>
                <p>We thought Brothers we woud <lb/>tell you how much trouble we have because we
                    have <lb/>not got tools enough. We have to wait for one another <lb/>We have to
                    drag with bushes instead of Drags because so <lb/>many hurry. You very often,
                    when you come our want <lb/>to know how many tools we want. We never say any
                    <lb/>thing--We thought of it--We thought you know all <lb/>about it. This time
                    we thought we would let you know <lb/>what tools we have. If you wish to help us
                    to some more <lb/>we are very glad.</p>
                <p>Brothers, You often, when you come out here <lb/>told us we had better leave off
                    drinking the bad liquor <lb/>We did very often. We talked with our Young
                    warriors to quit <lb/>they most all did--some wont believe <del/>. We hope we
                    <lb/>shall get strength before long. Brothers, You often give us <lb/>good
                    council and advice to keep our land. We united, all <lb/>our nation, to keep
                    this land, and to lay our bones on it <lb/>and our childrens too. Brothers, we
                    look to you! we wish <lb/>you to come and instruct us, because You know our <del/>
                    <lb/><pb n="59b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_105"/>darkness. And learn and children to read and till the ground <lb/>and our
                    women to spin and make cloth. We wish if you <lb/>will to take three of our boys
                    and learn them, one to be <lb/>a Blacksmith and two to read and write. We want
                    them <lb/>sent away off. We wish to hear from you. We want to <lb/>know what you
                    think about what we say.</p>

                <p>I received some time ago your letter of the 5th inst. covering <lb/>the copy of a

                <p>I would have replied sooner to your communications, but <lb/>the state of my

                    of the Reservations <lb/>has started various objections to it and has been doing
                    every thing in his <lb/>power to prevent its going into effect. But this conduct
                    of his is dis- <lb/>approved of by the rest of the Chiefs, who are perfectly
                    satisfied with the <lb/>sale they have made &amp; complain bitterly that
                        <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> should have <lb/>influence
                    enought to interpose any difficulties to the great and respectable <lb/>body of
                    the nation.</p>
                <p>I received two days ago a communication from the principal <lb/>chiefs of the
                    nation in which they complain very much of the conduct <lb/>of <persName
                        key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> and declare that the statements he makes
                    respecting the late <lb/>treaty are utterly unfounded and that they are
                    determined that it shall <lb/>be carried into effect.</p>
                <p>As I have stated before, I have been acquainted with all <lb/>the negotiations
                    between the proprietors &amp; the Indians respecting this <lb/>purchase and have
                    no hesitation in saying that it has been conduc- <lb/>ted with perfect fairness,
                    openness and propriety and that it met, &amp; <lb/>ought to have met the
                    approbation of every chief whose opinion and <lb/>influence were of any weight.
                    No threats or menaces or bribes <lb/>were made use of to my knowledge: but as in
                    every case of the kind <lb/>certain gratuities were made after the conclusion of
                    the treaty to the prin- <lb/>cipal chiefs. This is a matter of course in all
                    purchases from the <lb/>Indians as is well known to the United States, and it is
                    Expected <lb/>by the nation that their Chiefs are to receive presents on all
                    such <lb/>occasions.</p>
                <p><persName key="redja1">Red Jackets</persName> conduct in this business as in
                    almost every other in <lb/>which he now engages is extremely offensive to the
                    other chiefs. And he <lb/>is urged to this opposition by white people who are
                    libing in the <lb/>neighborhood of the Reservations and whose interest is
                    concerned in <lb/>preventing a sale of them. But I am satisfied that <persName
                        key="redja1">Red Jackets</persName>
                    <lb/>complaints against the treaty are entirely unfounded and that the

                    its wishes will be consulted <lb/>in carrying it into Effect.</p>

                <p>I received your letter of the 26th ultimo with the <lb/>enclosed memorial from
                        <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> and others on the subject

                    holding the same. <lb/>That five days thereafter I arrived at <placeName
                        key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName> for <lb/>the purpose of making a
                    distribution of the auunity in <lb/>goods from the U. States to the Indians,

                    <lb/>to <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName> I was particularly requested
                    by the proprietors <lb/>of the pre-emptive right at the <gap/> of <persName

                    <lb/>I must be there until 15th.</p>

                    public councils held thereafter until the conclusion <lb/>of the treaty. That
                    during the negotiation I had no private <lb/>conversations with the Indians and

                    treaty was concluded between the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca nation</orgName>
                    of Indians, <lb/>and the proprietors of the preemptive right, to their

                        >Massachusetts</placeName>, one <lb/>for the proprietors, and one for the
                    Chiefs of the <orgName key="seneca">Senecas</orgName>; <lb/>all of which were
                    lodged with me as escrows, to take effect <lb/>and to be delivered, as soon as
                    the grantees should secure <lb/>in the public stocks or funds of the United
                    States, an <lb/>annual annuity or income, of two thousand five hundred <lb/>and
                    eighty three dollars, to and for the benefit of the said <lb/><orgName
                        key="seneca">Seneca Nation </orgName>of Indians.</p>
                <p>I am now informed by the agents or trustees of the proprie- <lb/>tors, that they
                    are prepared to carry the treaty into effect, <lb/>and to that end, I have been
                    requested to forward you a <lb/>copy thereof, which I have the honor herewith to
                    <lb/>enclose.</p>
                <p>The treaty was attended and executed by all the <lb/>principal, and even minor
                    chiefs of the tribe, <lb/>with the exception of one or two, who were absent at
                    <lb/>the time. <persName key="jjame2">Dr. Jacob Jimeson</persName>, an educated
                    native, <lb/>also a young man of great worth, and of highly respecta- <lb/>ble
                    literary attainments, officiated as principal inter- <lb/>preter, and was
                    employed by me as such, in consequence <lb/><pb n="61b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_111"/>of the perfect knowledge which he
                    possessed of the English, <lb/>as well as his native language. The proposals
                    made by <lb/>the agent of the proprietors, to the Chiefs in council, <lb/>were
                    fully explained to them; and they were distinctly ad- <lb/>vised by me, that if
                    a sale was made, it must be a <lb/>voluntary act on their part, as they were at
                    perfect liberty, <lb/>to sell their lands or to retain them, as they should
                    <lb/>under the circumstances think expedient and proper.</p>
                <p><persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName>, opposed the sale, of any of the
                    Indian <lb/>lands, from commencement of the negotiation. There- <lb/>fore, after
                    the treaty was committed to writing, and <lb/>ready to be executed, he was
                    advised by me, that <lb/>if on mature reflection, his opinion should remain
                    <lb/>unchanged, he ought not to sign it, as his name <lb/>and seal would be
                    evidence of approbation, and <lb/>could not be contradicted. It was there read,
                    <lb/>article by article, in presence of myself, <persName key="wgosh1">W. N.

                    misunderstood. Having been <lb/>there read, explained, and declared to be
                    satisfactory, <lb/>it was executed by every one of the chiefs present.</p>
                <p>Having understood that <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName>, together
                    <lb/>with a number of the <orgName key="tonaw">Tonewanta Indians</orgName> (most
                    of <lb/>whom are not Chiefs) had procured a remonstrance <lb/>to be drawn at
                        <placeName key="butav">Butavia</placeName>, a village about forty <lb/>miles
                    East of this place; which remonstrance <lb/>they had signed, and caused to be
                    forwarded to <lb/>the seat of Government, I thought it my duty thus <lb/>briefly
                    to state the facts in relation to the treaty, <lb/>and in which every person
                    present will fully con- <lb/>cur. I was aware at the time, that a few of the
                    <lb/>Indians who were scattered over the small reservations <lb/>upon the
                        <placeName key="genes2">Genesee river</placeName>, and a part of the
                        <orgName key="tonaw">Tonnewan- <lb/>tas</orgName>, were opposed to the
                    proceeding; but they compose <lb/>a very small proportion of the tribe, and have
                    very <lb/>little weight in its councils. As it regards these <lb/>people, I am
                    satisfied the sale is a beneficial <lb/>one, and believe the stipulated annuity,
                    equal to <lb/>the fair value of the lands sold, including the <lb/>amount paid
                    for the preemption right. I beg to be <lb/>advised of the receipt of the treaty,
                    and of the <lb/>fulfilment of the Conditions thereof, on the part <lb/>of the

                    belong.</p>
                <p>The memorial purports to have been <lb/>made and signed at the Council House of
                    the nation; <lb/>but there has been no council at that place for such
                    <lb/>purpose. <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> however, did as I am
                    informed, <lb/>assemble his adherents upon the <placeName key="tonne"
                        >Tennewanta</placeName> reser- <lb/>vation, to advise upon the subject of
                    (breaking up as <lb/>he termed it) the treaty. The memorial might <lb/>have been
                    made and signed at that time; but I <lb/>strongly suspect it was subsequently
                    done at the Village <lb/>of <placeName key="balan">Balania</placeName>. Who the
                    author was I am at a loss to con- <lb/>jecture. It could not have been <persName
                        key="adams1">Mr. Adams</persName>, in <lb/>whose presence it appears to have
                    been signed, because <lb/>he is a man of very moderate literary attainments,
                    <lb/>much less indeed than the grammar &amp; orthography of <lb/>the production
                    disclosed.</p>
                <p><pb n="61e" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_113"/>There are but few of the signers who <lb/>are known to me as chiefs; and all of
                    them must have <lb/>been grossly imposed upon, by some designing villian,
                    <lb/>with a view to embarrass the executive, as well as to harrass <lb/>and
                    injure the proprietors. In addition to this, it must <lb/>have been done by some
                    person totally ignorant of the <lb/>Indians, or destitute of all regard for
                    veracity, if an <lb/>opinion in that respect can be formed from the ab-
                    <lb/>surdity of the statements which were made. It will <lb/>be seen from the
                    memorial, that 2606 are opposed to <lb/>the Treaty--430 in favor of it--3036 in
                    all, who must <lb/>be at least old enough, to express an opinion as to <lb/>the
                    advantages and disadvantages resulting from the <lb/>sale of their lands, when
                    in truth, the whole <orgName key="seneca">seneca <lb/>nation</orgName> does not
                    number 3000 souls.</p>
                <p>In regard to the language imputed <lb/>to me, I can only say, it was never used,
                    now did I <lb/>ever hold a private conversation with <persName key="redja1">Red
                        Jacket</persName> upon <lb/>the subject of the Treaty, as stated by him: but
                    a <lb/>short time previous to the assemblage of the Chiefs, I <lb/>did something
                    in the manner set forth, decline an interview <lb/>for reasons obvious to every
                    one, who knows the man as <lb/>well as I do.</p>
                <p>No threats were used to induce a sale, <lb/>nor did <persName key="jgrei1">Mr.
                        Greig</persName> intimate a wish or expectiation of <lb/>purchasing, but by
                    the voluntary consent of the chiefs, <lb/>who were distinctly informed, and well
                    understood, that <lb/>the Government would protect them in their possessions.
                    <lb/>They had no apprehension of an ultimate failure of <lb/>that protection,
                    nor was there on the part of <persName key="jgrei1">Mr. Greig</persName>,
                    <lb/>the remotest insinuation, that coercive measures would <lb/>be resulted to.
                    I heard none of the expressions alledged <lb/>to have been made by Mess.
                        <persName key="parr2">Parrish</persName>
                    <persName key="hjone1">Jones</persName> &amp; <persName key="gclut1"
                        >Clute</persName>, and <lb/>my implicit belief is, the charges against them
                    have <lb/>no foundation in truth.</p>
                <p><persName key="jjame2">Doc. Jamieson</persName>, an educated native <lb/>of great
                    respectability attended the treaty, and was employ- <lb/>ed by me as an
                    interpreter. He is now at Green <lb/>Bay with a number of the <orgName
                        key="seneca">Seneca </orgName>Chiefs, and will <lb/>probably attend the
                    treaty, to be held by Governor <lb/>Cass in the vicinity of that place. Soon as
                    he <lb/><pb n="61g" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_114"/>returns, you will be more fully informed, relative <lb/>to the
                    complaints of <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> and his associates.
                    <lb/>As to the charge of bribery, I know nothing, nor do <lb/>I beleive a word
                    of it.</p>
                <p>Small annuities might have been <lb/>allowed the principal chiefs; but the
                    payment of such <lb/>gratuities, I believe has been practised under every
                    <lb/>treaty with Indian tribes of this state, since the organ- <lb/>ization of
                    its government. It is a subject well un- <lb/>derstood by them, and no chief has
                    participated so <lb/>extensively in such largesses, as <persName key="redja1"
                        >Red Jacket</persName> himself. <lb/>Allowances here may have been
                    stipulated, as there were <lb/>at the Treaty of 1797, but<persName key="jgrei1"
                        >Mr. Greig</persName> as a man of the <lb/>most unquestionable integrity;
                    and I speak with <lb/>great confidence when I say, he sooned have spurned
                    <lb/>the idea of offering a dollar to <persName key="redja1">Red
                        Jacket</persName> or to any <lb/>other Chief, in the shape of a bribe: and I
                    trust it <lb/>will not for a moment be believed, that money <lb/>was solicited
                    at his hands, or proffered by him as <lb/>the wages of corruption.</p>
                <p>It is true, that <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> was <lb/>opposed
                    <lb/>opposed to the sale of the Indian Lands, and every part <lb/>of them; and
                    it is equally true, that he finally assented <lb/>to the sale, and is among
                    those who executed the deed <lb/>of cession. My letter of the <date
                        when="1827-01-30">30th of January last</date>, <lb/>which accompanied the
                    treaty transmitted to the President, <lb/>explains the course taken, to insure a
                    thorough knowledge <lb/>of its contents, on part of the chiefs, and to that I
                    refer <lb/>you for information. Upon the whole subject, there <lb/>was great
                    unanimity of sentiment among the chiefs-- <lb/>The proceedings were frank, open,
                    fair and satisfactory to <lb/>the contracting parties. The Indians have in good
                    faith, <lb/>quietly and readily fulfilled the terms of their contract, <lb/>so
                    far as they have been called upon to act; &amp; notwithstanding <lb/>in their
                    memorial, they are made to utter murmers <q>loud and deep</q>, to sanction
                    falshoods of the most <lb/>extraordinary character, and to express a most
                    decided <lb/>determination not, to receive the pay for their lands, <lb/>yet
                    when the agent came to settle the annuities of the <lb/>nation, all were
                    received without difficulty or complaint.</p>
                <p>Indian settlements surrounded by a <lb/>white population, like those in the state
                    of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>, <lb/><pb n="61i" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_115"/>are always annoyed by the
                    very dregs of civilized <lb/>society, who are often found hanging upon the
                    skirts <lb/>of the chiefs, and in some instances, are the associates <lb/>of the
                    most abandoned of that unfortunate people. <lb/>From considerations of gain,
                    others more respectable <lb/>are induced, to excite their jealousies and awaken
                    <lb/>their apprehensions, by misrepresenting the objects of <lb/>the Government,
                    as well as the conduct of its agents.</p>
                <p>They advise councils, write Indian- <lb/>talks or speeches for them, which
                    seldom, if ever <lb/>fail of betraying the feelings and vicios of the
                    author.</p>
                <p>Had there been no such men, the <lb/>memorial in question would never have been
                    <lb/>heard of, not the statements it contains have been <lb/>fabricated.</p>

                <p>The Committee on Indian Concerns report, that, at their <lb/>concluding sitting,
                    at the time of our last Yearly Meeting, <lb/>they appointed a committee to
                    attend and sit with the Com- <lb/>mittee of Indians, at the time of their
                    approaching Yearly <lb/>Meeting; and by a copy of the minutes of that Committee,
                    <lb/>and the report of our friends who attended, it appears that <lb/>the
                    Committees of the several Yearly Meetings are harmo- <lb/>niously united in the
                    prosecution of the benevolent object. <lb/>An interesting account of the
                    proceedings of the Committee <lb/>of <placeName key="indiana"
                        >Indiana</placeName> since last year, has been lately received--and in
                    <lb/>order that the most material parts of their communication <lb/>may be
                    spread before the Yearly Meeting, the following <lb/>extracts are made from it,
                    viz.</p>
                <p>Early in the spring of the present year, we received an <lb/>account of the
                    donation of <persName key="untha1">Dr. Unthank</persName> having been receiv-
                    <lb/>ed by our Agent in <placeName key="cinci">Cincinnati</placeName>, and on
                    the receipt of which <lb/>information, we immediately proceed to purchase house-
                    <lb/>hold and kitchen furniture, farming utensils, a quantity of
                    <lb/>provisions, &amp;c. in order to enable us to carry into execution <lb/>the
                    plan of operations agreed upon. We also employed a <lb/>family, <persName
                        key="mpear1">Moses Pearson</persName> and wife, Friends, as Superintend-
                    <lb/>ents, and employed a young woman (a Friend) to assist in <lb/>the family.
                    By the report of a deputation who recently <lb/>visisted the Indians, you will
                    observe that a young man (a <lb/>Friend) has been employed as a Teacher for a
                    time: and <lb/>we have a Committee appointed to employ another teacher <lb/>to
                    be in readiness to take his place, when the time for which <lb/>he has engaged
                    shall have expired. Our deputation to visit <lb/>the Indians, made the following
                    report, together with a letter <lb/>received form our Superintendent since their
                    return. The <lb/>Report is as follows, viz. We have attended to the appoint-
                    <lb/>ment, and agree to report, that on arriving at the intended
                    <lb/>establishment, we found that <persName key="mpear1">Moses
                        Pearson</persName> and family had <lb/>been there about five days, were all
                    well, but in an uncom- <lb/>fortable situation in consequence of the house not
                    being <lb/><gap/>, and the goods that had been shipped not having <lb/>then come
                    to hand. The Superintendent had purchased about <lb/>five acres of corn, and
                    theg were busily engaged in working <lb/>amongst it. We engaged <persName
                        key="enewb1">Elias Newby</persName> (a Friend) as <lb/>Teacher, &amp;c. for
                    the term of four months, at twenty four <lb/>dollars per month--and if his
                    relations approved of his re- <lb/>maining until next Spring, he was to stay and
                    receive twen- <lb/>ty dollars per month. Owing to the situation of the house
                    <lb/>and family, we thought it best not to convene the Indians <lb/>in council
                    there; but we had an interview with them at <lb/>their Council House, in
                    presence of the Agent, who had a <lb/>considerable number of them collected on
                    business. They <lb/>appeared much pleased with the opportunity of meeting
                    <lb/>with us; they generally looked well, spoke highly of their <lb/>country,
                    and from what we could learn from seeing many<lb/>of their farms, and the
                    information received otherwise, we <lb/>conclude that they are in a much better
                    way of living than <lb/>they were in <placeName key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>.
                    They appeared much more sensible <lb/>of the advantages of civilization, and
                    many of them mani- <lb/>fest a disposition to excel their neighbors in
                    agriculture.-- <lb/>On conferring with them respecting a school, they appeared
                    <lb/>to be much pleased, and said they would furnish as many <lb/>children as we
                    wanted, when the house and teacher were <lb/>ready to receive them.</p>
                <p>There are two missionaries amongst them--a <orgName key="metho"
                        >Methodist</orgName>
                    <lb/>and a <orgName key="bapt">Baptist</orgName>.</p>
                <p>It might probably be interesting to the committee, to be <lb/>informed of the
                    cause of the Indians being convened by the <lb/>agent; which was, to lay before
                    them a proposition from <lb/>the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>, the
                    substance of which was, that govern- <lb/>ment was willing, with their
                    approbation, to lay off a large <lb/>tract of country sufficient to contain a
                    number of Nations <lb/>of Indians, and to give them a warrantee deed for the
                    same, <lb/>(describing the boundaries)--that said tract of country <lb/>should
                    be known by the title of Indians' Country--that no <lb/>white man should have
                    any right within the said bounda- <lb/>ries, except his business was sanctioned
                    be government--<lb/>that the Indians should have the privilege of making their
                    own <lb/>laws (recommending some laws which it was thought best <lb/>for them to
                    enact)--that government would be at the ex- <lb/>pense of building them a good
                    substantial council house-- <lb/>that each nation should send one or more of
                    their number, <lb/>yearly, to said house, there to confer on such subjects as
                    they <lb/>may be interested in--that they should annually elect one of
                    <lb/>their number to congress, there to remain during the ses- <lb/>sion, to
                    represent the whole of the nations residing in their <lb/>country--that
                    government would pay all expenses in going <lb/>to, while remaining at, and
                    returning from, the seat of gov- <lb/>ernment. The Agent informed us the
                    proposition had <lb/>been submitted to several nations, and that they had agreed
                    <lb/>to them without hesitation, although the <orgName key="shawanee"
                        >Shawnese</orgName> did not <lb/>accede to the propositions at that time,
                    but set a time when <lb/>they would give him an answer.</p>
                <p>On our parting with <persName key="jperr2">John Perry</persName>, the head chief,
                    he spoke <lb/>as follows, viz.: <said who="jperr2">When you get home, tell my
                        Friends, <lb/>the Quakers, that I am their friend, and shall be as long
                        as<lb/>I live, and when I am laid in the ground, I hope my chil- <lb/>dren
                        will be your friends. When we lived in Ohil, where <lb/>we could get game, I
                        thought not worth the while to send my <lb/>children to school, and I sent
                        none; but now we live where <lb/>we cannot get game, I want my children to
                        go to school, <lb/>and learn to work too.</said></p>
                <p>The following is an extract of the letter alluded to from <lb/>the Superintendent
                    of the establishment, dated <date when="1837-07-12">12th of 7th
                    <lb/>last</date>, viz.: <said>We attended the council of the <orgName
                            key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName> to- <lb/>day, and they have answered
                        the Agent, and informed him <lb/>that, after deliberating on the subjects
                        laid before them, <lb/>they were willing the propositions should be put exe-
                        <lb/>cution as soon as practicable, and they have signed an a- <lb/>greement
                        to that effect to go before conress. The <orgName key="shawnee">Shaw-
                            <lb/>nese</orgName> also states, while in the council, that they had
                        confer- <lb/>red together respecting the two Missionaries that are with
                        <lb/>them--that they had come to the conclusion to info <lb/>them that they
                        knew the Quakers were their friends--<gap/>
                        <lb/>when they went to move away from amongst them, they <lb/>left all, and
                        took nothing away with them; and <gap/>this they <lb/>knew that they were
                        friends, and that the Quakers <lb/>had sent on their Teachers (pointing at
                            <persName key="enewb1">Elias Newby</persName> and <lb/>myself) to learn
                        their children, and that they wished THEM <lb/>to learn their children--that
                        they wished (one of the Mis- <lb/>sionaries mentioned) to move his mission
                        out amongst another <lb/>tribe of Indians; and the other, to move his
                        mission some- <lb/>where else. They seem to put full confidence in friends
                        doing <lb/>all they stand in need of in the way of Education. My
                        <lb/>feelings are easier conceived than described, when I con- <lb/>sider
                        the limited situation of our funds, the confidence the <lb/>Indians have in
                        us, and the backward situation of our school, <lb/>and that they are
                        dismissing the Missionaries to make way <lb/>for us. Several of the Indians
                        have spoken to me, to know <lb/>how soon the school will commence, and
                        appear anxious <lb/>how soon. In taking into consideration the peculiarly
                        in- <lb/>teresting state of the concern at present, by which it ap-
                        <lb/>pears that the objects of our concern are in a prosperous
                        <lb/>condition as regards their agricultural pursuits--that they <lb/>are so
                        anxious to have their children educated by Friends, <lb/>that they have
                        dismissed the Missionaries to make way <lb/>for us--and having been, at this
                        time, made remewedly sen- <lb/>sible of the obligations resting upon us, not
                        only to instruct <lb/>them in the truths of the Chrisitan Religion, but also
                        to <lb/>give them assistance in literary and agricultural pursuits; <lb/>the
                        Committee, under a solemn consideration of the sub- <lb/>ject, unite in
                        proposing to the Yearly Meeting, that liberal <lb/>contributions in aid of
                        the funds be entered into, in order to <lb/>enable us to carry on this
                        interesting and benevolent work, <lb/>with a hope that a blessing will

                        <lb/>Dear friend</salute></opener>
                <p>Thy letter of <date when="1837-04-19">4 mo. 19</date> was received in due
                    <lb/>time, and several Friends were consulted on the subjects <lb/>of it.
                    Wishing however to have the matter more fully inves- <lb/>tigated previous to an
                    answer being made, a delay until 6 mo. <lb/>1. was concluded on, about which
                    time our meeting for <lb/>suffering met. I was sick at the time, and sent the
                    letter <lb/>to the meeting; it was mislaid among the members; and <lb/>I was
                    totally at a loss about it until the late meeting <lb/>(a few days past) when I
                    found the letter again. I hope <lb/>this may explain to thee the cause of the
                    vexatious delay.</p>
                <p>The Indian concern is one of deep interest, and I look <lb/>upon it that much
                    good can be done to this people, by <lb/>the right kind of labours from Friends.
                    No people as <lb/>I think possess the confidence of the Indians to the <lb/>same
                    extent as Friends; and so far as Friends have <lb/>kept themselves apart from
                    the heat of party politics, <lb/>none, as I believe, could have greater
                    influence with <lb/>the <orgName key="usag">Govenment</orgName> in this matter.
                    The <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> has <lb/>been kind to our people,
                    and has shown a decided dis- <lb/>position to countenance their efforts.
                    Secretary <gap/>, <lb/>of the War Department, in particular. The Commissioners
                    <lb/>and other agents of the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> are
                    frequently <lb/>corrupt; and seem to feel themselves set up to get the <lb/>best
                    bargain out to their people (the Indians) that they <lb/>can, too little
                    regarding, in many cases, as I fear, that <lb/>some Christian principles of
                    doing as they would be done <lb/><pb n="63d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_119"/>unto. The question of the removing of the
                    Indians to the far <lb/>west, is one of a very interesting nature. Located in
                    the <lb/>middle of the organised states, they are thrown into continual
                    <lb/>collisions with the surrounding inhabitants, and mutual animosities
                    <lb/>are apt to exist between them. Petitions are raised by the whites <lb/>to
                    have the Indians <q>bought out</q>
                    <gap/><orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> is solicited <lb/>by individuals
                    and by the state legislaters, which is guided by the <lb/>people; State laws are
                    extended over their country by a right <lb/>common to the State Governments,
                    which it is believed the Gen. <lb/>Gov. is bound to maintain. Comm. are appt. to
                    treat with <lb/>the Indians for purchase, &amp;c. &amp;c. till they must yeild.
                    <lb/>All this is an instigation of the people, not a disposition <lb/>of the
                        <orgName key="usag">Gov</orgName>. originally, until they are under
                    necessity to notice the <lb/>subject from the people. The <orgName key="usag"
                        >Gov</orgName>. being bound in treaties <lb/>to the Indians for their
                    protection, finds itself in difficulties <lb/>and hence the scheme for inducing
                    the Indians to remove <lb/>out of the chatred limits of any state--with a
                    promise <lb/>that their territoy beyond the <geogName key="missi"
                        >Mississippi</geogName> shall never more <lb/>be included in the bounds of
                    any state, but secured to them <lb/>as an undisturbed possission. The map which
                    thou <lb/>mentions in thy letter, and a copy of which I will send thee
                    <lb/>herewith will show thee what progress the <orgName key="usag"
                    >Gov</orgName>. has made <lb/>in their western locations &amp;c. &amp;c. Thou
                    wilt see that the <lb/>territory of the <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawanese</orgName> is but a small one, compared with <lb/>the mighty
                    west--indeed the tribe is small--say only <lb/>about 1200. On this small tribe
                    the whole forces of <lb/>the philanthropy of <orgName key="bym"

                    they eye over the map, and see the mighty field <lb/>for labour. We have in the
                    heart of our state a tribe <lb/>of <orgName key="miami">Miami Indians</orgName>,
                    about 2000 strong--with Friends near <lb/>there or several sides--towards there,
                    it is my opinion that we <lb/>should extend some attention.</p>
                <p>I answer thy inquiries. <list>
                        <item>1st In answer to this, I send thee a periodical called <lb/><gap/>
                            Annual Registrar--a work of much information.</item>
                        <item>2nd The Tribes mostly have missionaries with them.</item>
                        <item>3rd Friends carry on their operation by permission of the Gov.
                            <lb/>and perhaps it may be said with the co-operation of the Agent
                            <lb/>to a certain extent. They certainly might carry on their operations
                            with <lb/>the co-operation of the <orgName key="usag"
                            >Gov</orgName>.</item>
                        <item>4. I believe not.</item>
                        <item>5. So far as our operations are extended, your money would be
                            <lb/>very useful to us--but we apprehend that you could personally
                            <lb/>render us very little assistance.</item>
                        <item>6. I think there are, several. The <orgName key="miami"
                                >Miamis</orgName> in particular.</item>
                        <item>7. A combined effort of the Yearly Meetings might be <lb/>productive
                            of much more good, as it would add so much <lb/>strength to the
                            concern--and put those who might be the <lb/>immediate agents of the
                            work in so much more means <lb/>for extending their usefulness.</item>
                        <item>The project of having a kind of general Agent, a <lb/>member of our
                            society, might not be a bad one--but the contrary <lb/>one thing,
                            however--we must suppose the <orgName key="usag">Gov</orgName>. has

                            them, <lb/>but we should render ourselves odious, and have the
                            opposition <lb/>of all. It would, I think be better to enter the field
                            as <lb/>Assistants in the great work of Christianization, and then do
                            <lb/>good as way might open.</item>

                <p>We the undersigned Sachems, Chiefs, and Chief Warriors <lb/>of the <orgName
                        key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName> assembled in Council at the Council
                    <lb/>house on <placeName key="buffc">Buffalo Creek Reservation</placeName> in
                    the State of <placeName key="newyo">New <lb/>York</placeName>, Present the
                    following Communication for the <lb/>purpose of saying to our Father the
                    President, That <lb/><persName key="ische1">I.J.Schermerhorn</persName> United
                    States Commissioner, having <lb/>been appointed to remove the New York Indians
                    to the <lb/>West; In <date when="1837-07">July last</date> he passed through all
                    the settle- <lb/>ments of the <orgName key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName> and
                    took with him some of <lb/>our men of his own selection, for the purpose of
                    forming <lb/>An exploring party to the West. This was his own <lb/>delegation
                    and not ours. We consider this an unlawful <lb/>and improper exercise of
                    authority which strikes at the very <lb/>fundamental principles of our laws and
                    treaties. We <lb/>cannot therefore recognize persons so selected as regular
                    <lb/>appointed delegates.</p>
                <p>Father--We will now explain to you our minds on <lb/>the subject. We have not any
                    desire of again exploring <lb/>the Western Country. The repetition can confer on
                    us <lb/>no benefit inasmuch as we have still the same de- <lb/>termination to
                    remain upon the premises which we now <lb/>hold in the <placeName key="newyo"
                        >State of New York</placeName></p>
                <p>Father--We have concluded a treaty of peace more than forty <lb/>years ago, which
                    we still adhere to for our guide. In <lb/>that treaty we have mutually
                    stipulated that all our <lb/>national transactions should be performed in open
                    Council. <lb/>This stipulation was agreed to by the parties mutually. <lb/>In
                    that Treaty all secret meetings to transact national <lb/><pb n="65b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_122"/>business are
                    forbidden.</p>
                <p>Father In that Treaty we agreed that no compulsion should <lb/>be used by either
                    of the parties. But now <persName key="ische1">I.J. Schermerhorn</persName>
                    <lb/>has already used as it were force in taking our men to the <lb/>West
                    clandestinely. Furthermore we believe that comm- <lb/>unications have been
                    dispatched to you purporting to be the <lb/>voice of the <orgName key="sxntns"
                        >Six Nations</orgName>, but which in reality have not been <lb/>acted upon
                    in our Councils.</p>
                <p>Father-- We sincerely hope that all such (if any there may be) <lb/>may not be
                    considered or treated as the sentiments of the <orgName key="sxntns">Six
                        <lb/>Nations</orgName>. We will now acquaint you with our views res-
                    <lb/>pecting the removal of our people west of the <geogName key="missi"
                        >Mississippi</geogName>
                    <lb/>We have resolved to adhere to our present locations to remain <lb/>and lay
                    our bones by the side of our forefathers.</p>
                <p>We believe we can continue at home and be at <lb/>peace with our neighbours. We
                    have disposed of our lands <lb/>again and again until our seats are reduced so
                    that they <lb/>are now but just sufficient for our children to live on. <lb/>We
                    are now surrounded on every side by the White People. <lb/>We love them and
                    suffer no inconvenience from them; but <lb/>on the Contrary, we desire from them
                    great and permanent <lb/>assistance. They are kind and generous hearted people,
                    <lb/>they treat us kindly.</p>
                <p>We believe that we have fulfilled our obligations to each other <lb/>and to the
                    treaty of Peace and Friendship which we made. <lb/>We have been born and
                    educated in the same land, we have <lb/>grown up together in brotherly love; We
                    have acquired a <lb/>knowledge of the arts of civilization and of agriculture in
                    a <lb/>great measure from them: We have now many amongst us <lb/>who have built
                    large barns, and who have good waggons <lb/>and other useful implements of
                    agriculture. We have also <lb/>built school and Council houses and convenient
                    Churches: <lb/>We have several saw mills and a grain mill amongst us. <lb/>Our
                    people have made rapid advances already and are still <lb/>progressing in wealth
                    and industry.</p>
                <p>The moral condition of our people has been visibly <lb/>improving beyond our
                    expectation for the last forty years: <lb/>True we have also immoral and
                    imprincipled men amongst <lb/>us: But this is common with all nations. There is
                    therefore <lb/>no sufficient reason for the whole nation to be removed <lb/>on
                    their account.</p>
                <p>Father--One more, We have heard your liberal offers <lb/>in connection with your
                    instructions to your agent read <lb/>to us by <persName key="stryk1">Judge
                        Stryker</persName>. We have understood them well. <lb/>But with all the
                    light thus thrown upon the subject we cannot <lb/>see sufficient reasons for
                    accepting them. We believe that <lb/>our comforts here are better than the
                    Western territory can <lb/>offer us. We know that from the sincerity of their
                    hearts <lb/>our people do not wish to accept, and it would be heart <lb/>rending
                    for us and our people to be induced to do so con- <lb/>trary to our voices and
                    feelings.</p>
                <p>Father We have been repeatedly assured by all the Presidents <lb/>and even by
                    your predecessor, that the right of choice <lb/>should be left entirely free.
                    That we may go or stay <lb/>as we choose. We believe our new father will follow
                    <lb/>the steps of the wide and good Presidents who have gone <lb/>before: We
                    suppose that the people have elected a good <lb/>and philanthropic man for their
                    chief magistrated <lb/>We therefore hope sincerely, that you will suffer no
                    improper <lb/>means to be used for seducing our people to acquiesee <lb/>in the
                    proposition made by our agent.</p>
                <p>Father, Permit us now in closind this letter to commend <lb/>your health and
                    soundness of spirit to the care of the great <lb/>Spirit of Heaven.</p>

                <p>We yesterday Rec. a letter from <lb/>a number of the chiefs of the Indians
                    Settled on <lb/>the <placeName key="alleg2">Allegheny Reservation</placeName> in

                    U.S. agent had been there <lb/>&amp; held a council in which he told them they
                    must <lb/>sell their lands &amp; remove to the West of the <placeName
                        key="missi">Mis- <lb/>sissippi</placeName>--that the <orgName key="usag"
                        >U.S. government</orgName> was resolved <lb/>to remove them from where they
                    now were--that <lb/>every chief who would influenced 100 persons to agree
                    <lb/>to go, should receive $500 dollars premium, &amp; <lb/>that the <orgName
                        key="usag">government</orgName> had resolved to stop their <lb/>annuity
                    until they removed westward--that <lb/>those who removed would receive the
                    annuity<lb/>but those who did not would get nothing.</p>
                <p>Aided by the <orgName key="ogden">Ogden Company</orgName> he used <lb/>every
                    exertion to prevail on them to assent to <lb/>the measure, &amp; after having
                    occupied nearly <lb/>the whole time of the Council for 8 days, he <lb/>requested
                    an answer. The chiefs &amp; head men were <lb/><pb n="67b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_125"/>generally determined on staying
                    &amp; told him so. <lb/>He then came into Council--Said the business <lb/>was
                    finished--you have sold all your claimed <lb/>in this State--<said who="ische1"
                        >Here is the treaty made &amp; written <lb/>before you, and are all you have
                        to do is to Sign <lb/>it</said>. He then laid the Treaty on the table &amp;
                    <lb/>called on the chiefs to sign it. The <orgName key="seneca"
                        >Senecas</orgName>
                    <lb/>then laid on the table a remonstrance they <lb/>had prepared against his
                    proceedings and 62 <lb/>of their chiefs signed it--23 of them who <lb/>were in
                    favour of emigration Signed the treaty <lb/>The commissioner Staid two or three

                    &amp; then induced them to do so. <lb/>The Senecas have determined to carry

                    would furnish one years provision money to defray the expence of moving
                    <lb/>them there, build them houses, Mills, Meeting Houses, School houses, Black-
                    <lb/>smiths shops, and furnish them with Missionaries. When you receive this
                    <lb/>offer, all your Annuity will be removed to the far Country, If any Indians
                    remain <lb/>here, They will get no money as there will be no Agent here. But
                    there will be <lb/>one sent to the west--who will attend all your Councils
                    there--you must <lb/>except of this offer--you must go. He occupied the whole
                    time in talking <lb/>for the first eight days of the Council. After we had
                    deliberated on what <lb/>he had said to us--and determined on remaining where we
                    are. The Com- <lb/>missioner said we have finished. You have sold all that you
                    have <lb/>claimed, here is the Treaty made and written before you--and all you
                    <lb/>have to do, is to sign it. He then laid the treaty on the Table, at the
                    <lb/>same time our petition being written we laid that on the table also, the
                    <lb/>Commissioner called on us to sign his paper. The Emigration party to the
                    <lb/>No 23--came forward and signed it. The Commissioner stating it was
                    <lb/>lawful to sign in the presence of the Council. Our petition was <lb/>signed
                    by 62 at the same time. At that time there was a large <lb/>majority of the
                    Cheifs and nearly all the Warriors on our side. The <lb/>Commissioner then said
                    I now close the Council, but my boods shall be <lb/>open all night and 'till
                    after breakfast tomorrow morning. There <lb/>I will leave the reservation, at
                    the time he dismissed the Council he <lb/>removed the books to a Public House in
                    the vicinity, and some of <lb/>our people who had received large sums of money
                    of the <orgName key="ogden">Augden Co</orgName>
                    <lb/><pb n="69d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_129"/>used great exertions to get many of the Cheifs to go to this place and
                    prevailed <lb/>on some, with money--and others under the influence of ardent
                    spirits was <lb/>prevailed on to sign the pretended treaty. They offered large
                    sums of money <lb/>to many of the Cheifs who refused it, and remain uncorrupted
                    by the <lb/>offer of their bribes. We told those who had signed the treaty that
                    the <lb/>council is now closed and you now think you have sold our lands
                    <lb/>but we are determined to hold our rights. You may sell your <lb/>proportion
                    according to your number. But we shall none of our land. <lb/>But the
                    Commissioner did not go as he said. He stayed two days <lb/>after the Council
                    was closed, and his books were open all that time <lb/>and when the <orgName
                        key="ogden">Augden Co</orgName> used all their influence to weaken our
                    <lb/>party by offering large sums of money to induce them to sign the
                    <lb/>treaty--on the third day in the afternoon the Commissioner left the
                    <lb/>reservation, and went to <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName>, and
                    held a select Council with <lb/>those Indians who had signed the treaty. The
                        <orgName key="ogden">Augden Co</orgName>, knowing <lb/>our Agent had
                    withheld our annuity from us, and that we intended <lb/>to send a delegation to
                        <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName> and supposing we should be
                    <lb/>necessiated to hire money to defray the expences of our delegates <lb/>went
                    forward to all those they thought would be likely to accomo- <lb/>date us, and
                    by their influence prevented our getting any for that <lb/>purpose.</p>
                <p>Brothers, we have no more to say on the foregoing subject </p>
                <p>Brothers, we and our People are well, and our friends residing <lb/>at <placeName
                        key="tunes">Tunesassah</placeName> are also well. Brothers, our hearts are
                    pained <lb/>therefore we remember you, and aim to let you know our distress
                    <lb/>our necessity induces to ask assistance of our friends. <lb/>We have
                    prevailed on <persName key="jrobi2">James Robertson</persName> to go to
                        <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName> for <lb/>us. He will stop and
                    see you on his Journey--in order to be <lb/>advised by you who to apply to at
                        <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName> for assistance <lb/>and we
                    think it is not likely we shall be able to raise money <lb/>enough to defray his
                    expences while there--and would ask <lb/>you to lend him as much as he may need.
                    Our Agent says <lb/>we shall have our annuity in the 6th mo. when we got that we
                    will <lb/>pay you, and will pay you what you think is right for the use of it
                    <lb/>we will hold ourselves accountable for whatever amount you may <lb/>think
                    proper to let <persName key="jrobi2">James Robertson</persName> have for that
                    purpose. We <lb/>are determined to stay where we are, and enjoy our old homes
                    <lb/>we hold the same minds we were of when our friends <persName key="elewi1"
                        >Enoch <lb/>Lewis</persName> and <persName key="jelki1">Joseph
                        Elkinton</persName> visited us last fall. Brothers we beleive <lb/>the love
                    you have felt towards us emenated from the Great Spirit <lb/>and we beg the
                    Great Spirit to preserve you and us, and protect <lb/>us in our rights. There is
                    16 Cheifs on this reservation, two of <lb/>which have joined the emigration
                    party. The <orgName key="tonaw">Tonewanda Indi- <lb/>ans</orgName> are all
                    firmly opposed to selling their land. At <placeName key="buffa"

                    <lb/>reservation there is a majority of the Cheifs in favour of selling but
                    <lb/>the warriors are mostly opposed to it, the same may be said of <orgName

                        <lb/>Dear Friends</salute></opener>
                <p>The paragraph contained in <lb/><del/> the Epistle from your Yearly Meeting
                    <lb/>touching the above subject claimed the es- <lb/>pecial notice of our Yearly
                    Meeting and we <lb/>were by minute directed to correspond with <lb/>you relative
                    thereto.</p>
                <p>You are no doubt already informed <lb/>that in conjunction with the Yearly
                    Meetings of <lb/><orgName key="bym">Baltimore</orgName> and <orgName key="iym"
                        >Indiana</orgName> we have long had <lb/>under our care the civilization and
                    Christian <lb/>Instruction of the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> Tribe
                    of Indians. <lb/>And that while in a progressive state of im- <lb/>provement
                    they were removed from this <lb/>State west of the <geogName key="missi"
                        >Mississippi</geogName>. We have however <lb/>thought it right to follow
                    them to their new <lb/>abode,--have erected buildings--placed a fam- <lb/>ily
                    there, and opened a school. You may not <lb/>be aware that in a school thus
                    circumstanced the <lb/>children have to be learned and boarded and Clothed by
                    <lb/>Friends; thus involving a very heavy expense <lb/>especially in a new
                    Country where provisions are <lb/>high. It is caused of deep humiliation and
                    <lb/>sorrow that our efforts to give the young Natives <lb/>a knowledge of
                    letters and of the truths of <lb/>the gospel as contained in the Holy Scriptures
                    <lb/>have not hitherto been efficient for the want <lb/>of adequate means. The
                    whole of the funds <lb/>originally derived from our brethren in England
                    <lb/>being detained in the hands of Hicksites in <lb/><placeName key="balti"
                        >Baltimore</placeName>. Contributions among ourselves have <lb/>not enabled
                    us to keep a school in the <gap/>
                    <lb/>mentioned all the year; and until this desirable <lb/><pb n="71b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_131"/>object can be
                    attained we cannot expect our <lb/>labours will be successful</p>
                <p>This tribe numbers some upwards of <lb/>Twelve hundred of whom two hundred are
                    <lb/>said to be children. It is very certain that <lb/>with our limited means we
                    cannot occupy <lb/>successfully the field of labour which this <lb/>tribe
                    presents; and while we are engaged <lb/>with them they will suffer no others to
                    come <lb/>in. If therefore you see it right to come <lb/>to our aid in this
                    Christian work it will <lb/>be cordial to our feelings, and when explained
                    <lb/>to the Indians acceptable no doubt to them.</p>
                <p>So far as our knowledge extends the <lb/>Neighbouring Tribes are generally under
                    the care <lb/>of other Religious Societies.</p>
                <p>It will be acceptable to us to <lb/>hear from you at any time on this interesting
                    <lb/>subject.</p>

                    am <lb/>firmly of oppinion that the mistreatment of the whites is the

                    <lb/>informed what money is likely to be raised the present year <lb/>and if the
                    funds will justify it they are desireous to get the <lb/>house raised &amp;
                    inclosed the present year. We are in great need <lb/>of such an institution
                    having I suppose about 12000 children <lb/>within our limits and it being verry
                    difficult to furnish our <lb/>primary schools with suitable teachers &amp; it
                    will be hard to <lb/>remady that dificulty in any other way than by a bording
                    School <lb/>and not only that but for want of such an institution many of
                    friends <lb/>children are sent to county Siminaries and other Schools where
                    <lb/>the example set before them is calculated to lead their minds <lb/>to soar
                    above the Simplisity of the truth as prosessed by us <lb/>But for want of
                    information respecting such institutions some <lb/>seem prejudiced against it
                    apprehending it will only benefit <lb/>the Rich and therefore withhold
                    subscribing tho I have a hope <lb/>as the yearly meeting appointed a committee
                    to solisit sub- <lb/>scriptions in the limits of each quarter who are able to
                    give <lb/>information respecting such a school that much of the preju- <lb/>dice
                    will be removed and the money will be raised <lb/>and the work go on.</p>
                <p>Thou will see by the minutes of the yearly meeting that there <lb/>was no
                    ministering friends from other yearly meeting of it which I think <lb/>was the
                    first that we have held by ourselves. Tho we were not <lb/>without the company
                    of the great head of the church by his holy <lb/>Spirrit under the influence of
                    which we were enabled <lb/>to tranceact the buisiness in much harmony</p>

                <p>Having lately learned that thou art <lb/>one of the <orgName key="oymindian">Ohio

                        key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> tribe of Indians, now <lb/>residing
                    on the South side of <geogName key="winnel">Winnebago Lake</geogName> in Wisc-
                    <lb/>onsin Tery. They have resided in that Tery. for the <lb/>last 16 years, to
                    which place they came from one of the <lb/>central Counties of <placeName

                <p>I do not know what rule of action the Committee <lb/>have adopted, whether their
                    attention is Confined to <lb/>the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawanesse</orgName>
                    &amp; some others formerly in <placeName key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>, or whether
                    <lb/>they would consider themselves at liberty to act for the <lb/>welfare of
                    the Indian wherever they saw an opportu- <lb/>nity to effect any improvement in
                    his conditions, and <lb/>whether he was or not, now accepting the aid of other
                    <lb/>religious Societies. Be this as it may I feel it obli- <lb/>gatory upon me
                    to give thee some account of an interview <lb/>I had with <persName key="jquin2"
                        >Jn. Quinney</persName>, <persName key="aquin1">A. E. Quinney</persName>

                    <del/> We accidentally put up at the same Hostel <lb/>in <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit</placeName> in the early part of this winter. Perceiving at
                    <lb/>suppertime that I was somewhat peculiarly dressed, <persName key="aquin1"
                        >A. E. Quinney</persName>
                    <lb/><pb n="73b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_134"/>shortly after asked me if I was a member of the society of Friends <lb/>and
                    being answered in the affirmiation invited me to spend <lb/>the evening in their
                    room, which invitation I gladly accepted, <lb/>as Indian Character &amp; Indian
                    welfare have long been subjects <lb/>of the liveliest interest to me. The
                        <q>Talk</q> was commenced <lb/> by <persName key="jquin2">Jno.
                        Quinney</persName> with their Characteristic gravity, he said <lb/>that he
                    well remembered the care extended to their Tribe by <lb/>the Society of Friends,
                    when he was young, that it had sent <lb/>amongst them teachers of both sexes who
                    instructed them in <lb/>letters, the men in agriculture &amp; the mechanic arts,
                    and the <lb/>women in the domestic duties of civilized life, that the
                    <lb/>instruction thus afforded had been of inestimable value to <lb/>them, that
                    its effects still existed amongst them, and was exten- <lb/>ding through them to
                    other tribes of Indians, &amp; that the <lb/>Red men felt the most sincere
                    gratitude therefore towards our <lb/>Society. This he expressed in the warmest
                    terms, and conclu- <lb/>ded by desiring me to convey the same to the Society
                    when <lb/>an opportunity offered, and to say to it that the advices and
                    <lb/>instruction of its elder members would now be acceptable.</p>
                <p>That they would be happy to show to it that <del/>its labors had been
                    <lb/>servicable in placing in placing them in their present condi- <lb/>tion
                    which is his own experience is on the rise, &amp; steadily but <lb/>slowly on
                    the advance towards coplete civilization. This they <lb/>seemed anxious should
                    be accellerated.</p>
                <p>I much regret that I cannot give his words verbation: <lb/>but what I have said
                    must be nearly the substance. The <lb/>manner in which it was delivered was to
                    me satisfactory <lb/>evidence that it proceded from the heart.</p>
                <p>After they had concluded what seemed to be their object <lb/>in inviting me into
                    their room, we had much, to me, interesting <lb/>conversation, in which they
                    give many of the particulars of <lb/>their situation &amp; some of the internal
                    regulations of their <lb/>tribe, such as its form of government, Legislative
                    Judicial &amp; <lb/>Executive--which are very simple. They have a <orgName
                        key="presby">Presby- <lb/>terian</orgName> mission amongst them. Those I saw
                    appeared to <lb/>be men of inafficted piety, and the two who spoke our
                    <lb/>Language were very intelligent men. One of them had <lb/>been taught the
                    English language gramatically--&amp; speaks <lb/>it very correctly, though with
                    some hesitation; this he said <lb/>arose from using their own language wholly,
                    amongst themselves; he was <lb/>also so much of a mathemetician as to be able to
                    perform <lb/>plane surverying--which could also be done by 4 others of the
                    <lb/>tribe. Here I think is a field for accomplishing <lb/>much service to the
                    cause of Christianity &amp; Civilization <lb/>and to this wronged and blighted
                    portion of the human race. That it <lb/>properly belongs to Friends at <orgName
                        key="oym">Ohio Yearly Meeting</orgName> is I think evident <lb/>from the
                    fact that it is of more easy access to them than any others. <lb/>The Committee
                    I have no doubt is fully aware of the importance of the objects Com- <lb/>mitted
                    to their charge &amp; also of the ability of Friends of Ohio <lb/>to do all that
                    may be Exquisite in a preuniary way, to aid it, <lb/>so that I need make no
                    other appeal to its Christian benevolence than to <lb/>inform it, as requested,
                    that the way is open to do good. Should any <lb/>members of the Committee wish
                    to visit this tribe the best way would <lb/>be to embark on one of the Steam
                    Boats which leave this place, during the summer, <lb/>every 2 or 3 days, for
                        <placeName key="greeb">Green Bay</placeName>, which place would be reached
                    in 4 or 5 days at <lb/>a passage expence of 15 or 20 doll. (I think 15) &amp;
                    there they would have to traval about <lb/>30 miles over land by a U. States
                    Military Road to reach the <lb/>place of its residence. I should be glad to hear
                    from thee <gap/>

                    <lb/>themselves made important advances in the habits of Morality,

                    recent accounts recieved through <lb/>our friends of Indians respecting the
                    present state of the <lb/>Undertaking, it appears that the Super Intendant has
                    <lb/>raised the past year &amp; taken care of about 200 Dozen <lb/>of wheat, of
                    oats the product of 2 1/2 acres, &amp; put up 8 to 10 tons of <lb/>hay, &amp;
                    has raised on an extent of 6 to 7 acres, Good Corn &amp; <lb/>vegetables
                    sufficient for the use of the family, and that there <lb/>are two horses, four
                    cows, &amp; four young cattle belonging <lb/>to the Establishment. The school
                    was opened 1st of First <lb/>month <date when="1838">1838 </date>&amp; continued
                    for 3 monthes when it was dismiss- <lb/>ed on account if sickness--Average

                <p>Although during <lb/>the prosecution of this very interesting concern
                    difficulties <lb/>have frequently occured to mar the Work from the Disturbed

                    <lb/>to, it has seemed to us that we were best satisfied to propose <lb/>to our

                    Establishment on the <placeName key="kansar">Konsas <lb/>River</placeName>, we
                    thought that an Agency might be placed with <lb/>our friends who may be residing
                    at that place without <lb/>so great expenses, and do more good among the much
                    <lb/>neglected remnants of tribes who are for more exposed <lb/>to the

                <p>WE, the Representatives of the <orgName key="bym">Yearly Meeting of
                        Friends</orgName>, for the <lb/>Western Shore of Maryland, the adjacent
                    parts of Pennsylvania and <lb/>Virginia, and the State of Ohio, being convened
                    in the City of <lb/><placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, on those
                    concerns which relate to our society, feel our <lb/>minds engaged to address
                    thee on behalf of ourselves, and the <lb/>religious society which we
                    represent.</p>
                <p>Permit us to say, that whilst we desire to be preserved from inter- <lb/>meddling
                    with the policy of those governments under which we live, <lb/>we believe it to
                    be our indispensable duty, consistently with that <lb/>Christian obligation,
                    with relation to governments, to <quote type="biblical">lead a quiet <lb/>and
                        peaceable life under them, in all Godliness and honesty.</quote></p>
                <p>We feel gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe, in that <lb/>he hath
                    influenced the councils of the general government of our <lb/>country, to decide
                    upon several important subjects, agreeably to the <lb/>principles of eternal
                    justice and right.</p>
                <p>Amongst the most prominent of those acts which claim our ap- <lb/>probation, we
                    are induced to notice thy efforts to preserve our coun- <lb/>try from the
                    ravages and calamities of war, by cultivating a dispo- <lb/>sition, and pursuing
                    a conduct, marked with conciliation and friend- <lb/>ship toward all those
                    nations with whom we have intercourse; <lb/>thereby avoiding those grounds of
                    dissention, which are often the <lb/>sources from whence this desolating scourge
                    has its origin, to the <lb/>reproach of Christianity. For, as we are firmly
                    persuaded of its <lb/>obligation as a righteous principle, so it is our fervent
                    desire, in re- <lb/>gard to all men, that even the smallest germ of enmity may
                    be era- <lb/>dicated. And our ardent prayer to the Father of the Universe is,
                    <lb/>that, through the overruling order of his providence, the hearts and
                    <lb/>understanding of his erring and contending creatures may be illu-
                    <lb/>minated, so to behold the excellency of brotherly affection, as to be-
                    <lb/>come willing to admit the spirit of reconciliation.</p>
                <p>We are also bound to acknowledge those philanthropic exertions, <lb/>which have
                    been used to ameliorate the condition of the Indian na- <lb/>tives, by
                    introducing among them a knowledge of agriculture, and <lb/>some of the mechanic
                    arts. We sincerely congratulate thee on <lb/>their progress in cilvilization,
                    and the very encouraging prospect, <lb/>abundantly evinced, that this truly
                    benevolent and laudable under- <lb/>taking will ultimately be crowned with the
                    desired success--an un- <lb/>dertaking which, whilst it increasingly obviates
                    the wretchedness <lb/>of their former condition, converts them from dangerous
                    neigh- <lb/>bours to valuable friends.</p>
                <p>But there remains a subject inexpressibly dear to our hearts, <lb/>which was
                    particularly interesting to our feelings. We rejoice in <lb/>the prospect of a
                    termination to the wrongs of Africa, and that a <lb/>traffic, heretofore
                    legalized in a district of our country, in its nature <lb/>abhorrent to every
                    just and tender sentiment, and reproachful to <lb/>humanity, to say nothing of
                    Christian principles, is inderdicted by <lb/>our government.--For the exertion
                    of thy influence, united with <lb/>the National Legislature (may we not say.) to
                    relieve our country, <lb/>from the complicated evils attendant upon this cruel
                    and inhuman <lb/>trade, we are engaged, through this medium, to testify our
                    warmest <lb/>approbation.</p>
                <p>And may the future councils of our country yield to the influence <lb/>of Him,
                    who is called <quote type="biblical">Wonderful Counsellor, The Mighty God, <lb/>The
                        Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace;</quote> so that the <lb/>exercise
                    of additional acts of justice and mercy, towards this greatly <lb/>oppressed
                    part of the human family, may utterly remove the cries <lb/>of oppression from
                    this highly-favored land.</p>
                <closer><salute>With sentiments of respect due from us to those who, in the
                        <lb/>ordering of Divine providence are set over us, we are thy

                <opener>TO THE FOREGOING ADDRESS, <lb/>THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
                    <lb/>RETURNED THE FOLLOWING ANSWER.</opener>
                <p>I thank you for the address you have kindly presented me, on <lb/>behalf of that
                    portion of the Society of Friends of which you are the <lb/>Representatives: and
                    I learn with satisfaction their approbation of <lb/>the principles which have
                    influenced the councils of the general <lb/>government, in their decisions on
                    several important subjects confided <lb/>to them.</p>
                <p>The desire to preserve our country form the calamities and rava- <lb/>ges of war,
                    by cultivating a disposition, and pursuing a conduct, <lb/>conciliatory and
                    friendly to all nations, has been sincerely enter- <lb/>tained and faithfully
                    followed. It was dictated by the principles of <lb/>humanity, the precepts of
                    the Gospel, and the general wish of our <lb/>country; and it was not to be
                    doubted, that the Society of Friends, <lb/>with whom it is a religious
                    principle, would sanction it by their <lb/>support.</p>
                <p>The same philanthropic motives have directed the public endea- <lb/>vours to
                    ameliorate the condition of the Indian natives, by introduc- <lb/>ing among them
                    a knowledge of agriculture and some of the me- <lb/>chanic arts, by encouraging
                    them to resort to these as more certain, <lb/>and less laborious resources for
                    subsistence, than the chase, and by <lb/>withholding from them the pernicious
                    supplies of ardent spirits. <lb/>They are our brethren, our neighbours; they may
                    be valuable <lb/>friends, of troublesome enemies. Both duty and interest then
                    en- <lb/>join, that we should extend to them the blessings of civilized life,
                    <lb/>and prepare their minds for becoming useful members of the Ame- <lb/>rican
                    family. In this important work, I owe to your Society an <lb/>acknowledgment
                    that we have felt the benefits of their zealous co- <lb/>operation, and approved
                    its judicious direction towards producing <lb/>among those people habits of
                    industry, comfortable subsistence, and <lb/>civilized usages, as preparatory to
                    religious instruction, and the cul- <lb/>tivation of letters.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the circumstances which influenced our <lb/>forefathers to
                    permit the introduction of personal bondage into any <lb/>part of these States,
                    and to participate in the wrongs committed on <lb/>an unoffending quarter of the
                    globe, we may rejoice that such cir- <lb/>cumstances, and such a sense of them,
                    exist no longer. It is hon- <lb/>ourable to the nation at large, that their
                    Legislature availed them- <lb/>selves, at the first practicable moment, for
                    arresting the progress of <lb/>this great moral and political error: and i
                    sincerely pray with you, <lb/>my friends, that all the members of the human
                    family, may, in the <lb/>time prescribed by the Father of us all, find
                    themselves securely es- <lb/>tablished in the enjoyments of life, liberty and
                    happiness. </p>

                    this <lb/>and <del/>the <orgName key="neym">New England Yearly

                    behalf of the Com- <lb/>mittee of our Yearly Meeting on this subject, and to
                    state <lb/>our entire approbation of the names of these Friends; <lb/>and a hope
                    was feelingly expressed, that they might see <lb/>it right before long, to set
                    out on this interesting service, <lb/>and to add, that the expenses would
                    cheerfully be paid <lb/>on our part, out of the money jointly raised for this
                    purpose, by <lb/>the two Yearly Meetings.</p>
                <p>If your Committee could see it right to <lb/>signify, with us, our full
                    approbation with the prospect of these <lb/>Friends, and for thee, on behalf of
                    your Committee, to <lb/>write to them <del/>, to encourage them with our sym-
                    <lb/>pathy and unity in this work of justice and love, and to <lb/><pb n="87b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_150"/>express to
                    them our strong desire for their help and en- <lb/>couragement, <del/>it might
                    enable <lb/>them to move in a labor, in which, from its probable length toil
                    <lb/>and exposure, they might possible be fearful and re- <lb/><del/>luctant to

                    Head of the Church.</p>
                <p>If these Friends should see it right to give themselves <lb/>up to the service it
                    does appear to us best that they <lb/>should be prepared to pay the Indians in

                    religious engagements, governments, <lb/>and policies, and to encourage them to
                    pursue agricul- <lb/>ture and mechanical employments, and to recom- <lb/>mend
                    such measures as would promote there and <lb/>other peaceful objects, and to
                    discouregement of a war <lb/>Spirit and jealousies amongst tribes; in short, to
                    <gap/> and <lb/>particular notes as far as would be practiceable
                    <lb/><del/><lb/>so that these documents might be <lb/>laid before our respective
                    Committees for publication, <lb/>or not; as might be thought advisable.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see, that such a statement would <lb/>be exceedingly interesting to
                    Friends, both in our own <lb/>land, and to our dear brethren on the other side
                    of the <lb/>Atlantic, as will as to the public generally; and further <lb/>move,
                    it would be casting in our mite towards laying <lb/>off an immeasureable debt
                    which the white people owe <lb/>to the aborigenies of this land, for the great
                    injustice <lb/>and oppression of which they have been so long and so

                    <lb/>and <orgName key="neym">New England</orgName> Yearly Meetings--and the
                    result of this <lb/>correspondence is that we find the minds of our friends
                    <lb/>are turned to this important service. At a meeting <lb/>of our Committee
                    held on the 12th inst (at which <persName key="jlang2">John D.
                        <lb/>Lang</persName> was present) there was a very full expression of unity
                    <lb/>with our friends in this engagement and they were <lb/>incouraged to pursue
                    it whenever they should <gap/>
                    <lb/>that the time had come for them to enter upon it.</p>
                <p>Should the prospect continue to rest upon their minds <lb/>and they to receive
                    the unity of their friends therein, it <lb/>is not probable they will think it
                    best to engage in it before <lb/>another season. In the mean time any
                    information <lb/>that you may be able to obtain, as to the best time of <lb/>the
                    year for visiting the Indians--the most suitable <lb/>mode of travelling this
                    their country, and any other <lb/>information that might be useful to friends
                    thus <lb/>engaged would be very acceptable to them.</p>

                    <lb/>doing some good to this poor degraded tribe of Indians. As miserable
                    <lb/>and degraded as any of the Tribes west of the <geogName key="missi"
                        >Mississippi River</geogName>. This <lb/>Tribe numbers about 2200 in all and
                    fast waisting away through <lb/>the destructive influence of the whites, many of
                    whom are selling <lb/>them whiskey and in every other possible way cheating them
                    out of all <lb/>their Annuities of money, Blankets Guns, &amp;c. So that in a
                    very short <lb/>time after their Annuities are made the poor Indians have
                    nothing <lb/>to show but poverty and retchedness. We were informed by <persName
                        key="dlawr1">D. Lawrey</persName>
                    <lb/>the Agent that in a little more than one Year thirty nine persons Indians
                    had been <lb/>killed in their drunken revels, that had come to his knowledge.
                    And he <lb/>had not much doubt, but that a number more might have been killed
                    <lb/>which he did not know of </p>

                <p><pb n="91c" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_157"/>We were kindly received and entertained by the Sub. Agent during our <lb/>Stay at
                    the Acengy, And every facility afforded for conversing with the <lb/>Indians
                    through his son who is an Interpreter, that their circumstances <lb/>would admit
                    of (it being a very busy time with them while we were there <lb/>The Indians
                    were coming in from all parts of the Indian country to receive <lb/>their
                    Annuity in money which was to be paid out to the head of every family
                    <lb/>immediately after our leaving the place, I think we were informed that
                    <lb/>about twenty eight thousand dollars was to be paid them at this time in
                    <lb/>money and that not a dollar of it would remain in the hands of the poor
                    <lb/>Indians in one week after the payment was completed, or at most but a
                    <lb/>very small part of it The Whiskey dollars, and Indian traders are generally
                    <lb/>prowling about the Indians, ready to seize upon the first opportunity
                    <lb/>of getting hold of the money or any other thing of value that the Indians
                    <lb/>may have, and this too for a little whiskey or some other trifling gewgaw
                    <lb/>of no real value to the Indians. Unless some thing is done to better the
                    condition <lb/>of this tribe and to prevent the introduction of whiskey amongst
                    them <lb/>they must soon all be waisted and Gone. We had two talks with a
                    <lb/>number of their chiefs and about 30 of their principle men. <lb/>They
                    listened very patiently to what we had to say amongst them <lb/>manifested,
                    their satisfaction that we had come so far to pay them a <lb/>visit. They
                    apeared sensible of the injury that whiskey was doing them <lb/>and wished that
                    it were otherwise, said before they were acquainted with <lb/>white men they
                    lived comfortable and happey, but as son as white <lb/>men came amongst them
                    they began to be sickly and diseased. Their <lb/>young men and women died off,
                    whereas before that time none of their <lb/>young men died, but on the contrary
                    all their people lived to be white <lb/>headed, and that they had no sickness
                    among them, but all died of old age <lb/>One of the Chiefs told us in his talk
                    to us that he supposed that the <lb/>white men must have got the Fire Water from
                    the bad Spirit for he was <lb/>very certain that it never came from the Good
                    Spirit. And that they should <lb/>be glad of it could be kept away from them,
                    but so long as it was <lb/>within their reach they could not refrain from
                    drinking it and they <lb/>could not keep their young men from drinking and
                    Getting drunk <lb/>and when they were drunk they could not tell what they did
                    but <lb/>that they became unmanageable and killed one another. He said that
                    <lb/>their great Father the president had promised them that he would keep
                    <lb/>the whiskey dealers away from them but he had not done as he promised
                    <lb/>and they supposed he had so much great business to attend to that <lb/>he
                    could not find time to attend to there small concerns, and now <lb/>it was to
                    late to do them any good. We told them that we did not <lb/>think it was told
                    and that we wold try to let there Great Father <lb/>know their situation and ask
                    him to extend some relief to them, we also <lb/>told them that they had a great
                    many friends away to the east who <lb/>loved the red man and who were trying to
                    help them, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>After spending about three days at this place and collecting what
                    <lb/>information are could from the Indians, visiting them at their lodges
                    <lb/>and collecting from the Agent and other white residents at the place (of
                    <lb/>whom there are about twenty) all the knowledge of the manners and customs
                    <lb/>of the Indians which they were able to give in so Short a time as will as
                    thru <lb/>suggestions of the most judicious method to be adapted for their

                    of 100 miles across the prairie <lb/>We were well satisfied in taking this

                    of 2200 or <lb/>2800 men women and children. Their appearance was much better
                    than <lb/>that of the <orgName key="winne">Winnebagas</orgName>. And yet the

                <p>The Governor treated us very kindly, spoke freely and feelingly <lb/>of their

                            to believe has been, or is <lb/>about being, introduced into the Indian
                            country, which is not intended as a part of the military supplies
                            <lb/>authorized by this Department, and, if found, to destroy it; and to
                            seize upon the property of the per- <lb/>son guilty of the offence, with
                            which the same may be found, and deliver it over to the proper officer,
                            to <lb/>be proceeded against by libel in the proper court; such property
                            being liable to forfeiture, one half to the <lb/>use of the informer,
                            and the other to that of the <orgName key="usag">United
                            States</orgName>. It is also the duty of any person, in any <lb/>way in
                            the employment of the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>--and the
                            same may be done by any Indian--to destroy any <lb/>spirituous liquor or

                        <item>3d. If the person guilty of introducing, or of attempting to
                            introduce, spirituous liquor or wine into <lb/>the Indian country, be a
                            trader, it is the duty of the proper superintendent, agent or sub-agent,
                            immediately <lb/>to revoke his license and to put his bond in
                            suit.</item>
                        <item>4th. To destroy any distillery in the Indian country for the
                            manufacture of ardent spirits, and to <lb/>cause to be promptly
                            prosecuted any person or persons who may erect or carry on such
                            distillery, in <lb/>order to recover the fine of one thousand dollars
                            prescribed for such offence.</item>

                    </list></p>
                <p>It is also provided that in all prosecutions for the offences mentioned in the
                    first of the foregoing heads, <lb/>Indians shall be competent witnesses.</p>
                <p>All military officers in the Indian country, and the superintendents, agents, and
                    sub-agents of the <lb/>Indian Department, are required and enjoined to be
                    vigilant and active in the execution of the duties <lb/>imposed upon them by
                    these laws, which are appended hereto for their more particular information as
                    to <lb/>the nature and extent of their respective duties; and it is expected
                    that all other persons in the employ- <lb/>ment of the <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName>, or who are licensed or permitted to be in the Indian
                    country, will, on every <lb/>occasion, aid those officers and agents in the most
                    effectual manner in their power.</p>
                <p>Any ommission on the part of the officers of, and persons employed in the Indian
                    Department, particu- <lb/>larly, or on the part of those licensed or permitted
                    to be in the Indian country, to do all that can justly <lb/>and fairly be done
                    to put an end to the infamous traffic with the Indians, in or through
                    intoxicating liquors, <lb/>will be regarded as good cause for their removal in
                    the one case, or in the other for the revocation of their <lb/>licences or
                    permits.</p>
                <p>Now that Indians are made competent witnesses in our courts, for the purpose of
                    further enabling <lb/>the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> to destroy an
                    evil which has been so destructive of their best interests and happiness, it
                    <lb/>is expected that the chiefs and others, who desire welfare and prosperity
                    of their people, will co- <lb/>operate with the agents of the <orgName
                        key="usag">Government</orgName> in arresting this great source of mischief
                    to the Indian race. <lb/>Those who fail to do so by every proper means in their
                    power cannot be regarded as desiring or caring <lb/>for either.</p>
                <p>By the 3d section of the act of the 3d ultimo, it is provided that <q>No
                        annuities, or moneys, or goods, <lb/>shall be paid or distributed to the
                        Indians while they are under the influence of any description of in-
                        <lb/>toxicating liquor; nor while there are good and sufficient reasons for
                        the officers or agents, whose duty <lb/>it may be to make such payments or
                        distribution, for believing that there is any species of intoxicating
                        <lb/>liquor within convenient reach of the Indians; nor until the chiefs and
                        head men of the tribe shall <lb/>have pledged themselves to use all their
                        influence, and to make all proper exertions, to prevent the in-
                        <lb/>troduction and sale of such liquor in their country.</q></p>

                    <lb/>dren read examined <del/>in Arithmetic <lb/>and Geography and saw their
                    writing and <lb/>composition, distributed tracts amongst them <lb/>and conversed
                    with them on the opperations <lb/>of the two Spirits which works on the mind
                    <lb/>and produces good or bad results; they <lb/>listened with attention and
                    appeared more <lb/>than usually thoughtful. I also called <lb/>divers meetings
                    with both Pagan an Christian <lb/>parties, conversed with them on their moral
                    <lb/>and religious obligations towards each other <lb/>and towards God their
                    Father &amp; Preserver <lb/>and God the son as their savious and Redeemer
                    <lb/>and God the Holy Ghost as their visitor, to <lb/>reprove, instruct, and
                    comfort them; and <lb/>I have reason to believe that there are many <lb/>honest
                    and upright intentions amongst the <lb/>pagans, but I cannot help lamenting over
                    <lb/>their strong prejudices against an acquaintan- <lb/>ce with the content of
                    the bible. Many of <lb/>both parties expressed their unity with me <lb/>and what
                    I had said to them and promised <lb/>to think about it <del/> in my absence,
                    <lb/>said they were much pleased to hear about <lb/>their red brothers living in
                    the far west, <lb/>and about the good schools they had for <lb/>the education of
                    their children; hoped that</p>

                <p>the Missionaries would not grow tired <lb/>for <q>Indian children not fast to
                        learn and <lb/>sometimes no ear to hear good words, sometimes <lb/>no eye to
                        see the good it will be to him to <lb/>learn to talk, read, write and work
                        like <lb/>white man</q>; they were very glad we <lb/>learned them to work,
                    as well as read for <lb/>these <q>Indian children learned to live as well
                        <lb/>as think</q>; many said my visit had <lb/>reminded them of many years
                    past, when <lb/>Friends labored among them, and wished <lb/>I would talk with
                    the <orgName key="nym">Friends of New York</orgName>
                    <lb/>an <orgName key="pym">Philadelphia</orgName>, to see if they could not
                    <lb/>help them in establishing a manual <lb/>labor boarding school, for it was
                    just <lb/>what they needed, and these <q>Indian <lb/>would progress faster
                        <del/> in the path of <lb/>civilization</q>, and with tears in their
                    <lb/>eyes, expressed a hope that they should hear <lb/>from me again.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="seneca">Senecas</orgName> seemed quite disposed <lb/>to adopt

                    carrying out <lb/>the laws and regulations for the general good <lb/>of the
                    nation. On each reservation I found <lb/>some industrious and enterprising men,
                    <lb/>who had houses and lands to rent, and <lb/>had also comfortable homes for
                    their own <lb/>families; and in this way the white men <lb/>mingle among them,
                    sometimes to their adva- <lb/>ntage; bust mostly to their disadvantage; <lb/>it
                    is in this channel that dealers in dry-goods </p>

                <p>and spirituous liquors creep in among them <lb/>and do them much injury by their
                    example <lb/>and precept. The men have generally <lb/>adopted the American style
                    of dress, and <lb/>speak and understand our language, tho <lb/>but little
                    acquaited with books.</p>
                <p>The education of the girls has been much <lb/>neglected, which accounts for their
                    shyness <lb/>and adherence to their ancient customs, <lb/>both in style of
                    dress, language &amp;c. yet I found <lb/>some few in each reservation, having
                    had the <lb/>advantages of a missionary education, <lb/>They could read, and
                    were cleanly in their persons <lb/>and in their houses; but where the women
                    <lb/>have confined their attention to basket making <lb/>and fancy bead work,
                    they were very poor <lb/>housekeepers and enjoyed fewer conveniences <lb/>and
                    comforts at home.</p>
                <p>The schools under the control of the <orgName key="bapt">Baptists</orgName>

                    <lb/>school houses, and appropriated a stipulated sum for <lb/>Teachers
                    saleries. In every nation, I thought <lb/>I could discover the kind of labor
                    that had <lb/>been principally bestowed upon them, <lb/>wether religious, moral
                    or pagan.</p>
                <p>The general disposition of their minds as well as <lb/>things around them, was a

                <p>societies have been formed in most of the <lb/>nations; but still there are many
                    very <lb/>intemerate ones of both sexes, and thus it will <lb/>be until grace

                <p>I pray the Father of all good that He may send <lb/>more Christian laborers among
                    them, who <lb/>shall feel bound to teach them Christian <lb/>Principles and

                <p>Having been permitted through the <lb/>goodness and merciful preservation of our
                    Great Care <lb/>Taken to accomplish our journey among the Indians, <lb/>we would
                    now inform that we have visited about <lb/>twenty Tribes and remnants of Tribes
                    of those located on <lb/>the western frontier of the United States, and have
                    taken <lb/>the following notes and observations respecting them.</p>
                <p>At the close of <orgName key="neym">New England Yearly Meeting</orgName>
                    <lb/>of Friends in <date when="1842">1842</date>, having consulted with several
                    mem- <lb/>bers of the Committee on Indian affairs; both of <orgName key="neym"
                        >New <lb/>England</orgName> and <orgName key="nym">New York</orgName> Yearly
                    Meetings, and they having <lb/>expressed thier concurrence in our prospect of
                    visiting <placeName key="wash">Wash- <lb/>ington</placeName> at that time in
                    order to procure some documents from <lb/>the Indian department. We proceeded
                    directly there and <lb/>had an introduction with the Commissioner on Indian
                    affairs. <lb/>Upon being made acquainted with our business he re- <lb/>ceived us
                    kindly, and freely offered to furnish us with <lb/>such letters and documents
                    signed by the Secretary of <lb/>War and himself as might be useful in
                    facilitating our <lb/>contemplated visit--while at <placeName key="wash"
                        >Washington</placeName> we pro- <lb/>cured some public documents and Reports
                    respecting the <lb/>Indians, and returned pretty directly to <placeName
                        key="nycit">New York</placeName>; there <lb/>we made some arrangements with
                    the Committee preparatory <lb/>to our journey, and then returned to our
                    homes.</p>
                <p>Having made the needful proparations we took <lb/>leave of our dear families and
                    friends the latter part of <lb/>the <date when="1842-08">eighth month
                        1842</date>--on our way we called on <lb/>some of the Indian Committee in
                        <placeName key="provi">Providence</placeName>, and then <lb/>proceeded to
                        <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, where having completed our
                    <lb/>arrangements for the journey we took leave of the Com- <lb/>mittee there,
                    and many other dear friends. From <placeName key="nycit">New
                        <lb/>York</placeName> we pursued our way to <orgName key="oym">Ohio Yearly
                        Meeting</orgName> through <lb/><placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>,
                    calling at the Indian department--we attended <lb/>the several sittings of the
                    Yearly Meeting, and two sittings of <lb/>the Committee on the concern for the
                    Indians; heard the Report <lb/>of their Committee respecting the condition of
                    the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName>
                    <lb/>School, and made such inquiries as seemed proper respecting <lb/>the best
                    mode of getting to the <geogName key="missi">Mississipi River</geogName>: and
                    <lb/><pb n="113b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_191"/>having a special desire to commence our visit as far north <lb/>as the
                        <orgName key="winne">Winebago Tribe</orgName> of Indians; fearing that the
                    boats <lb/>would be impeded on account of the low stage of water in <lb/>the
                        <placeName key="ohior">Ohio river</placeName>, it seemed most advisable to
                    take the north- <lb/>ern route--for accordingly travelled by land to <placeName
                        key="cleve">Cleaveland</placeName>, <lb/>thence by Steam Boat to <placeName
                        key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, and by land across the <lb/>State of
                        <placeName key="michi1">Michigan</placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName
                        key="stjos">St. Josephs River</placeName>, <lb/>here we took Steam Boat over
                        <placeName key="lakem">Lake Michigan</placeName> Sixty <lb/>miles to
                        <placeName key="chica">Chicago</placeName>; after waiting one day in this
                    place <lb/>we departed by Stage for <placeName key="gali">Galina</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="dubuq">Dubuque</placeName>, cross- <lb/>ing the State of
                        <placeName key="illinois">Illinois</placeName> a distance of one hundred
                    <lb/>and eighty miles. We reached the latter place <lb/>in safety, though much
                    fatigued with our journey, the <lb/>roads being dry and dusty, and the weather
                    exceedingly <lb/>warm: we arrived in <placeName key="dubuq">Dubuque</placeName>
                    early on first day morning, <lb/>and the following evening procured a conveyance
                    to the <lb/><orgName key="winne">Winebago</orgName> Indians. On second day
                    morning we left <lb/>in a waggon; travelling in a north westerly direction
                    <lb/>about one hundred miles across a beautiful prairie <lb/>country to
                        <placeName key="turkr">Turkey River</placeName>--on third day afternoon
                    <lb/>while stopping for some refreshment about twenty <lb/>five miles distant
                    from the Indian villages, then came <lb/>to the house five or six Indians in a
                    state of intoxica- <lb/>tion (having procured their whiskey at a shop near
                    <lb/>by); they were very noisy, calling for whiskey &amp;c. <lb/>and greatly
                    annoying those peaceable settlers.</p>
                <p>The next morning after leaving for the agency <lb/>we fell in with a number of
                    companies most of <lb/>whom were intoxicated; some of them carrying whiskey
                    <lb/>on thier ponies to their villages.</p>
                <p>On fourth day of the week and <date when="1842-09-29">29th of ninth <lb/>month
                        1842</date>, we reached the mission for the <orgName key="winne"
                        >Winnebego</orgName>
                    <lb/>Tribe of Indians, and took lodging with the Sub. Ag- <lb/>ent <persName
                        key="dlawr1">David Lowry</persName>; where we were kindly entertained
                    <lb/>by him and his family, and every facility in their pow- <lb/>er afforeded
                    us for conferring with the Indians; as <lb/>well as a readiness to furnish such
                    information as <lb/>was desired.</p>
                <p><orgName key="winne">Winnebago</orgName>. Tribe of Indians.</p>
                <p>This Tribe is located north west from <placeName key="iowa">Iowa
                        Territory</placeName>, and <lb/>west of <placeName key="prair">Prairie du
                        Cheine</placeName>, on lands called the neutral <lb/>ground. They are
                    located on different parts of <lb/>this land in settlements called
                    villages; thier principal one <lb/>called the School Band is near the sub Agency
                    of <persName key="dlawr1">David Lowry</persName>
                    <lb/>on <placeName key="turkr">Turkey River</placeName>, and about one hundred
                    miles north west from <lb/><placeName key="dubuq">Dubuque</placeName>, and
                    within four or five miles of <placeName key="fatki">Fort
                    Atkinson</placeName>.</p>
                <p>They number all together about Two Thousand--these <lb/>Indians live in rude
                    lodges or Wigwams as they are sometimes <lb/>called, built in the usual indian
                    style, by forcing forked sticks <lb/>into the ground for posts, into the forks
                    of which they lay <lb/>poles for plates and ribs, preparatory to covering them
                    with <lb/>oak bark: the sides are either made of bark--mats made <lb/>of
                    flags--or skins, fastened to the plates and extending to <lb/>the ground. These
                    wigwams are from ten to twenty <lb/>five feet in length, and about ten feet
                    wide--the inside <lb/>of the building is fitted up with a sort of frame work
                    <lb/>on each side, made of poles two feet high and about <lb/>three feet wide;
                    intended for a sort of bedstead, on which <lb/>they fasten skins or mats, where
                    they lounge and <lb/>sleep--leaving a space through the centre--four feet
                    <lb/>wide--at cash and there is an apperture or door. <lb/>The fire is built in
                    the centre, the smoke escaping <lb/>through a hole in the top.</p>
                <p>There are not unfrequently as many as three or <lb/>four families amounting to
                    twenty persons or more, occu- <lb/>pying one of these miserable hovels--when
                    about their <lb/>homes they live principally upon soups made of wild <lb/>fowl
                    and venison, turnips and potatoes: they also eat <lb/>an abundance of boiled
                    corn;--some corn bread is used, <lb/>and a very little wheat flour;--There is no
                    regular <lb/>order as to the time or manner of taking their meals; <lb/>some are
                    seen eating their soup outside the wig- <lb/>wam. Some are eating while sitting
                    on thier beds, <lb/>while others are engaged in different pursuits: <lb/>and
                    should any person of another family happen <lb/>to come into the lodge when he
                    neede food, he <lb/>would freely partake without invitation as he <lb/>would of
                    his own.</p>
                <p>The dress of the men consits mainly of <lb/>blankets; all of them wear the waist
                    cloth, some <lb/>wear moccasins and leggings; and a few wear a <lb/>calico frock
                    or skirt--the head is more generally <lb/>uncovered, a few however use a
                    turban.</p>
                <p>The dress of the women consists of a broad <lb/>cloth skirt and blanket--some of
                    them wear moccasins and leggings, <lb/><pb n="113d" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_192"/>the head is entirely uncovered,
                    except that the blanket is <lb/>sometimes thrown over it for a coming, but they
                    use no <lb/>other. The dress of the large children is similar to that <lb/>of
                    the grown persons of the same sex; most of the small chil- <lb/>dren go naked
                    during the warm season:--those that attend <lb/>school are clothed similarly to
                    the white children on the <lb/>frontier settlements.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the men and women <lb/>wear ornaments, such as wampum beads,
                    bells and jewelry; <lb/>most of the men paint thier faces on special occasions:
                    <lb/>some part of the face is painted red, and some black.</p>
                <p>The principal employment of the men consists in <lb/>hunting at certain seasons
                    of the year, and when they <lb/>are not thus engaged they do but very little
                    labour of <lb/>any kind: it being considered disgraceful both by men and
                    <lb/>women for the man to be seen at work. Much of <lb/>thier time is spent in
                    riding (of which they are exceedingly <lb/>fond): they likewise spend some time
                    in ball playing <lb/>and other sports, and a considerable time is spent in
                    <lb/>lounging about in idleness.</p>
                <p>The women are generally industrious, per- <lb/>forming the greater part of the
                    manual labour, both in <lb/>the camp and on the land: they look very dejected,
                    and <lb/>appear more like slaves than otherwise--many of the <lb/>women receivd
                    very severe treatment from the men; some <lb/>of them are lame from the rough
                    treatment of the men in <lb/>their drunken revels.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="winne">Winnebagoes</orgName> have but one school, and that
                    <lb/>is supported by the <orgName key="usag">General Government</orgName>, and
                    is under the <lb/>immediate superintendence of the sub agent.</p>
                <p>There have been the past year about ninety children <lb/>at the school, some of
                    whom have made pretty good profi- <lb/>ciency in learning: it was vacant while
                    we were there. <lb/>The Teachers say that they have much difficulty in getting
                    <lb/>the children to attend constantly, and not unfrequently <lb/>the parents
                    have to be bribed to let them go: and oftentimes <lb/>a compliance with the
                    wishes of the teachers to have the <lb/>children attend regularly, is induced
                    only by a state of the <lb/>most abject suffering on the part of both parents
                    and chil- <lb/>dren. Sometimes the parents will consent to let thier chil-
                    <lb/>dren attend school on receiving thin rations of bread and <lb/>meat to
                    carry home to the family; instead of boarding at the <lb/>house provided for
                    their accommodation.</p>

                <p>The school may be considered as rather an interesting Insititu- <lb/>tion, and
                    from what we could gather from the teacers the <lb/>children were as ready to
                    take learning as the whites: they <lb/>are taught in the english language
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>This Tribe is governed by chiefs who sometimes <lb/>hold their office
                    heriditarily--sometimes by a choice of the <lb/>people--and sometimes they are
                    appointed by the agents <lb/>of the <orgName key="usag">General
                        Government</orgName>.</p>
                <p>They have some vague notions of the Deity or Great <lb/>Spirit as He is more
                    generally called by them--they also <lb/>believe in a state of future rewards
                    and punishments, and <lb/>talk about a bad Spirit--very few, if any, have
                    embraced <lb/>christianity.</p>
                <p>The annuity paid to this Tribe is very large, <lb/>amounting to nearly Ninety
                    Thousand Dollars; in money, <lb/>goods, and appropriations for different
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>Previously to their receiving their annuity, the sub agent <lb/>collects the
                    whole Tribe, and pays over to the head of each <lb/>family the amount due
                    them--notwithstanding the large <lb/>sum which they receive, they are still in a
                    most deplor- <lb/>able and suffering condition and fast wasting away.</p>
                <p>Much of their misery may be traced to the treatment of <lb/>the white people
                    towards them.</p>
                <p>But leaving the past and looking only at the present <lb/>conduct of the white
                    man; it is evident that unless something <lb/>more effectual is done to break up
                    the corrupt and iniquitous <lb/>trafic in whiskey; as well as the fraudulent
                    trade carried on <lb/>amongst the Indians by those persons licensed by the
                        <orgName key="usag">Govern- <lb/>ment</orgName>, the <orgName key="winne"
                        >Winnebagos</orgName> will in a few years be numbered <lb/>with the Tribes
                    that are not.</p>
                <p>We were credibly informed, that in difiance of the <lb/>present rigid
                    laws,immediately after the payment of <lb/><date when="1841">1841</date>, there
                    was sold to this Tribe Two hundred barrels <lb/>of whiskey: and at the time of
                    our being there in <date when="1842">1842</date>, the <lb/>sellers thereof had
                    increased in number one third.</p>
                <p>These whiskey dealers and licensed traders find a <lb/>Strong inducement to
                    follow up the poor Indian, from the <lb/>fact of his receiving so large a
                    payment at one time--the <lb/>indian as a general thing is improvident to the
                    last <lb/>degree; and but poorly calculated to keep any amount <lb/>of surplus
                    property: so that within four or five days the <lb/>whiskey seller, residing on
                    the frontier, and the licensed <lb/>trader who is permitted to vend his goods
                    amongst them <lb/><pb n="113f" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_193"/>get nearly all the money.</p>
                <p>These licensed traders are numerous, and generally plant <lb/>themselves at the
                    time the money is paid over in the im- <lb/>mediate vicinity of the place where
                    the payment is <lb/>made: they sell the Indians the most trifling and
                    <lb/>worthless articles for an enormous profit: he is temp- <lb/>ted oftentimes
                    to buy these articles from their gaudy ap- <lb/>pearance--after he has parted
                    with his last dollar <lb/>in money to the whiskey seller of licensed trader in
                    <lb/>payment of old debts for whiskey or some of the above <lb/>mentioned
                    articles (and they are always largely indebted <lb/>to these dealers) he then
                    takes the articles he has purchased <lb/>of the licensed trader to the whiskey
                    shop and sells them <lb/>for a much less price than he gave, and takes his pay
                    <lb/>in whiskey at ten or even twenty times its actual cost <lb/>to the seller.
                    It is no uncommon thing for an Indian <lb/>after he had parted with all his
                    money and many other <lb/>necessary articles; to barter away his gun, horse, and
                    even <lb/>his blanket of a few bottles of whiskey--we were <lb/>credibly
                    informed that these whiskey shops not unfre- <lb/>quently have large piles of
                    blankets, and large stacks <lb/>of guns that have been taken from these poor
                    natives <lb/>for a little whiskey.</p>
                <p>Thus we see that the policy of the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>,
                    <lb/>and the benevolent efforts of those who are honestly <lb/>labouring amongst
                    them for their good are entirely defea- <lb/>ted by the avarice and wickedness
                    of these lawless men.</p>
                <p>On sixth day of the week and first of tenth <lb/>month, agreeable to previous
                    arrangement, we met <lb/>about thirty of thier chiefs and principal men in
                    Council <lb/>at the Agents house. Our object in calling them <lb/>together was
                    explained to them by <persName key="dlawr1">David Lowry</persName> the <lb/>sub
                    agent, and then our Certificates from our friends, <lb/>the Letters and Tack
                    from the Secretary of War, address- <lb/>ed to them--we then felt constrained to
                    make a few <lb/>remarks and extend such advice as seemed proper. <lb/>After
                    which, <persName key="lhill1">Little Hill</persName>, one of the chiefs,
                    replied, <lb/><said who="lhill1">That what he had heard was very good, and that
                        they <lb/>had heard a number of such talks from thier great <lb/>father the
                        President; and he had promised to help <lb/>them, and keep off the whiskey
                        sellers, but he <lb/>had not done it: and now it was too late: he
                        <lb/>supposed he had tried, but could not; and had such <lb/>great matters
                        to attend to that he could not see to their <lb/>small concerns, and now it
                        was too late to help them.</said></p>
                <p>We then told them we did not believe it was too late, <lb/>for them to refrain
                    from drinking whiskey; we told them that <lb/>much that they had complained of
                    we believed to be true, and <lb/>that the white man had wronged them; but that
                    we wished <lb/>them to understand that they yet had good friends among <lb/>the
                    whites who were grieved with the conduct of bad white <lb/>men towards them; we
                    hoped they would not be disour- <lb/>aged, but strive to do better themselves,
                    and that we and <lb/>our brothers at home were disposed to do all in our <lb/>
                    power to help them; and after making on our part <lb/>some other remarks
                    relative to their condition, they ex- <lb/>pressed their satisfaction. <persName
                        key="lhill1">Little Hill</persName> spoke to some <lb/>of the elder Chiefs,
                    and as we understood requested them to <lb/>reply to us, as he was young, and
                    wanted some of his <lb/>older friends to make a speech. They <gap/> said
                    <lb/>they were well pleased with our talk, but had nothing <lb/>further to say.
                        <persName key="lhill1">Little Hill</persName> then arose and shook hands
                    <lb/>with us, and then commenced speaking to us through the <lb/>interpreter
                        <persName key="dlawr1">Young Lowry</persName>. Refering to their former con-
                    <lb/>dition previous to this intercourse with the whites, he <lb/>said the Great
                    Spirit had made us all, but he had <lb/>made us different. Some men he made
                    white, some <lb/>he made red; and placed them at a distance one <lb/>from the
                    other. They the red man lived happy, and <lb/>he supposed the white an lived
                    happy too. They <lb/>then had no sickness nor deaths amongst them except
                    <lb/>from old age; all thier people lived to be old and <lb/>white headed; but
                    when the white man came amongst <lb/>them, they then became sick and died young.
                    The <lb/>white man brought fire water amongst them--they <lb/>supposed that the
                    white man got the whiskey from <lb/>the bad Spirit, for surely they never got it
                    from the <lb/>Good Spirit. They began to sell it to the Indians <lb/>and then
                    thier miseries commenced; and they had be- <lb/>come reduced and could not
                    repair from drinking so <lb/>long as the white men sold it to them; and now
                    <lb/>they dispaired of ever being any better--and the only way <lb/>for them to
                    be made better was to keep the whiskey <lb/>away.</p>
                <p>The white man did not know what <lb/><pb n="113h" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_194"/>it was to go hungry and cold, but the poor
                    Indian did. <lb/>He believed that we pitied them and talked to them for thier
                    <lb/>good; and he thanked us for it, and said he would tell it <lb/>to his
                    people, and hoped they would mind our talk; to <lb/>which they all assented. He
                    then said, <said who="lhill1">Brothers, I have <lb/>nothing more to say.</said>
                    and shaking hands with us again sat down.</p>
                <p>After gathering the foregoing facts and obser- <lb/>vations respecting the
                        <orgName key="winne">Winnebago</orgName> Indians, and not seeing <lb/>that
                    much usefulness would result by a longer stay at <lb/>this place; we took leave
                    of our friend <persName key="dlawr1">Lowry</persName> and family <lb/>as well as
                    the other white inhabitants connected with them <lb/>at the establishment, and
                    returned to <placeName key="dubuq">Dubuque</placeName> on the <placeName
                        key="missi">Mis- <lb/>sissippi</placeName>. We then took Steam Boat down the
                    river <lb/>about Two hundred miles to <placeName key="burli1"
                        >Burlington</placeName>; from thence we <lb/>took State and private
                    conveyance by way of <placeName key="mtple">Mount <lb/>Pleasant</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="salem2">Salem, Iowa</placeName>, to the <orgName key="sacks"
                        >Sacks</orgName> and <orgName key="fox">Fox</orgName> Agency <lb/>distant
                    about eighty miles. We reached this place <lb/>8th of Tenth month about one o
                    clock P.M.</p>
                <p>The Tribe were at the time assebled for the <lb/>puropse of negotiating a Treaty
                    with our <orgName key="usag">General Government</orgName>
                    <lb/>through <persName key="gcham1">Governor John Chambers </persName>the
                    negotiator.</p>
                <p>The whole <orgName key="sacks">Sack</orgName> &amp; <orgName key="fox"
                        >Fox</orgName> nation were in the neighbor- <lb/>hood, but the men only
                    attended the Council. Just as <lb/>we reached the council the Chiefs commenced
                    speaking and <lb/>spoke with much animation. One of the <orgName key="fox"
                        >Fox</orgName> chiefs spoke <lb/>first, then a <orgName key="sacks"
                        >Sack</orgName>, and so alternately until four had spoken, <lb/>the last
                    being <persName key="kecoo1">Kecookuk</persName>, thier principal chief a cele-
                    <lb/>brated orator.</p>
                <p>The purport of thier talk was about the <lb/>same; and resulted in an agreement
                    to sell all their lands <lb/>in the United States for the sum of one million
                    fifty <lb/>five Thousand Dollars, Eight hundred Thousand of which <lb/>was to be
                    put at interest at 5 per cent, and the remain- <lb/>der to be appropriated to
                    the payment of thier debts; <lb/>south west of the <placeName key="misso"
                        >Missouri River</placeName> where they were to <lb/>remove within three
                    years.</p>
                <p>After the adjournment of the Council <lb/>at that time we went to the Agent's
                    house where the Governor <lb/>put up during his stay at this place. He received
                    us kindly <lb/>and entered into conversation very freely respecting the
                    <lb/>condition of this Tribe of Indians--he remarked that un- <lb/>less
                    something was done to better thier condition and <lb/>that soon; they must in a
                    very few years all be wastid <lb/>away in consequence of the wickedness and
                    treachery of the <lb/>whiskey sellers and other traders who are taking advan-
                    <lb/>tage of these poor ignorant natives, by obtaining thier <lb/>money and
                    other valuable articles, in exchange for <lb/>whiskey and other trifling
                    commodities of no real val- <lb/>ue to the Indians. These articles, he remarked,
                    are <lb/>frequently sold to them for ten or twenty and in some <lb/>instances
                    for one hundred times their real cost, and in <lb/>a very short time these
                    unprincipled traders manage to obtain the <lb/>last dollar the Indian has. And
                    further, he said <lb/>that some of the accounts brought in against the Indians
                    <lb/>stagger credulity; that in one instance one of these <lb/>was exhibited for
                    settlement amounting to Sixteen Thou-<lb/>sand Dollars, which he had ascertained
                    to have grown <lb/>out of the remnants of an old stock of goods not <lb/>worth
                    five hundred Dollars. He remarked that <lb/>whiskey was no doubt in many
                    instances sold to the In- <lb/>dians and charged as corn, blankets and other
                    articles <lb/>which the licensed traders may have a right to sell <lb/>to the
                    Indians; while it is unlawful to sell them <lb/>whiskey. He said also that the
                    advice of the <lb/>whiskey sellers and other traders, in its influence upon
                    <lb/>the Indians was unbounded; and that he had found <lb/>much difficulty in
                    treating with them on that account; <lb/>as they were constantly hanging about
                    them and advising <lb/>them against adopting such a course as would be for
                    <lb/>thier good, cautioning them not to leave the chase, <lb/>not lay down the
                    gun, nor the blanket--not to <lb/>have school, established amongst them; and in
                    fine <lb/>against civilization in any way. And from what <lb/>we saw and heard,
                    during our stay at the Council Ground, <lb/>we were led to place the most
                    implicit confidence in <lb/>the remarks of the Governor.</p>
                <p>While we were at the Council we met <lb/>with men of the popular class, some of
                    whom it is known <lb/>have been long engaged in a trade with the Indians by
                    <lb/>which they have amassed great wealth--these men used <lb/>their utmost
                    skill to make us believe that the Indians <lb/>were a happy people; that there
                    was no necessity <lb/>for any benevolent exertions on thier behalf, and that
                    <lb/>they were now living very comfortably.</p>
                <p>An Indian (say they) was made to hunt not <lb/><pb n="113j" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_195"/>to work; and they are so very
                    happy in keeping to thier <lb/>old habits of living, that any attempts to induce
                    a change <lb/>only serve to make them unhappy--they argued aga- <lb/>inst <del/>
                    educating the Indians <del/> altogether <lb/>either within or without thier
                    borders; saying that <lb/>they have as much knowledge as is necessary for an
                    <lb/>Indian to possess.</p>
                <p>There were also other men associated with these <lb/>traders either by friendship
                    or otherways; men of <lb/>high standing in the Public Community, who were for-
                    <lb/>ward in sustaining these traders in these selfish and <lb/>erroneous
                    statements. And what is most to be <lb/>deplored is, that the Indians will more
                    readily lis- <lb/>ten to the Council of these men than to those who <lb/>are
                    disinterstedly engaged for their good. The <lb/>only hope (according to our
                    conception of things) for <lb/>these Indians is, that when they shall be removed
                    <lb/>to their new homes, all intercourse with their old ad- <lb/>visers will be
                    broken off, and they as we hope, will <lb/>be left to receive better council
                    from men who are <lb/>not so intently bent upon thier own aggrandize- <lb/>ment
                    at the expense of the life and happiness of <lb/>the Indian.</p>
                <p>This Tribe numbers about Twenty Two hun- <lb/>dred in all. They are a large
                    stately race particular- <lb/>ly the men. There are none of these Indians who to
                    <lb/>our knowledge cultivate the soil; but are in general <lb/>hunters--they
                    however have a large pattern farm <lb/>carried on for the benefit of the Indians
                    by a Govern- <lb/>ment farmer. Thier annuities are large, not dif- <lb/>fering
                    materially from the <orgName key="winne">Winnebagoes</orgName>.</p>
                <p>They live in wigwams or lodges similar to <lb/>all the uncivilized Indians. They
                    have no schools <lb/>and no civil or religious instruction amongst them;
                    <lb/>but in other respects thier manners and customs are <lb/>about the same as
                    the <orgName key="winne">Winnebagoes</orgName>. Some few of their <lb/>children
                    have recieved some instruction at the <orgName key="choctaw">Chactaw</orgName>
                    <lb/>academy in <placeName key="kentu">Kentucky</placeName>; but for the want of
                    suitable <lb/>opportunity <del/> to apply what little learning <lb/>they may
                    have obtained, and in consequence of the <lb/>jealousy and prejudice of thier
                    own nation against <lb/>civilization; soon after thier return they fall
                    <lb/>into the destructive habits of thier uncivilized brethren.</p>
                <p>There was little opportunity while there of <lb/>conversing with them, owing to
                    thier engagements in <lb/>making their Treaty. We visited most of their tents
                    <lb/>and took a view of them as they were encamped on <lb/>the open prairie.</p>
                <p>After collecting what facts we could in relation <lb/>to this Tribe, we returned
                    to <placeName key="salem2">Salem</placeName> a distance of about <lb/>fifty
                    miles, where we staid two or three days with <lb/>Friends and gave them an
                    account of the Indians. <lb/>We then returned to the <geogName key="missi"
                        >Mississippi</geogName> where we took stage <lb/>at <placeName key="fmadi"
                        >Fort Madison</placeName> for <persName key="kecoo1">Kecookuk</persName>,
                    and from thence by <lb/>Steam Boat went to <placeName key="stlou">St.
                        Louis</placeName>--while there, we called <lb/>on <persName key="dmitc1">D.
                        D. Mitchel</persName> superintendent of Indian affairs. <lb/>He received us
                    kindly, we presented him with our <lb/>Documents from the War Department as well
                    as our <lb/>Certificates from our friends at home. He gave <lb/>us a passport to
                    travel through all the Tribes with- <lb/>in his superintendence.</p>
                <p>Here again the same lamentable tale was <lb/>told respecting the devastation that
                    whiskey was <lb/>making amongst all the diferent Tribes within his
                    <lb/>jurisdiction. He informed us that they were <lb/>annually diminishing in
                    numbers, and that unless <lb/>something more effectual could be devised for
                    their <lb/>benefit, by way of putting a stop to this iniquitous <lb/>trafic in
                    whiskey, they would soon be all wasted <lb/>away.</p>
                <p>He gave us copies of Reports recieved from <lb/>the several schools within his
                    superintendence, for <lb/>our perusal.</p>
                <p>We left <placeName key="stlou">St. Louis</placeName> by Stage for <placeName
                        key="stcha">St. Charles</placeName>
                    <lb/>a distance of twenty miles, thence took Steam <lb/>Boat for <placeName
                        key="westport">Westport</placeName> nearly five hundred miles up the
                        <lb/><placeName key="misso">Missouri River</placeName> where we landed in
                    safety; we then <lb/>proceeded by land about nine miles to Friends school
                    <lb/>in the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> nation. The navigation of
                    the <lb/><placeName key="misso">Missouri</placeName> at this time was considered
                    very precarious <lb/>on account of the low stage of water, and the nu-
                    <lb/>merous snags and shoals in the river: which <lb/>caused great anxiety to us
                    as well as to the officers <lb/>of the Boat, both by night and by day; yet
                    through <lb/><pb n="113l" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_196"/>all we were mercifully favoured to reach our de- sired port
                    unharmed.</p>
                <p>We reached the school early in the evening, where we <lb/>were cordially recieved
                    by all the Friends of the Establishment <lb/>and hospitably entertained.</p>
                <p>The day following we made arrangements for a Coun- <lb/>cil with the Indians,
                    viewed the premises &amp;c; and in the <lb/>evening we visited the school, heard
                    the scholars recite thier <lb/>Scripture questions, spell &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The school consisted of twenty three boys and four- <lb/>teen girls; we were
                    pleased with its appearance at this <lb/>and the subsequent visits that we made.
                    The scholars <lb/>manifisted a good degree of activity, and appeared cheerful
                    <lb/>and happy: they had made considerable proficiency in <lb/>thier studies, as
                    much as could reasonably be expected <lb/>under the circumstances in which they
                    were placed.</p>
                <p>They are taught in the English language and converse <lb/>in english with the
                    whites; but when conversing among <lb/>themselves they speak the Shawnee
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>Attached to this School is a large farm the income <lb/>of which goes to the
                    support of the family. The boys <lb/>work on the farm and are instructed in
                    agriculture: the <lb/>Institution being conducted somewhat on the plan of <lb/>a
                    manual labour school. We were well satisfied <lb/>with the appearance of the
                    farm.</p>
                <p>The buildings, were poor and ill adapted <lb/>to the wants of such and
                    Institution.</p>
                <p>This school is supported by the Yearly <lb/>Meetings of <orgName key="bym"
                        >Baltimore</orgName>, <orgName key="oym">Ohio</orgName>, and <orgName
                        key="iym">Indianna</orgName>.</p>
                <p>We made a visit to the <orgName key="metho">Methodist</orgName> Mission
                    <lb/>School distant about three miles from that of Friends; thier <lb/>buildings
                    are of brick and are large, and an extensive <lb/>farm is attached to the
                    Establishment: this school <lb/>is likewise conducted on the manual labour
                    plan.</p>
                <p>They instruct upwards of eighty children annually, <lb/>at this Institution. Our
                        <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> has done much <lb/>towards its
                    establishment, and the deficiency is made <lb/>up by the <orgName key="metho"
                        >Methodist</orgName> band. The children were making <lb/>tolerable progress
                    in the various studies in which they <lb/>were engaged; as well as in
                    agriculture and the mechan- <lb/>ic arts.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="bapt">Baptists</orgName> have also a small school in the
                        <lb/><orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> nation; but at the time of our
                    visit it was <lb/>vacated.</p>

                <p>After visiting the Schools, we called on several <lb/>families of the Indians;
                    many of whom appeared to be <lb/>living tolerably well, in comfortable log
                    houses. Some <lb/>of them have pretty good furniture, and utensils for
                    <lb/>cooking, &amp;c. Some have barns for their cattle, and other <lb/>out
                    buildings. They raise a supply of indian corn <lb/>for themselves and cattle,
                    and keep oxen, cows, horses hogs <lb/>and a few sheep. They all raise a large
                    number of <lb/>fowls; some of them have peach orchards, and have sent
                    <lb/>peaches to market the past season. Many of the <lb/>men of this Tribe are
                    industrious as well as the women.</p>
                <p>A few of the men are mechanics, and work by the <lb/>day for the white settlers,
                    and give satisfaction to thier <lb/>employers. They appear to be adopting the
                    dress, <lb/>and manners of the whites, and to be advancing slowly <lb/>in
                    civilization. It is reported, that some of them have <lb/>embraced christianity;
                    but most of them adhere to thier <lb/>ancient views of religion. A considerable
                    number <lb/>are yet given to dissipation.</p>
                <p>They all appear to have a high regard for Friends, <lb/>and recieved us kindly;
                    manifesting much interest with <lb/>our visit.</p>
                <p>We held a number of councils with them during <lb/>our stay in the nation, to
                    pretty good satisfaction; and <lb/>rendered them such advice as appeared proper;
                    to which <lb/>they listened with interest and attention--they were <lb/>apt at
                    making us acquainted with their grievances: <lb/>at one of their councils with
                    the Chiefs and head <lb/>men of the nation. The following speech was made,
                    <lb/>our certificates and documents having been previously <lb/>read, and we
                    having rendered them such council <lb/>and advice as way opened for.

                            <p>Brothers, <lb/>Perhaps it is the will of God, that we should
                                <lb/>meet to day to talk over things together; and if <lb/>there was
                                no trouble in the way, we could get <lb/>along much better in making
                                you a reply. You <lb/>know that when there is only a little trouble
                                in <lb/>the way we can not get along so well.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, We are glad to hear you talk, and <lb/>when we meet in this
                                way we think about God, and <lb/>talk about Him, for we believe it
                                is his will that <lb/><pb n="113n" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_197"/>we should think about Him, and talk about Him.
                                <lb/>We greet you as brothers, and send our love and best
                                <lb/>wishes to our friends the Quakers who sent you to <lb/>see us
                                their Indian brothers.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, This is not the first time our friends <lb/>the Quakers
                                have come to see us, to instruct us in <lb/>the things you have been
                                talking about to day. <lb/>A long time ago our friends the Quakers
                                gave us <lb/>the same instruction; and our young men who <lb/>are
                                seated around you at this time have heard <lb/>their talk, and now
                                live agreeable to their advice; <lb/>for we think that your way of
                                living is good.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, All our young men who are here to day <lb/>understand what
                                you say and like your talk: <lb/>they do not drink whiskey; but
                                work, raise corn <lb/>wheat, oats; and have horses, cows, sheep and
                                <lb/>hogs, and live comfortably and are saving some- <lb/>thing for
                                their children. As to my improvement <lb/>it is growing less as I
                                grow older.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, We that are seated around you believe <lb/>that what you
                                say is true; I have given up drink- <lb/>ing whiskey a long time
                                ago, and think about other <lb/>things. I think about God, and feel
                                that I <lb/>have religion in me. We believe that your <lb/>religion
                                is a good one; and your talk and your <lb/>feelings towards the
                                Indians are good and right.</p>
                            <p>A long time ago your old men talked to us about <lb/>your religion;
                                and we told them about our religion, <lb/>and they told us that
                                though your religion was <lb/>different from our religion; yet if
                                the heart was <lb/>right, we could travel together through the world
                                <lb/>and be saved at last.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, You say that you have come a long <lb/>journey to see your
                                Indian brothers, and now you <lb/>see we are in a bad condition
                                (alluding to their <lb/>head Chief who was present in a state of
                                intoxication) <lb/>like some of our Indian brothers whom you
                                <lb/>have been to see. We can not help it, so long <lb/>as the white
                                men will sell whiskey to the Indians.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, We want you to talk to our great <lb/>Father the President
                                about the white man selling <lb/>whiskey to the Indians. Our Great
                                Father can pre- <lb/>vent it, but no one else can. We want that
                                <lb/>he should stop up the barrel, and not suffer any <lb/>to
                                run out to the Indians.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, As to the School, we can not do much, <lb/>we can talk to
                                our people about sending their chil- <lb/>den; but if parents will
                                not send their children <lb/>we can not help it. If you get along
                                well <lb/>with the children you now have, parents will <lb/>see it
                                and become willing to send their children; <lb/>as they wish them to
                                learn to work, and read <lb/>and write like white people.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, We believe that all you have said <lb/>to us is true; and
                                we wish you to carry this talk <lb/>of ours home with you, and tell
                                our friends the <lb/>Quakers all about what you have seen amongst
                                <lb/>your <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> friends--that
                                many of them have <lb/>good farms, raise stock--viz, horses, cows,
                                sheep <lb/>and hogs, and many of them do not drink <lb/>whiskey; but
                                have good houses, good furniture, <lb/>and live comfortably.</p>
                            <p>Brothers, That is all I have to say.</p><dateline><date when="1842"/></dateline>

                <p>The <orgName key="kicka">Kickapoo</orgName> Tribe of Indians.</p>
                <p>After spending some time with the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName>, we
                    hired horses <lb/>and an Indian guide and rode up the <placeName key="misso"
                        >Missouri River</placeName> about fifty <lb/>miles to the <orgName
                        key="kicka">Kickapoo</orgName>'s a small Tribe of about four hundred
                    <lb/>situated above <placeName key="fleav">Fort Leavenworth</placeName> on the
                        <placeName key="misso">Missouri</placeName>.</p>
                <p>They are nearly all agriculturalists, raising a sufficien- <lb/>cy of corn for
                    themselves and some to sell; they also raise <lb/>some wheat, potatoes and other
                    vegetables, and keep horses <lb/>cattle and hogs; some of them live tolerably
                    comfortable; <lb/>their cabins generally are filthy; and some of them
                    <lb/>exceedingly so. They have no school in this Tribe. <lb/>A number of them
                    belong to the Society of <orgName key="metho">Methodists</orgName>; <lb/>others
                    are the followers of an Indian man whom they <lb/>call the Prophet, a man of
                    some talent, but said to be <lb/><pb n="113p" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_198"/>an arch deciever. The greatest number
                    still adhere to <lb/>thier old traditions. The general appearances of these
                    <lb/>Indians was filthy; many are much given to dissipation <lb/>and other
                    vices; especially those residing near the Fort.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="metho">Methodists</orgName> have a Missionary in this
                    Tribe.</p>
                <p>We held a Council with them and endeavoured <lb/>to lay before them what appeared
                    porper; persuading <lb/>them to leave their bad practices, and become sober and
                    <lb/>virtuous. There were present at this Council about <lb/>thirty of their
                    Chiefs and principal men. They <lb/>heard what we said to them very attentively;
                    but not <lb/>being ready to reply, requested another interview.</p>
                <p>Accordingly a number of them met us in the evening <lb/>and after consulting for
                    a time among themselves, made <lb/>the following reply through one of thier

                    wants. Said they were poor <lb/>and had no waggons to gather thier corn in, and
                    <lb/>carry it to market. They had no ploughs, thier <lb/>mills were out of
                    repair, and thier young men <lb/>had to go to mill near the whiskey shops,
                    and <lb/>they would get drunk. They said these things were <lb/>due to them by
                    Treaty Stipulation; and that their <lb/>great father had promised to attend to
                    these things, <lb/>but had not. They wished us to go and see <lb/>him and let
                    him know what they said.</p>
                <p>After this talk they took us by the hand and <lb/>parted with us in a very kindly
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The next morning <date when="1842-11-03">3d. of eleventh month 1842</date>
                    <lb/>we returned on our way back, as far as the <orgName key="stockbridge"
                        >Stockbridge</orgName>
                    <lb/>Tribe, a small remnant of a once numerous Tribe <lb/>of Indians; but at
                    this time numbering only seventy seven. <lb/>They were originally from New
                    England. We reached <lb/>the house of the principal chief, <persName
                        key="thend1">Thomas T. Hendrick</persName>
                    <lb/>about eleven o clock A.M., having previously made an <lb/>arrangement for
                    meeting with them. He had a long <lb/>trumpet which he made use of to collect
                    the Tribe; <lb/>which being sounded, they soon come together, men <lb/>women and
                    children. They all set down in an <lb/>orderly manner, like a company of
                    Friends.</p>
                <p>We had a religious opportunity with them great- <lb/>ly to our peace and comfort,
                    and as they nearly all <lb/>understood some english, we spoke to them without
                    <lb/>an interpreter; it being the first instance of our ad- <lb/>dressing a
                    company of Indians in this manner.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the adults of this Tribe <lb/>are professors of Christianity.
                    The principal Chief <lb/>is a sober sensible man. After we had relieved <lb/>our
                    minds to them, he spoke some time to his people <lb/>in the Indian tongue,
                    referring as we understood to <lb/>what had been said. One of their number, a
                    young <lb/>man who had recieved an education at some of the <lb/>schools in
                        <placeName key="connt">Connecticut</placeName> was requested by the Chief,
                    to say <lb/>to us that they understood all we had said to them, <lb/>and that it
                    was all true; and he hoped they might <lb/>often think of it, and improve from
                    it.</p>
                <p>They said they considered it a great favour from <lb/>God that He had sent us to
                    see them, and give them <lb/>such good advice. The Quakers had always been
                    <lb/>friends to the Indians, and had never wronged them; <lb/>other white men
                    had. They had heard much <lb/>about the Quakers, and considered them thier
                    friends</p>
                <p>They said they noticed our advice to them to endeavour to <lb/><pb n="113r" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_199"/>forget the
                    injuries done them by the <lb/>whites, and he hoped they might practice it.</p>
                <p>They said they were a very little company, but <lb/>they had long resolved to
                    improve and live like <lb/>good white men. They had given up hunting <lb/>and
                    drinking whiskey; and were trying to live <lb/>by farming. They wished us to
                    tell our friends at <lb/>the east, that they were going to build a school
                    <lb/>house and have a school for thier children.</p>
                <p>They appeared to be very sincere in thier remarks, <lb/>and we were encouraged to
                    hope that they would <lb/>continue on in thier improvements. They were
                    <lb/>further advanced in civilization than any of the <lb/>Tribes we had
                    previously visited. The Chief<lb/><persName key="thend1">Thomas T
                        Hendrick</persName>, had quite a library of books <lb/>and could write
                    tolerably well. They complained <lb/>that they had not recieved thier portion of
                    the money <lb/>due them for the lands sold the <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName> at <placeName key="greeb">Green <lb/>Bay</placeName>,
                    that they were promised this money at the time <lb/>of thier removal; but have
                    not yet had it: and <lb/>that they needed it in carrying on thier farming op-
                    <lb/>erations, and were now suffering for want of it-- <lb/>that they were poor
                    and not able to go to <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>
                    <lb/>but desired that friends would lend them some as- <lb/>sistance in getting
                    thier just dues.</p>
                <p>We accidentally met with an aged female <lb/>Indian residing not far from this
                    settlement of <orgName key="stockbridge">Stock- <lb/>bridges</orgName> who
                    appeared perfectly bright although she <lb/>had lived to the advanced age of
                    seventy four years <lb/>She was living in a small log cabin, her name <lb/>is
                        <persName key="cever1">Catherine Everett</persName>, she told us that when
                    she was <lb/>a child, she lived at <placeName key="eaves">Eavesham New
                        Jersey</placeName>, and that <lb/>she was well acquainted with friends, and
                    said she knew <lb/>that dear old friend <persName key="jevan1">Joshua
                        Evans</persName>, the man who wore <lb/>a long beard. She said she thought
                    him the best man <lb/>in the world, he was so very good to the poor Indians,
                    <lb/>and she always loved the Quakers from her childhood, <lb/>and thought a
                    great deal about her good friends in <lb/>the east; and she believed they prayed
                    both for her <lb/>and for the Indians in the west; and that thier pray- <lb/>ers
                    were heard and answered;and that she rejoiced <lb/>that the Lord had remembered
                    them, and sent the <lb/>Quakers to see them and encourage them; for they
                    <lb/>needed it. She knew she was a poor ignorant old <lb/>creature; but
                    sometimes she hoped to be permitted to <lb/>meet her Saviour in that Mansion
                    where Christ had <lb/>gone to prepare for his followers; where there was <lb/>no
                    difference between the white man and the red man <lb/>for she thought there
                    would be but one place for <lb/>the good white man, and the good red man; and
                    <lb/>one place for the bad white man and the bad Indian</p>
                <p>She desired we and our friends would remember <lb/>the poor Indian in the west.
                    Sometimes she <lb/>awoke in the morning, her soul was filled with love <lb/>to
                    God and all mankind: to a great many that she <lb/>never saw in this world. She
                    said she knew she was <lb/>a very poor old woman and had been very wicked,
                    <lb/>but hoped the Lord would forgive her; and she <lb/>was sometimes comforted
                    in remembering that Christ <lb/>said; he that cometh to him he would not cast
                    <lb/>off. She said she wanted we should give her <lb/>love to our brethren in
                    the East; and desired <del/><lb/>them to pray for her, for she was a poor crea-
                    <lb/>ture. The fervent prayer of a righteous man <lb/>said she avails much.
                    Sometimes she was very <lb/>sick and thought she should die, and at those times
                    <lb/>she thought she should be happy; for her soul <lb/>was filled with love to
                    God and to everybody. <lb/>She wanted to think of God all the time; it made
                    <lb/>her so well in her heart, putting her hand to her <lb/>breast. When we were
                    about parting with her <lb/>she appeared much affected; so that the tears rolled
                    <lb/>down her furrowed cheek. She observed we might <lb/>never meet again in
                    this world, for it was but a little <lb/>time that we had to stay here--but we
                    should meet <lb/>again in another world where there would be no <lb/>more
                    trouble. I am said she, a poor red creature, <lb/>and dont know much, but I feel
                    to love God, that <lb/>has done so much for me through Christ.</p>
                <p>We next visited the <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>,</p>
                <p>They are situated on the west side of the <placeName key="kansar">Kansas
                        <lb/>River</placeName>, opposite the <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnees</orgName>, and number about <lb/>one Thousand souls. They have an
                    excellent <lb/>country, calculated to support a large population.</p>
                <p>About one half of them are in an improving <lb/>condition; cultivating corn and
                    vegetables -- <lb/><pb n="113t" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_200"/>They keep horses cattle and hogs and an abundance
                    <lb/>of fowls. Most of them live in comfortable log <lb/>or timber houses, and
                    are advancing slowly in civilization. <lb/>Some few of them have cast off the
                    blankey, and adop- <lb/>ted the dress and manners of the whites, have given up
                    <lb/>drinking whiskey and send thier children to school-- <lb/>a large portion
                    of them however yet remain in an <lb/>uncivilized state, wear the blanket, hunt
                    some, and man- <lb/>ifest no disposition to improve in anything good.</p>
                <p>They drink whiskey, fight and are addicted to all <lb/>the views common to the
                    Indian in his savage state.</p>
                <p>Some of these are celebrated hunters and warriors <lb/>and often fight thier way
                    through the wild Tribes <lb/>quite to the <placeName key="rockm">Rocky
                        Mountains</placeName>. They kill the <lb/><placeName key="buffa"
                        >Buffalo</placeName> and bring home the skins, and barter them <lb/>away
                    with the traders for whiskey and other articles, <lb/>such as beads wampum
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Thier near location to the line of <lb/><placeName key="missouri"
                        >Missouri</placeName>, and the whiskey sellers and other traders who
                    <lb/>settle on or near the line operates as a great hindrance <lb/>to thier
                    improvement; and will continue to be a bar <lb/>in the way of thier advancement
                    while these un- <lb/>principled traders are suffered to carry on a trafic
                    <lb/>with them. Every advantage appears to be taken <lb/>of thier ignorance as
                    well as thier natural thirst <lb/>for drinking.</p>
                <p>We met with two of thier principal <lb/>Chiefs and some of thier head men at the
                        <orgName key="bapt">Bap- <lb/>tist</orgName> Missionary house, and rendered
                    them such <lb/>advice as appeared to us proper upon subjects <lb/>relating to
                    thier welfare; all of which they <lb/>appeared to recieve kindly according to
                    thier <lb/>reply.</p>
                <p>They refered to the friendship which <lb/>had long existed between the Quakers
                    and the <lb/><orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, and said that this
                    friendship had <lb/>never been broken; and after speaking of the <lb/>wrongs
                    that had been practiced upon them by <lb/>some of the whites, they said, the
                    Quakers had <lb/>never injured them; that they had never opened <lb/>thier viens
                    nor so much as scratched them.</p>
                <p>They were pleased that we had thought <lb/>so much about them as to come so great
                    a distance <lb/>to see them. They hoped they should mind what <lb/>we had
                    said to them and try to improve.</p>
                <p>The chief said he was sorry that there were <lb/>no more of his people present on
                    this occasion; <lb/>but hoped we should not be discouraged, for it was <lb/>a
                    pity for any one to begin to do good and then <lb/>give it up.</p>
                <p>There are quite a number of was chiefs be- <lb/>longing to this Tribe, who
                    refused to meet with <lb/>thier brethren on this occasion; having at a previous
                    <lb/>time met and heard some remarks touching thier <lb/>dissipation and other
                    immoral practices with which <lb/>they were not well pleased, and were decidedly
                    <lb/>opposed to meeting again on such an occasion.</p>
                <p>We did not however feel satisfied to leave <lb/>without seeking an opportunity
                    with them; and <lb/>accordingly appointed a time when we would <lb/>like to meet
                    them at one of thier own houses: <lb/>and when the time came we met some ten
                    <lb/>fifteen of them, and addressed them on subjects <lb/><del/>relating to
                    thier moral and religious welfare, <lb/>to all of which they expressed thier
                    satisfaction; <lb/>saying they were glad to have us talk, and hoped <lb/>they
                    should mind what had been said to them.</p>
                <p>Although these fierce looking warriors had <lb/>previously made some secere
                    threats against the <lb/>first man who should name these subjects to them;
                    <lb/>they offered no violence or unkind treatment to <lb/>us; but appeared very
                    attentive and willing to <lb/>hear us speak with freedom on all the subjects
                    <lb/>relating to thier welfare; and them addressed <lb/>us in a kind manner.</p>
                <p>The head Chief saying he was glad <lb/>to see his dear brothers and hear them
                    talk, and <lb/>hoped they should mind what was said to them.</p>
                <p>We them parted with them feeling much <lb/>relieved, and they manifesting much
                    affectionate <lb/>feeling towards us.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="moravian">Moravians</orgName>, <orgName key="metho"
                        >Methodists</orgName>, and <lb/><orgName key="bapt">Baptists</orgName>, have
                    each separate missions among the <lb/><orgName key="delaware"
                        >Delawares</orgName>.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="bapt">Baptists</orgName> have a small school <lb/>where some
                    ten of fifteen children are annually <lb/><pb n="113v" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_201"/>receiving some instruction.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="moravian">Moravians</orgName> are educating a larger number in
                    <lb/>that portion of the Tribe called <orgName key="munseeind"
                    >Munsees</orgName>. The <orgName key="bapt">Baptist</orgName>
                    <lb/>school was not in operation when we were there.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="metho">Methodists</orgName> have a Missionary but no school.
                    <lb/>A few of the <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName> children are
                    recieving some ed- <lb/>ucation at the several schools in the <orgName
                        key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> nation.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="munseeind">Munsee</orgName> Indians, consisting of about Two
                    hun- <lb/>dred are a branch of the <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName>
                    nation, and former- <lb/>ly resided on the <placeName key="lehig">Lehigh

                        <lb/>sylvania</placeName>; and as we understood these Indians are the
                    <lb/>descendents of the Tribe that made the Treaty with <lb/><persName
                        key="wpenn1">William Penn </persName>under the great Elm Tree.</p>
                <p>This memorable event has been handed down by <lb/>tradition from generation to
                    generation; and there are <lb/>now a number who can give a pretty correct
                    history of the <lb/>transactions of that remote period.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="moravian">Moravian</orgName> brethren have extended a care
                    towards <lb/>a portion of this Tribe for more than half a century.</p>
                <p>Teachers and Missionaries have ever since that time <lb/>been employed amongst
                    them, and at the time of our <lb/>visit there were two men and thier wives
                    engaged <lb/>in giving them some literary moral, and religious in-
                    <lb/>struction. They appeared to be pious persons and <lb/>honestly engaged in
                    the discharge of thier arduous <lb/>duties. They recieved as cordially and
                    manifested a <lb/>willingness to assist us in promoting the object of our
                    <lb/>visit.</p>
                <p>Owing to the unsettled state of these Indians, <lb/>thier wandering habits, and
                    an unwillingness to work <lb/>on the land; and the small annuity paid them by <del/>
                    <lb/><orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>; there has not been that
                    improvement that <lb/>might be reasonably looked for when we take into con-
                    <lb/>sideration the great amount of labour bestowed upon them</p>
                <p>Most of them have log or timber houses, and <lb/>cultivate more or less land; and
                    raise corn for thier <lb/>supply during the year. Some few cultivate wheat,
                    <lb/>and potatoes. They keep horses, cattle, hogs and <lb/>fowls. They have some
                    furniture in thier houses; <lb/>such as poor beds, tables, and chairs; some
                    cooking <lb/>utensils &amp;c. They all wear the blanket, and in <lb/>many
                    respects dress in a state about half way <lb/>between the whites and Indians.
                    They are great <lb/>smokers, and some of them drink whiskey to excess.</p>
                <p>It is said they are a kind hearted people, and a num- <lb/>ber of them have
                    embraced christianity, and joined either <lb/>with the <orgName key="moravian"
                        >Moravians</orgName>, <orgName key="metho">Methodists</orgName> or <orgName
                        key="episc">Episcopalians</orgName>.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="moravian">Moravians</orgName> have a small meeting house, and
                    school <lb/>house on thier land. We met sixty or seventy of these <lb/>Indians
                    of both sexes at thier meeting house on first <lb/>day evening; they behaved
                    themselves with sobriety and <lb/>christian gravity; and after we had freed our
                    minds <lb/>and our certificates had been read, one of the chiefs <lb/>of the
                        <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, after having spoken to his
                    associate <lb/>chief a few words (both of whom were at a previous meet- <lb/>ing
                    of ours) rose and delivered the following remarks.</p>
                <p>Brothers, We are glad you have come to see us, <lb/>and give us such good advice,
                    and to talk with us <lb/>and tell us about living better and becoming better
                    <lb/>men and women</p>
                <p>Brothers, I hope I shall do better myself, and <lb/>that my people will do better
                    also. Brothers, <lb/>our fathers and your fathers lived together as friends
                    <lb/>and brothers, they never shed each other's blood, no, <lb/>they never
                    scratched each other, and I am glad the <lb/>friendship continues even to the
                    present time, and <lb/>that the blood now runs freely in our viens &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, one of the principal men belong- <lb/>ing to the <orgName
                        key="munseeind">Munsees</orgName> made a few feeling remarks ex-
                    <lb/>pressive of his satisfaction with the meeting; where <lb/>it closed.</p>
                <p>Second day morning, being informed by the <orgName key="moravian"
                        >Moravian</orgName>
                    <lb/>Missionary that they usually met every morning at <lb/>nine o clock for
                    worship, and that there was liberty <lb/>for us to go in and sit with them if we
                    chose; after <lb/>reflecting upon it we thought it might be best for us <lb/>to
                    attend the Meeting; and accordingly we went in and <lb/>set with them until
                    thier services were over, after <lb/>which we had some labour amongst them. One
                    <lb/>of thier principal men then rose, and in a feeling <lb/>and broken manner,
                    even unto tears, made the fol- <lb/>lowing very affectionate and pertinent
                    remarks.</p>
                <p>Brothers, I want to talk a little with you, <lb/>I am glad to see you this
                    morning, and glad to hear <lb/>you talk about Jesus, and was glad to see you and
                    <lb/>hear you yesterday. Brothers the <orgName key="munseeind">munsees</orgName>
                    are <lb/><pb n="113x" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_202"/>spread all about, and have now no chiefs; some <lb/>few are
                    settled round here--some are mixed with the <lb/><orgName key="stockbridge"
                        >Stockbridge</orgName>'s--some with the <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnee</orgName>'s, and some are <lb/>yet living at <placeName key="greeb"
                        >Green Bay</placeName>. But the <orgName key="munseeind">Munsees</orgName>
                    have <lb/>all forsook thier heathen customs, and practices of <lb/>thier
                    forefathers, and now live in the customs and <lb/>practices of the Christians.
                    Some of these that live <lb/>round here are <orgName key="moravian"
                        >Moravians</orgName>, and some that live in <lb/>other places are <orgName
                        key="metho">Methodist</orgName> and some <orgName key="episco"
                        >Episcopalians</orgName>. <lb/>But they are <orgName key="munseeind"
                        >Munsees</orgName> let them live where they <lb/>will, and all live as the
                    Christian people do, and <lb/>do not follow the heathen practices of thier
                    <del/><lb/>fathers. Brothers, I do not live in heathen prac- <lb/>tices but
                    believe in the one true God and Jesus <lb/>Christ--me a poor Indian; me feel
                    very poor, <lb/>but me feel religion in me though very poor. <lb/>poor Indian
                    believe that God sent his son into <lb/>this world, and that he died for all
                    poor Indian <lb/>as well as white people; and I believe He is now <lb/>with God
                    in Heaven, and that He comes into our <lb/>hearts by his spirit, even poor
                    Indian's and will <lb/>be there forever. Now me think what Christ <lb/>say to
                    his followers <quote type="biblical">I am going away to leave <lb/>you, but I will
                        come again in Spirit into your <lb/>hearts that I may be with you forever,
                        be <lb/>where you will</quote> and now me feel him re- <lb/>newedly in my
                    heart at this time.</p>
                <p>Brothers, I speak these things not from the <lb/>tongue, but I feel what I say in
                    my heart, tho, <lb/>Indian a very poor creature, and like little child <lb/>in
                    these things, yet me feel the Spirit of Christ with <lb/>me this morning and
                    feel glad to see you and to <lb/>hear the good advice you have given us, and I
                    <lb/>feel my spiritual strength renewed.</p>
                <p>Brothers, Your fathers <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName> and
                    <lb/>other of your old men, and our old men the <orgName key="munseeind">Mun-
                        <lb/>sees</orgName> lived in peace like brothers, and made the <lb/>Treaty
                    under the Elm Tree, and the Quakers and <lb/><orgName key="munsee"
                        >munseeind</orgName> have always been friends; and my heart <lb/>is glad you
                    still think about your poor Indian <lb/>brethern and come and see them, for it
                    makes <lb/>poor Indians heart glad when they see thier Qua- <lb/>ker brothers.
                    Brothers, that is all I have to say now.</p>
                

                <p>An account of the <orgName key="kansas">Kansas</orgName>.</p>
                <p>This Tribe number about sixteen hundred souls; the <lb/>country they claim as
                    thier own is situated on both <lb/>sides of the <placeName key="kansar">Kansas
                        river</placeName>, commencing sixty miles west <lb/>of its nouth in latitude
                    about 38 [degrees] north, and is thirty <lb/>miles wide. The soil is fruitful
                    and well watered; <lb/>but sparingly timbered; it is well adapted to agric-
                    <lb/>ulture, and the climate is healthy.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="kansas">Kansas</orgName> spend a part of thier time in
                    <lb/>hunting, a part in idleness, and a part in planting <lb/>and cultivating
                    small crops at home. They are <lb/>irregular in thier manner of living; and
                    though <lb/>not inclined to eat unwholesome food, yet from ne- <lb/>cessity they
                    eat such as causes sickness amongst them. <lb/>They use ardent spirits less than
                    many other tribes, <lb/>yet they are degraded and improvident to some ex-
                    <lb/>tent by this poison--some few of them have <lb/>become reformed; they are
                    more ready to receive <lb/>instruction than they were formerly, but most <lb/>of
                    them are strongly inclined to hold to thier <lb/>savage habits and superstitious
                    worship.</p>
                <p>The main difficulties in teaching these Indians, <lb/>are their wandering habits,
                    and thier fondness for <lb/>war with other Tribes--they are at home only
                    <lb/>about four months in the year--they have a <lb/>Smith and a teacher of
                    agriculture furnished <lb/>them by Treaty who are to continue with them
                    <lb/>five years and then all thier stipulations with <lb/>the <orgName
                        key="usag">Government</orgName> will end.</p>
                <p>At the time of our visit the greater <lb/>part of this Tribe were gone on thier
                    Fall hunt, <lb/>and therefore we had an opportunity of seeing but <lb/>few of
                    them.</p>
                <p>After we had completed our visit <lb/>to the <orgName key="delaware"
                        >Delawares</orgName>, <orgName key="munseeind">Munsees</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName>'s and <lb/><orgName key="kicka"
                        >Kickapoos</orgName>, and had seen some of the <orgName key="kansas"
                        >Kansas</orgName>
                    <lb/>Tribe, and collected such information as we <lb/>deemed useful; we returned
                    again to Friend's <lb/>school in the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName>
                    Nation to prepare for our <lb/>visit to the more southern Tribes.</p>
                <p>The Indians understanding that we were <lb/>about leaving this part of the
                    Country, numbers <lb/>of them came to make known to us thier grievances
                    <lb/><pb n="113z" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_203"/>and others to take leave of us. They represented <lb/>to us that there
                    was a prospect of the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandotts</orgName>, <lb/>(now
                    living in <placeName key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>) coming to settle on a part of
                    <lb/>of thier land; and that a very few of the <orgName key="shawnee">Shaw-
                        <lb/>neese</orgName> were favourable to such a move, but that <lb/>the most
                    of them were decidedly opposed to it and <lb/>much troubled on account of it. We
                    were not <lb/>without serious apprehensions <del/> that <lb/>great difficulty
                    might yet arise from this circum- <lb/>stance. We rendered them such counsel as
                    <lb/>we believed might be proper for them to follow, <lb/>advising them against
                    discords, jealousies and <lb/>divisions, all of which appeared to be kindly
                    reci-eved.</p>
                <p>An aged <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> Chief came to us and said
                    <lb/>he wished to have a talk with us. He said when he <lb/>lived in <placeName
                        key="ohio">Ohio</placeName> he had a good farm and lived well, <lb/>and was
                    acquainted with friends, but by moving to <lb/>this country he had become
                    poor--that he was <lb/>now gaining a little and wanted to live where <lb/>he now
                    did, and so did all his Tribe want to him <lb/>where they now are--they did not
                    want to be <lb/>moved again, but feared they should be soon. he <lb/>said he was
                    now old and lame, he could not go <lb/>farther. he wanted to die and be buried
                    here <lb/>and not go away off and die on the prairie.</p>
                <p>It made him feel very bad to think of being moved <lb/>again for it seemed like
                    being thrown over a bank away <lb/>off west of the prairie where they would all
                    die--he <lb/>appeared much distressed on this amount. he wished to <lb/>know if
                    we had heard the men at <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName> talk
                    <lb/>about removing them again and remarked that he <lb/>had heard they had been
                    talking about it--he <lb/>wanted we and our friends the Quakers should <lb/>help
                    them in getting the titles of thier lands fixed <lb/>so that his people might
                    always live where they <lb/>now are. he thought the white man ought to <lb/>be
                    satisfied that the Indian had been moved far <lb/>enough, and not move him any
                    further. he <lb/>said he was an old man and could live but a <lb/>little while;
                    and wanted to know before he died <lb/>that his people and children could never
                    be <lb/>moved again--all of which was spoken in a <lb/>feeling and candid
                    manner.</p>
                <p>After this a Chief of the <orgName key="chili">Chilicothe</orgName> band
                    <lb/>remarked that the Indians showed mercy to the <lb/>white man when they
                    first come across the great <lb/>water; the white man came to the Indian four
                    <lb/>times with his hat under his arm, and asked the <lb/>Indian to have mercy
                    on him, for he was poor <lb/>and needy. White man say when Indian is <lb/>poor
                    and needy he would have mercy on him, <lb/>as long as grass grows and water
                    runs.</p>
                <p>Indian then let him come on the land <lb/>and live, he now wanted white man to
                    re- <lb/>member his promise and have mercy on the <lb/>Indian for he was poor
                    and needy; and not <lb/>remove him any further.</p>
                <p>Having completed our visit to the Indians <lb/>in this section of the Country, we
                    took leave of our <lb/>kind friends at the <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnee</orgName> school on the tenth <lb/>of eleventh month, and proceed
                    on our way about <lb/>forty miles in a southwest direction to the sub. agency
                    <lb/>of <persName key="adavi1">A L Davis</persName> in order to visit the
                    several Tribes <lb/>in that vicinity. We arrived there in the evening <lb/>of
                    the same day, and made known our business <lb/>to the sub. agent. He kindly
                    entertained us and <lb/>offered to lend all the necessary aid in collecting
                    <lb/>the Indians; and also to furnish us with such <lb/>information as he
                    possessed respecting thier state <lb/>and condition. The day following there was
                    <lb/>an unusual fall of snow for the season in con- <lb/>sequence of which but
                    few of the Indians came <lb/>to the council--yet some of the principal men
                    <lb/>of nearly all these remnants of Tribes were pres- <lb/>ent. The names of
                    the several Tribes are <lb/><orgName key="wea">Weas</orgName>
                    <orgName key="piank">Peankshaws</orgName>, <orgName key="kaska"
                        >Kaskaskias</orgName>, <orgName key="peoria">Peorias</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="odawa">Ottawas</orgName>, <lb/>and <orgName key="ojibwe"
                        >Chippewas</orgName>; numbering in all about Five <lb/>hundred and
                    fifty.</p>
                <p>These Indians are making but <lb/>little improvement in agriculture or otherwise,
                    <lb/>yet most of them raise some corn and veg- <lb/>atables, and keep some
                    cattle, horses, hogs and <lb/>fowls--they are but poorly prepared for carry-
                    <lb/>ing on farming; having no ploughs, waggons <lb/>or tools of any kind, which
                    is cause of much <lb/><pb n="113ab" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_204"/>discouragement to them.</p>
                <p>With the exception of a few instances they <lb/>have made but little advancement
                    in civilization. <lb/>Some of them live in poor log houses, and some <lb/>in
                    wigwams--they generally wear the blanket, <lb/>and in most respects dress like
                    the wild Indians.</p>
                <p>They are much given to idleness, vice, and dissi- <lb/>pation. they have no
                    school in any of these <lb/>Tribes--there is one Missionary amongst the <orgName
                        key="peoria">Peorias</orgName>, <lb/>but none in any of the others.</p>
                <p>Like many other Tribes they are fast <lb/>wasting away. Some of them are
                    professors of <lb/>Christianity, but much the larger part of them still
                    <lb/>adhere to thier old traditions.</p>
                <p>They complain of having made a bad <lb/>Treaty with the <orgName key="usag"
                        >General Government</orgName>, and are solic- <lb/>itous of further
                    assistance from that source; and <lb/>say that if thier Great Father would send
                    out some <lb/>good white men to instruct and advise them <lb/>they would
                    endeavour to improve from it. We <lb/>encouraged them to break off from thier
                    old habits <lb/>of dissipation and indolence, and to become a sober <lb/>and
                    agricultural people; holding out to them the <lb/>advantage that would arise
                    from such a change.</p>
                <p>They manifestid much interest in what was <lb/>said to them, saying they believed
                    it all to be true, <lb/>and hoped they might follow our advice. They
                    <lb/>promised that they would tell thier absent broth- <lb/>ers what had been
                    said to them and advise them <lb/>to mind it. They were pleased that we came
                    <lb/>so far to see them and parted with us in a frien- <lb/>dly manner</p>
                <p>After collecting the foregoing account re- <lb/>specting those small Tribes, we
                    left for the <orgName key="potaw">Pot- <lb/>awatomie</orgName> nation, situated
                    on <placeName key="potawc">Potawatomie creek</placeName>
                    <lb/>about sixty miles from <persName key="adavi1">A L Davis</persName>' agency.
                    We <lb/>arrived at the house of a man by the name of <lb/><persName key="simm1"
                        >Simmerwell</persName> a smith employed by the <orgName key="usag">General
                        <lb/>Government</orgName> in repairing the Indian guns &amp;c. <lb/>The day
                    being too far spent for a council <lb/>with them that evening, we thought it
                    most <lb/>advisable to have notice given for a meeting <lb/>with them in
                    the morning.</p>
                <p>This smith has been for many years engaged <lb/>amongst the Indians, in repairing
                    their guns and <lb/>otherwise assisting them. We believed him sincere- <lb/>ly
                    devoted to thier welare; he lamented thier de- <lb/>plorable condition; and from
                    his own personal <lb/>knowledge of the facts attributed most of thier
                    <lb/>misery to the avarice and wickedness of the traders <lb/>and other corrupt
                    white men, who have ever since <lb/>his requaintance been prowling about them
                    like <lb/>the beast for his prey.</p>
                <p>Agreeably to our previous appointment we <lb/>met a number of the Chiefs and head
                    men of <lb/>the nation at the house of the blacksmith.</p>
                <p>We endeavoured to impress upon thier minds <lb/>the importance of a change in all
                    thier habits <lb/>and modes of living, and to adopt the manners <lb/>and habits
                    of good white men. They listened <lb/>attentively to what was communicated to
                    them and <lb/>expressed thier gratitude towards the society of <lb/>Friends,
                    that they had thought so much of them <lb/>as to send persons so far to look
                    into their con- <lb/>dition. One of thier Chiefs remarked that <lb/>thier great
                    father had promised to send them ma- <lb/>ny things, but said he, they have not
                    yet got <lb/>along.</p>
                <p>The person who interpreted for us is a full <lb/>blood Indian, educated at
                    Hamilton School in the <lb/>State of <placeName key="newyo">New
                    York</placeName>, and speaks and writes the engl- <lb/>ish language well; he
                    also converses freely in <lb/>the Potawatomie tongue, and may be reckoned
                    <lb/>among the most intilligent of the Indians in the <lb/>west. he is married
                    to a half blood woman <lb/>and possesses very considerable property; and might
                    <lb/>have been rich, but for his great extravagance <lb/>and dissipation.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="potaw">Pottawatomies</orgName> are divided into three
                    <lb/>bands. viz. Pottawatomies of St. Josephs--Pottawatomies <lb/>of the Wabash,
                    and Pottawatomies of the Prairies.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="potaw">St. Joseph's</orgName> band formerly recieved some
                    instruc- <lb/>tion from the <orgName key="bapt">Baptist</orgName> missionaries
                    while they were <lb/>located on the <placeName key="stjos">St. Joseph's
                    </placeName>river. This band live <lb/>principally by cultivating the soil, and
                    what they <lb/><pb n="113ad" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_205"/>recieve from the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> by
                    way of annuities <lb/>They are poor and making very little advance- <lb/>ment in
                    civilization, they have no school nor <lb/>missionary. Some of them live in poor
                    log cabins, <lb/>others in wigwams; most of them keep cattle, horses <lb/>and
                    hogs: nearly all of them drink whiskey and <lb/>spend much of thier time in
                    idleness and dis- <lb/>sipation. They spend thier annuities soon <lb/>after
                    recieving them for whiskey and articles of <lb/>no real value to them.</p>
                <p>The manners, dress and general appearance of <lb/>these Indians do not materially
                    differ from those <lb/>small tribes located near them; they wear the
                    <lb/>blanket as the principal article of dress, and <lb/>hunt some on thier own
                    lands and in the adjoin- <lb/>ing State of <placeName key="missouri"
                        >Missouri</placeName>: but do not go on the long <lb/>hunt to the west.</p>
                <p>Our next visit was to the <orgName key="potaw">Wabash</orgName> Band, located
                    <lb/>about twelve miles from the gun Smith's.</p>
                <p>There are about six hundred of this Tribe, <lb/>comprizing about one third of the
                    nation, and are <lb/>principally settled in one neighborhood. They are
                    <lb/>completely under the control of the <orgName key="catholic"
                        >Catholics</orgName>, <lb/>and have three <orgName key="jesuit"
                        >Jesuit</orgName> Priests among them, who <lb/>are educating forty or fifty
                    Indian children-- <lb/>thier school is divided into two departments, <lb/>one
                    for boys and the other for girls. The one <lb/>for girls is said to be doing
                    some good; the oth- <lb/>er is in a languishing state.</p>
                <p>This band are building comfortable log hou- <lb/>ses, and cultivating the land;
                    keeping some cattle, <lb/>horses hogs &amp;c, but thier location is said to be
                    un- <lb/>healthy, and they are addicted to all the vices, <lb/>and immoral
                    practices common to the Indians; <lb/>and are fast wasting away--thier numbers
                    <lb/>have greatly diminished within the last few <lb/>years. The <orgName
                        key="potaw">Prairie</orgName> band is interspersed <lb/>amongst the other
                    two bands, and live much <lb/>after the same manner.</p>
                <p>The whiskey sellers and other traders practice <lb/>the same impositions upon
                    these Indians that <lb/>they do upon all the other Tribes within thier
                    <lb/>reach.</p>
                
                <p><orgName key="osage">Osage</orgName> Nation of Indians.</p>
                <p>Understanding that these Indians were out on <lb/>their fall hunt, and that we
                    should not have <lb/>an opportunity of seeing many of them; and <lb/>thier
                    principal village being distant about <lb/>forty miles from the <orgName
                        key="potaw">Pottawatomies</orgName>, we did not <lb/>visit them; but had an
                    opportunity of seeing a <lb/>few of the Tribe, and from good authority gath-
                    <lb/>ered the following account respecting them.</p>
                <p>This Tribe is located about one hundred <lb/>miles south of the <orgName
                        key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> Nation, bordering on the <lb/>State of
                        <placeName key="missouri">Missouri</placeName>. They once were very
                    numerous, <lb/>but at this time number only about Five Thou- <lb/>sand, and are
                    fast diminishing in consequence of <lb/>thier roving and intemperate habits.</p>
                <p>They are more like the wild Indians of <lb/>the <placeName key="rockm">Rocky
                        Mountains</placeName>, than any other Tribe on the <lb/>frontier. They are
                    great hunters of Buffalo, and <lb/>furs, and the fur traders depend more upon
                    them <lb/>for Buffalo Robes and furs, than upon any other <lb/>Tribe of the
                    south western frontier. This circum- <lb/>stance operates as one of the
                    principal causes of thier <lb/>small advancement in civilization.</p>
                <p>Much labour has been bestowed within Twenty <lb/>years, by the <orgName
                        key="presby">Presbyterian</orgName> Missionaries from New <lb/>York and
                    Boston, to improve their condition; but <lb/>it was attended with little
                    success; owing (as it <lb/>is said) to the prejudice of the Indians against
                    <lb/>the Missionary, from the influence of the fur <lb/>traders. This influence
                    remains to the present <lb/>day; and there appears to be no prospect of im-
                    <lb/>provement among them, while this state of things <lb/>exists.</p>
                <p>The traders discourage them from following ag- <lb/>ricultural pursuits, telling
                    them they do not want <lb/>to buy corn or cattle; but buffalo skins and furs--
                    <lb/>thus prompting them to keep up the chace.</p>
                <p>They also advise them not to have Schools <lb/>or any religious instruction
                    amongst them; hence <lb/>there are no schools or missionaries among <lb/>them at
                    this time.</p>
                <p>We were informed by apparent good <lb/>authority that the Indian Agents, combine
                    with <lb/><pb n="113af" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_206"/>the agents of the American Fur Company, and <lb/>control the
                    manner of paying out the annuities to <lb/>the Indians; by which the agents for
                    the Company <lb/>are enabled to monopolize the whole trade with <lb/>them. It
                    was said they first took all the <lb/>annuity money and deducted thier charges
                    against <lb/>the Indians; and for the balance gave to each <lb/>man as many
                    cents (with a particular mark on <lb/>them) as there were dollars due him;
                    promising <lb/>to pay him as many dollars in goods as he had <lb/>cents; thus
                    compelling te Indian to purchase <lb/>all his goods of them at an exorbitant
                    price.</p>
                <p>There was recently a large amount of <lb/>appropriation paid out to this Tribe,
                    in cattle <lb/>swine and agricultural implements: the In- <lb/>dians not being
                    acquainted with the use of them <lb/>soon sold and gave away all thier ploughs,
                    <lb/>killed the cattle and swine, and the whole <lb/>plan was frustrated.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="osage">Osages</orgName> are a statly race, the men <lb/>are
                    exceedingly large and tall, but the women <lb/>are short, and like the females
                    of the <orgName key="winne">Winnebagoe</orgName>
                    <lb/>Tribe appear dejected--they dress altogether like <lb/>the wild
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>After collecting the foregoing account <lb/>respecting the <orgName key="osage"
                        >Osages</orgName>, we travelled south towards <lb/>the <orgName
                        key="cherokee">Cherokee</orgName> nation; intending on our way to <lb/>pay a
                    visit to the United Tribe of the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca</orgName>
                    <lb/>and <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> Indians. We lodged with one
                        <persName key="jacks1">Jackson</persName>
                    <lb/>and half <gap/>. In the morning men to meet <lb/>us at his house; with whom
                    we held a council</p>
                <p>We gave them such advice as in our opinion <lb/>was needful. They appeared
                    perfectly friendly <lb/>and listened attentively to what was said to them</p>
                <p>We spoke to them through <persName key="jacks1">Jackson</persName> who in-
                    <lb/>terpreted for us. They made no reply to us as <lb/>there was no suitable
                    interpretor.</p>
                <p>We learned that the greater part of these <lb/>Indians were raising some corn and
                    domestic <lb/>animals, and have pretty comfortable log cabins, <lb/>&amp; some
                    fear of them are adopting the habits of <lb/>the whites in various
                    respects; such as laying aside <lb/>the blanket as an article of dress, putting
                    on pantaloons <lb/>instead of the leggings, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>They have no School amongst them, and none <lb/>of thier children are recieving
                    an education out of the <lb/>nation, excepting two of Jacksons'.</p>
                <p>The moral habits of the female part of this <lb/>Tribe were represented as
                    exceedingly gross and licen- <lb/>tious; and from all accounts they are fast
                    wasting away</p>
                <p>After visiting the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca</orgName>'s and <lb/><orgName
                        key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName>, we rode sixteen miles to the house of
                        <persName key="dadam1">Dan- <lb/>iel Adams</persName> a <orgName
                        key="mohawk"/>Mohawk Indian residing in the <orgName key="seneca"
                        >Seneca</orgName>
                    <lb/>nation. The tribe located in this place are <gap/>
                    <lb/>the <orgName key="sseneca">Sandusky Senecas</orgName>. This <persName
                        key="dadam1">Adams</persName> is a man <lb/>of tolerable education and
                    speaks and writes both the <lb/>English and Indian language; he is married to a
                    <lb/>Stockbridge woman, formerly from the State of <placeName key="newyo">New
                        <lb/>York</placeName>. She informed us that when a girl she spent <lb/>four
                    years on <persName key="longi">Long Island</persName>, where she was educated
                    <lb/>at a Friends School; she retains a grateful remem- <lb/>brance of the many
                    kindness that were shown her <lb/>by friends in those parts, the names of some
                    of whom <lb/>she mentioned--her appearance was greatly superiour <lb/>to any
                    Indian woman we saw while on our journey: <lb/>her whole conduct and
                    conversation were dignifi- <lb/>ed; she was easy in her manners and conversed
                    <lb/>understanding upon a variety of subjects, but more <lb/>especially upon
                    whatever related to her friends the <lb/>Indians of <placeName key="newyo">New
                        York State</placeName>. She manifested a deep <lb/>interest in the Treaty
                    lately made with the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca</orgName>
                    <lb/>Indians there. This woman and her husband <lb/>are both professors of the
                    Christian religion, and from <lb/>appearance were honestly engaged in the
                    discharge <lb/>of thier social, moral and religious duties: they <lb/>had a
                    family of three small children, who were <lb/>clothed in the style of the whites
                    and taught in the <lb/>english language altogether. They resided in <lb/>a good
                    timber house newly built and well fur- <lb/>nished--thier manner of living was
                    superior to the <lb/>generality of the whites in the west. They spoke
                    <lb/>freely of the lorn state and condition of thier peo- <lb/>ple, and of the
                    strong prejudices existing in thier <lb/>minds against the whites, and of the
                    difficulty of <lb/><pb n="113ah" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_207"/>overcoming these prejudices in conseguence of the ill
                    <lb/>treatment they had in too many instances recieved <lb/>from them. There is
                    at this time no school <lb/>nor religious institution in this Tribe.</p>
                <p>A few of them profess the Christian relig- <lb/>ion and have joined themselves to
                    some of the dif- <lb/>ferent religious sects, the greater part of them yet
                    <lb/>adhere to thier former views and superstitious <lb/>worship. Nearly all of
                    them are engaged in <lb/>agricultural pursuits in a small way, and keep va-
                    <lb/>rious kinds of domestic animals. We did not learn <lb/>that any of this
                    small Tribe keep sheep or manu- <lb/>facture cloth of any kind. Thier principal
                    food <lb/>is pork, and deer, wild fowl, corn bread, potatoes <lb/>and other
                    vegetables. Some of them have laid <lb/>aside the blanket as an article of
                    dress, but the <lb/>greater part attire themselves in the Indian style; <lb/>and
                    in no important particular differ from the <lb/>other Tribes that have been
                    removed from the <lb/>East. They are said to be very immoral in <lb/>thier
                    conduct among the neighboring whites; they <lb/>are unwilling to recieve white
                    men among them <lb/>as teachers, but would not object to having thier
                    <lb/>children instructed in english by persons of thier <lb/>own cast is those
                    suitably qualified could be pro- <lb/>cured. They are located upon a small tract
                    <lb/>of land west of the State of <placeName key="missouri"
                    >Missouri</placeName>, on the <placeName key="neosho">Ne- <lb/>osho
                        River</placeName> bordering on the <orgName key="cherokee"
                        >Cherokee</orgName> nation; and <lb/>numbered at the time of thier removal
                    Five <lb/>hundred and fifty one, but have since diminished</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokee</orgName> Indians.</p>
                <p>This Tribe is settled on lands laying west of <lb/>the State of <placeName
                        key="arkansas">Arkansaas</placeName>, bordering on the <placeName
                        key="arkan">Arkansas <lb/>River</placeName> and numbered about Twenty
                    Thousand souls, it is <lb/>thought they have diminished in number since thier
                    <lb/>removal west. The history of this nation is <lb/>generally known to the
                    public, therefore it may not <lb/>be expected to be so particular in our account
                    of <lb/>them. We entered upon the north east corner <lb/>or thier lands, and
                    travelled south to thier lands <lb/>bordering on the west line of <placeName
                        key="arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, are hilly <lb/>and well watered
                    and timbered, but not well adap- <lb/>ted to agriculture: in other parts it is
                    level and <lb/>fertile. The <orgName key="cherokee">Cherookees</orgName> live
                    principally by farming, <lb/>they raise neat cattle, horses and other domestic
                    <lb/>animals, and keep an abundance of poultry.</p>
                <p>Some of the Nation are extensive farmers and <lb/>planters; Cotton is grown in
                    the southern part of <lb/>the nation, where all who are able keep slaves to
                    <lb/>cultivate the land, and do the work in thier houses <lb/>&amp;. The manner
                    and customs of this portion of <lb/>thier community, as well as thier style of
                    dress and <lb/>mode of living does not differ materially from <lb/>the white
                    planters in the south west. A few of <lb/>the <orgName key="cherokee"
                        >Cherokees</orgName> are large slave holders.</p>
                <p>Thier laws for the government of thier slaves <lb/>are similar to those of the
                    Slave States. The slaves <lb/>frequently desert thier masters and run away.
                    <lb/>Some cotton and woolen goods are manufactured <lb/>for domestic use. We saw
                    a number of good <lb/>dwelling houses as we passed through thier country,
                    <lb/>but the most of them reside in small log cabins. <lb/>They have more
                    generally adopted the manners <lb/>of the whites than any other Tribe we have
                    met with <lb/>While passing along we frequently saw white <lb/>men who were
                    married to Indian women, and <lb/>in some instances an Indian man was connected
                    <lb/>by marriage to a white woman.</p>
                <p>There is less similarity in the general appearance <lb/>of the <orgName
                        key="cherokee">Cherokees</orgName> than in that of any other Tribe.
                    <lb/>They are divided into three distanct classes. First. <lb/>Those who are
                    pretty well civilized and appear <lb/>intelligent, Second, Those who may be
                    reckoned <lb/>among the half civilized or apprentices in civili- <lb/>zation.
                    Third, Those who have made but little <lb/>improvement in thier dress and
                    manners--this class <lb/>is much the most numerous. They are cultivators <lb/>of
                    the soil, and have generally given up hunting, <lb/>but are dissipated.</p>
                <p>They have a number of Missionaries and native <lb/>preachers amongst them; and
                    about Two Hundred <lb/>profess the Christian religion, and have joined them-
                    <lb/>selves either to the <orgName key="presby">Presbyterian</orgName>, <orgName
                        key="bapt">Baptist</orgName>, or <orgName key="metho">Methodist</orgName>
                    <lb/>Societies. They have thirteen schools in the Nation <lb/><pb n="113aj" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_208"/>where all the
                    children attending them are taught <lb/>in the english language. These Schools
                    are rep- <lb/>resented to be in a flourishing condition, and in <lb/>thier
                    general features are similar to our district <lb/>schools in New England. Many
                    of the <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokees</orgName>
                    <lb/>manifest an interest for the welfare of thier chil- <lb/>dren, and the
                    rising generation; and have recently <lb/>made very considerable appropriations
                    in order to <lb/>extend the benefits of education and civilization <lb/>amongst
                    them more generally. They have a <lb/>printing press in the nation where they
                    have thier <lb/>laws and public documents printed both in the English <lb/>and
                    Cherokee language.</p>
                <p>We arrived at the Council ground at a time <lb/>when thier National Council was
                    in session.</p>
                <p>The Government is divided into three departments <lb/>viz. executive,
                    legislative, and judicial. They <lb/>style the head of the Executive department
                    Principal <lb/>Chief, Thier legislative department is divided into <lb/>a
                    Committee and Council. The Judiciary is com- <lb/>posed of a supreme court, and
                    an inferior or Circuit <lb/>Court. <persName key="jrop1">John Rop</persName> is
                    now and has been for <lb/>many years Head Chief of the Nation.</p>
                <p>Thier Committee and Council consist of <lb/>fifteen members each, elected by the
                    people: all laws <lb/>are enacted by the Legislature and signed by the Princi-
                    <lb/>pal Chief. Thier Supreme Court is composed of five <lb/>judges. At the head
                    of this Court is <persName key="jbisk1">Jesse Biskey- <lb/>head</persName>, a
                    half blood Indian, and a <orgName key="bapt">Baptist</orgName> preacher</p>
                <p>We were introduced to all the members of the <lb/>several departments of
                    Government, where we had an <lb/>opportunity of witnessing thier manner of
                    transacting <lb/>business, which altho. simple and plain, was nev-
                    <lb/>ertheless very much to the point</p>
                <p>The whole nation (or at least as many as wi- <lb/>shed to assemble) were one day
                    while we were there collec- <lb/>ted together in order to hear the annual
                    message of <lb/>thier Principal Chief, and likewise the Report <lb/>of the
                    delegation who were sent to <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>
                    <lb/>the last winter to transact some business with the <lb/><orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName>; which Report embraced all their <lb/>correspondence
                    with the President and Secretary <lb/>of War. This Message and Report were drawn
                    up <lb/>with ability.</p>
                <p>We witnessed nothing like a spirit of <lb/>hostility on the part of these Indians
                    towards the <lb/><orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> of the United States;
                    and yet they have <lb/>not forgotten the wrongs that have been practiced
                    <lb/>upon them by the whites. It affords them some <lb/>relief when they can
                    meet with persons who are <lb/>willing to lend a listening ear to the sad tale
                    of <lb/>those sufferings and miseries caused by the State <lb/>of <placeName
                        key="georg">Georgia</placeName>, as well as the Agents and officers of the
                        <lb/><orgName key="usag">General Government</orgName>. By accounts from
                    persons <lb/>of unimpeachable veracity, those who were eye <lb/>witness of some
                    of the horrid scenes, we were led to think <lb/>that the half had never met the
                    public eye</p>
                <p>They treated us with kindness and much <lb/>attention while we were in the
                    Nation, and altho. <lb/>they have not had much acquaintance with mem- <lb/>bers
                    of our religious society until recently; yet <lb/>they looked upon them as thier
                    friends, and spoke <lb/>with grateful hearts of the benevolent and Chris-
                    <lb/>tian interposition of Friends in a great many <lb/>instances on behalf of
                    the red man.</p>
                <p>Much might be said respecting the advance- <lb/>ment of this Tribe in
                    civilization &amp;c; but we <lb/>will conclude by saying that our hearts were
                    <lb/>made to feel deeply for them, and to put up <lb/>our feeble petitions to
                    the Father of all our sure <lb/>mercies, that He might yet smile upon this
                    strip- <lb/>ped and pealed people, and awaken them under <lb/>a sense of the
                    mercies extended to themselves to <lb/>a feeling of thier own obligation to deal
                    justly, and <lb/>show mercy, and kindness to those poor descend- <lb/>ants of
                    the African race who are held in bon- <lb/>dage among them.</p>
                <p>A band of the <orgName key="seminole">Seminole</orgName> Indians <lb/>(lately
                    from Florida) were temporarily settled upon <lb/>the <orgName key="cherokee"
                        >Cherokee</orgName>'s land near by the Council ground, <lb/>at the head of
                    which, were two Chiefs by the <lb/>names of <persName key="wildc1">Wild
                        Cat</persName>, and <persName key="allig1">Alligator</persName>, who were
                    <lb/>noted men in the late Florida War. We held <lb/>two Councils with these
                    Chiefs, at one of which <lb/>came about Twenty of their principal men;
                        <lb/><persName key="wildc1">Wild Cat</persName> and <persName key="allig1"
                            >Alligator</persName> made many bitter <lb/><pb n="113al" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_209"/>complaints of the ill
                    treatment of the white men, both <lb/>before and since their removal. We feared
                    there <lb/>might be an outbreak by <persName key="wildc1">Wild Cat</persName>
                    and his party, in <lb/>thier present excited state. It was expecting that the
                    <lb/>Agents would soon remove them from the Cherokee coun- <lb/>try to lands
                    provided for them the <orgName key="usag">General Govern- <lb/>ment</orgName> in
                    the <orgName key="creek">Creek</orgName> nation; at which <persName key="wildc1"
                        >Wild Cat</persName> and <lb/><persName key="allig1">Alligator</persName>
                    appeared much offended. We conversed <lb/>with several of the Agents and
                    officers, and desired <lb/>them to consider thier peculiar dispositions, and
                    <lb/>use all conciliatory measures in the removal of <lb/>these unhappy and
                    unfortunate beings.</p>
                <p>We also endeavoured to persuade these <orgName key="seminole">Seminoles</orgName>
                    <lb/>to live peaceably with thier neighbors, and to break <lb/>off from thier
                    old habits and become farmers, like <lb/>the <orgName key="cherokee"
                        >Cherokees</orgName> and other Indians around them.</p>
                <p>They are much given to drunkenness, stealing <lb/>and other vices, and live like
                    the wild Indians.</p>
                <p>They formerly belonged to the <orgName key="creek">Creek</orgName> Nation,
                    <lb/>and now speak the same language. Some of <lb/>them hold slaves who serve
                    for interpretors and <lb/>sevants to them.</p>
                <p>We next visited the <orgName key="creek">Creek</orgName> Na- <lb/>tion. They are
                    situated south of the <orgName key="cherokee">Chero- <lb/>kees</orgName>, on
                    lands bordering on the <placeName key="verdi">Verdigris River</placeName>, and
                    <lb/>number about Fifteen Thousand Indians, and <lb/>Three or Four Thousand
                    Slaves. We had an in- <lb/>terview with <persName key="bmars1">Benjamin
                        Marshall</persName>, a Native <lb/>and very intelligent man, and one of the
                    most <lb/>wealthy and influential in the Nation.</p>
                <p>He informed us that every family of the <lb/><orgName key="creek">Creek</orgName>
                    nation would raise enough produce the present season to supply <lb/>thier wants
                    throughout the year; they are fast <lb/>improving in agriculture and domestic
                    manu- <lb/>facures, and in thier manner of living. They <lb/>expect soon to
                    manufacture all thier own clothing <lb/>--many of them live in comfortable
                    houses and <lb/>dress like white people, but others still wear <lb/>the blanket
                    and are much given to dissipation</p>
                <p>They have a late become anxious that <lb/>thier children should be educated,
                    provided it <lb/>could be done in thier own nation, but are <lb/>generally
                    averse to sending them abroad for <lb/>this purpose. They have made
                    application to <lb/>our <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName> for thier
                    school fund to be ap- <lb/>propriated to education in thier nation, instead of
                    <lb/>its being spent at the <orgName key="choctaw">Chactaw</orgName> Accademy as
                    hereto- <lb/>fore. They have at this time but one school, and <lb/>that is
                    continued throughout the year. They have <lb/>recently passed severe laws to
                    prohibit the vending <lb/>of ardent spirits among them; which took effect
                    <lb/>about six months ago, and those who had been <lb/>opposed to the law have
                    seen the good effects of <lb/>it and become satisfied.</p>
                <p>Many of the slaves and Indians appear <lb/>sober and religious--some of the
                    slaves are approved <lb/>preachers, and hold meeting regularly on first days;
                    <lb/>We attended one of these meetings, which was <lb/>conducted in a moderate
                    and becoming manner. <lb/>It was composed of Indians, slaves and thier
                    <lb/>masters. Thier minister was an uneducated slave: <lb/>all seemed interested
                    in thier meeting, and several <lb/>much effected, even unto tears.</p>
                <p>A slaveholder told us he was willing his <lb/>slaves should go to these meetings,
                    for it made <lb/>them better men and women.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="creek">Creeks</orgName> have long been slave holders, <lb/>and
                    appear insensible on the subject of this <lb/>great evil. Thier laws respecting
                    thier slaves <lb/>and the Government of thier Tribe are similar to <lb/>those of
                    the <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokees</orgName> and <orgName key="choctaw"
                        >Choctaws</orgName>.</p>
                <p>Thier Country is good for agriculture, will <lb/>watered and timbered, and we
                    believe this Nation <lb/>would soon become a prosperous and flourishing
                    <lb/>people, were it not for the injustice and de- <lb/>structive influence of
                    slavery within and around <lb/>thier borders.</p>
                <p>A few days previous to our arriving <lb/>there, about Five hundred slaves ran
                    away from <lb/>thier masters. They belonged in the <orgName key="creek"
                        >Creek</orgName> and <lb/><orgName key="cherokee">Cherokee</orgName>
                    nations; this caused much excitement <lb/>and a posse was sent after them from
                    both <lb/>nations. Both Church and State seemed <lb/>aroused on account of these
                    desertions, and ready <lb/>to make every possible effort to recover them <lb/>at
                    all hazards; and in future to enact more <lb/><pb n="113an" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_210"/>stringent laws for the
                    government of thier slaves, <lb/>and for binding thier Chains more strongly upon
                    <lb/>them.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="choctaw">Choctaw</orgName> Indians. <lb/>fifth day of the week
                    and <date when="1842-12-01">first of Twelfth <lb/>month 1842</date>.</p>
                <p>After having finished our visit <lb/>to the <orgName key="cherokee"
                        >Cherookees</orgName>, <orgName key="creek">Creeks</orgName>, and <orgName
                        key="seminole">Seminoles</orgName>, we <lb/>hired a private conveyance to
                        <placeName key="fsmith">Fort Smith</placeName>, on <lb/>the border of the
                        <orgName key="choctaw">Choctaw</orgName> nation. We there <lb/>took horses
                    and rode fifteen miles to the Choctaw <lb/>Agency and put up at a Tavern kept by
                    an <lb/>Indian woman. In the evening we had some <lb/>conversation with a young
                    Indian who had been <lb/>educated at the Choctaw accademy in <placeName
                        key="kentu">Kentucky</placeName>; he <lb/>was not very <lb/>flattering. We
                    learned while in the <lb/>Nation that at the Council lately held on
                        <lb/><placeName key="redriv">Red River</placeName>, the Choctaws resolved
                    not to have <lb/>anything more to do with that school.</p>
                <p>Their annual Council was in Session <lb/>near the <placeName key="redriv">Red
                        River </placeName>where the greater part of <lb/>the <orgName key="choctaw"
                        >Choctaws</orgName> reside.</p>
                <p>Many of the Indians near <placeName key="redriv">Red River</placeName> are
                    <lb/>said to live well, they keep slaves, and raise <lb/>Cotton for thier own
                    consumption, and for mar- <lb/>ket, they also raise corn, wheat, potatoes and
                    <lb/>other vegetables, and keep large stocks of neat <lb/>cattle, horses and
                    swine, and a few of them <lb/>have sheep, and make some cotton and woolen
                    <lb/>goods for thier slaves and for themselves.</p>
                <p>They have in general comfortable log houses <lb/>and live like the new settlers
                    in the west.</p>
                <p>They have six or eight schools in the nation, <lb/>where the primary branches of
                    an english education <lb/>are taught; there are however but a small por-
                    <lb/>tion of the <orgName key="choctaw">Choctaw</orgName> Children who are
                    recieving <lb/>and education at schools, either in or out of the
                    <lb/>nation.</p>
                <p>We were informed that the Council <lb/>now in Session, have resolved to establish
                    two <lb/>manual labour schools on an extensive plan. <lb/>One them is to be
                    located on <placeName key="redriv">Red River</placeName>, <lb/>and the other at
                        <placeName key="fcoff">Fort Coffee</placeName> on <placeName key="arkan"
                        >Arkansas <lb/>River</placeName>; and one important feature in the <lb/>plan
                    about to be adopted by them is, that <lb/>the female children of the nation, are
                    to be <lb/>educated at a place several miles distant from <lb/>where the males
                    are educated.</p>
                <p>They have appropriated Eighteen Thousand <lb/>Dollars towards the support of
                    these schools.</p>
                <p>It was reported that the Methodists were <lb/>expecting to have the control of
                    the one at <placeName key="fcoff">Fort <lb/>Coffee.</placeName></p>
                <p>We visited one of thier primary schools <lb/>taught by a man from South Carolina,
                    which <lb/>consisted of about Twenty Scholars. We were <lb/>pleased with the
                    appearance of it, and thought <lb/>the teacher was doing well for the
                    scholars.</p>
                <p>He informed us that he had been engaged <lb/>in this school since <date
                        when="1838">1838</date>. and had a salary of <lb/>Eight hundred and fifty
                    Dollars per annum.</p>
                <p>The Country owned by the Choctaws <lb/>extends from the <placeName key="arkan"
                        >Arkansas</placeName> to the <placeName key="redriv">Red River</placeName>,
                    and <lb/>is generally fertile and well adapted to the grow- <lb/>th of cotton,
                    corn, wheat, and potatoes.</p>
                <p>Some of the Indians have embraced Chris- <lb/>tianity, but the greater part of
                    them still ad- <lb/>here to thier old traditions. Some have become
                    <lb/>temparate, but dissipation, idleness, and thier kin- <lb/>dred views are
                    very prevalent amongst most of <lb/>them.</p>
                <p>The Government and Civil policy of <lb/>this Nation are similar to that of the
                        <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokees</orgName>
                    <lb/>heretofore discribed. We saw a few of the <lb/><orgName key="chick"
                        >Chickasaws</orgName>, but ascertaining that there was no <lb/>material
                    difference between these Indians and <lb/>the <orgName key="choctaw"
                        >Choctaws</orgName>, we did not consider ti important <lb/>for us to make a
                    special visit to them.</p>
                <p>They are settled on the <orgName key="choctaw">Choctaws</orgName> land, and
                    <lb/>speak the same language, and intermarry with <lb/>them.</p>

                <p>General Remarks.</p>
                <p>After having spent several months in <lb/>travelling among the Indians located on
                    our <lb/>western frontier; and having used our ut- <lb/>most endeavours to
                    gather such facts and <lb/>information as we apprehended might be <lb/>useful or
                    interesting to our Society and the <lb/>Community at large; we deem it right for
                    <lb/>us to submit points; for the future con- <lb/>sideration and action of the
                    Society of Friends <lb/>on behalf of the Aborigines of our land.</p>
                <p>During our visit among the Indians <lb/>many circumstances were apparent, which
                    in our <lb/>opinion tended to prevent thier advancement <lb/>in civilization and
                    otherways.</p>
                <p>We are aware that much labour and prop- <lb/>erty is expended yearly on thier
                    behalf, and yet <lb/>it is sad to relate that these poor benighted and
                    <lb/>almost friendless beings are daily diminishing in <lb/>numbers, and sinking
                    deeper and deeper in misery <lb/>and woe.</p>
                <p>There are but few to look into thier <lb/>wants, or to raise a voice against the
                    mal-practices <lb/>of the numerous unprincipaled white men who <lb/>infest thier
                    country in order to obtain the mon- <lb/>ey annually paid to them; <del/> and
                    <lb/>at the same time are practising the most degra- <lb/>ding and immoral
                    conduct.</p>
                <p>If the hand of the destroyer is not spee- <lb/>dily staid, in all human
                    probability it will be but <lb/>a few years before this once numerous race will
                    <lb/>be numbered with the nations are not.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the Tribes are decreasing yearly, <lb/>and some of them at the rapid
                    rate of from tw- <lb/>elve to twenty per cent.</p>
                <p>The present condition of the elder part <lb/>of the uncivilized Tribes is such
                    (having long been <lb/>a prey to the unprincipaled white men,) that we <lb/>can
                    not look for much change for the better <lb/>in many of them--yet in beholding
                    the younger <lb/>men and women, and the little children, who all <lb/>appeared
                    endowed with talents for improvement <lb/>equal to the whites, we were
                    encouraged to look <lb/>forward with a hope of better days, for this poor
                    <lb/>unfortunate and almost friendless people, if the <lb/>christian community
                    should without delay use <lb/>thier influence to remove the prominent obstacles
                    <lb/>now in the way of thier civilization.</p>
                <p>First, we would remark that the Indians <lb/>who have been removed from the east
                    to the west <lb/>side of the <geogName key="missi">Mississippi River</geogName>
                    appear to be in an <lb/>unsettled state, and entertain fears of being again
                    <lb/>removed. They say they have no guarantee from <lb/><orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName>, that they shall remain on these lands <lb/>any longer
                    time than it may suit the convinience <lb/>of the whites; and some of them are
                    desirous that <lb/>friends should use thier influence to have thier <lb/>lands
                    secured to them, in fee simple for ever; that <lb/>thier fears on this account
                    may be quieted, and <lb/>they encouraged to lay up something for themselves
                    <lb/>and thier children.</p>
                <p>Secondly--Nearly all the Tribes have annuities <lb/>paid them in goods or money,
                    quite sufficient in <lb/>most cases to make them comforable during the
                    <lb/>year, if rightly applied. Each Tribe recieves all <lb/>thier money at one
                    payment, and this money passes <lb/>from them in the course of a few days; and
                    in <lb/>nearly every instance the poor ignorant Indian has <lb/>nothing of value
                    to show for it, but is in fact <lb/>made more miserable on account of it</p>
                <p>We would suggest to the Committee that it <lb/>may be proper for our Society to
                    use thier influ- <lb/>ence, in endeavouring to bring about a change <lb/>in the
                    manner in which these payments are <lb/>made, so as to place thier money if
                    possible, out <lb/>of the reach of whiskey sellers, licensed traders and
                    <lb/>agents of the Fur companies.</p>
                <p>We are aware, that to effect such a change <lb/>would be attended with much
                    diffuculty; but the good <lb/>that would arise to the Indians would warrant
                    friends <lb/>in making some sacrifice, to effect so desirable an
                    <lb/>object.</p>
                <p>The Indians in thier present state are very <lb/>improvident; and in most cases
                    incapable of <lb/>managing thier affairs, and expending thier money <lb/>to
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>We would not hold out to the world, that <lb/>they are recieving more than thier
                    due, but in <lb/>as much as the <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>
                    consider them as <lb/>thier wards, they should extend thier guardianship <lb/>a
                    little further, and not leave them so much exposed <lb/>to the avaricious
                    unprincipled traders.</p>
                <p>The Indians in general are not governed by <lb/>by moral or religious principles,
                    and every means is <lb/>used to place before them such things as will entice
                    <lb/>thier appetites and passions; and having but little <lb/>to restrain them,
                    they are immediately drawn into <lb/>temptation; and the work of destruction
                    goes on, <lb/>while they are possessed of anything that is valuable, <lb/>or
                    have any credit left.</p>
                <p>We believe it may be proper for Friends <lb/>to urge upon our <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName> the necessity of adopting <lb/>more effectual measures
                    to prevent this work of <lb/>destruction against this deeply aggrieved and
                    injured <lb/>people; for however well disposed <orgName key="usag"
                        >Government</orgName> may <lb/>be in paying them large annuities; it is in
                    our <lb/>view an undeniable fact, that the Indians are <lb/>made more miserable
                    by any dollar of annuity <lb/>money paid them--and that if this money must con-
                    <lb/>tinue to be thus wasted, it would be far better to <lb/>have it paid
                    directly to the whiskey dealers and traders; <lb/>and an incalculable amount of
                    misery would be sa- <lb/>ved to the Indians by such a change.</p>
                <p>Another source of immorality and misery is <lb/>thier near location to the
                    Military posts.</p>
                <p>While the ostensible object of these fortifica- <lb/>tions is to guard the
                    Indians on the frontier, from <lb/>being harmed by the wild Tribes, and to
                    prevent <lb/>hostilities between them and the frontier settlers, <lb/>the
                    licentiousness practiced by the soldiery and the <lb/>female Indians in every
                    Tribe, is too gross to be <lb/>mentioned; the effect of which is to destroy the
                    <lb/>morals of many of the whites, and to entail wretch- <lb/>edness, misery and
                    death upon thousands of the <lb/>Indians.</p>
                <p>In regard to thier farming operations, we <lb/>would remark; that the manner in
                    which <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>
                    <lb/>expends the Indian appropriations for agriculture is <lb/>to prepare
                    and carry on a farm at a suitable <lb/>place on the land owned by the Tribe, as
                    a pat- <lb/>tern or sample farm--this manner of farming <lb/>is attended with
                    considerable expence, and in most <lb/>cases, of little apparent adbantage to
                    the Indians, <lb/>they being more like children, who cannot <lb/>set themselves
                    to work, but might be assisted <lb/>in carrying it on; if they had for a few
                    <lb/>years suitable instructors, not only to show, but <lb/>also to help them do
                    the work.</p>
                <p>Therefore we thought, to warrant success, <lb/>it would be important to employ
                    persons, to <lb/>give daily attention, and assist each Indian <lb/>in the
                    management of his own particular lot.</p>
                <p>One man could assist twenty or more persons, <lb/>and it would be desirable that
                    some of these <lb/>men should have wives with them, who should <lb/>be employed
                    to instruct the women in the <lb/>various branches of housewifery, for we think
                    <lb/>much more may be expected, from the im- <lb/>provement of the women than
                    the men; the <lb/>women being more associated with the chil- <lb/>dren, and much
                    better acquainted with habits <lb/>of industry. This mode of instruction would
                    <lb/>not be attended with much more expense, than <lb/>the pattern farm system,
                    and would promise <lb/>better success.</p>
                <p>Those Indians who live in wigwams are <lb/>much inclined to rove, and it is not
                    uncommon for them <lb/>to remove several times during the summer--on this
                    account <lb/>it seemed very important that they should be encouraged <lb/>to
                    abandon the wigwam altogether, and to live in houses, <lb/>and to have private
                    lots attached well enclosed, so that <lb/>an individual interest might be
                    excited, instead of <lb/>having things in common as they now do; for unless
                    <lb/>such an interest can be raise among them, it will be <lb/>very difficult to
                    make much improvement in many of <lb/>the Tribes.</p>
                <p>We would also give a few hints upon <lb/>education. The Indians being so
                    prejudiced aga- <lb/>inst the white people, are very much averse to <lb/>thier
                    children being educated <del/> by them, either <lb/>in or out of thier own
                    nation; and boys who <lb/><pb n="113at" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_213"/>have been educated abroad, are treated with much
                    <lb/>neglect when they return home; and these having <lb/>into favour with thier
                    Tribe, return to the hab- <lb/>its and practices of uncivilized Indians.</p>
                <p>We regretted that there were no educated <lb/>Indians employed as teachers or
                    assistants, in any <lb/>of the Tribes, white people supplying such <lb/>places
                    entirely. But we believe that much <lb/>advantage might arise in many respects,
                    both <lb/>to parents and children, by encouraging native <lb/>teachers and
                    assistants; and we would suggest <lb/>that special care be taken to bring about
                    <lb/>so desirable an object.</p>
                <p>Having completed the foregoing <lb/>statement of facts, from extended notes taken
                    <lb/>during the course of our journey, which oc- <lb/>cupied us from the latter

                    circumstances would well admit of, and the family and Indian children enjoying
                    <lb/>good health generally. The School consisted of 24 children, 12 boys and 12
                    girls, to-wit: 7 <orgName key="shawnee">Shaw- <lb/>nees,</orgName> 10 <orgName

                    <lb/>Indian, and 3 white children of the family—27 in all. The general order of
                    the family and school <lb/>was good—as good perhaps as we might expect to find
                    in any family of nearly 40 persons. All of <lb/>the Indian children can now
                    speak English, excepting five, who had been recently admitted. They <lb/>all
                    appear to be making good progress in learning under the efficient management and
                    instruction <lb/>of their present teacher. We were highly gratified, in
                    particular, with their recitations in Geogra- <lb/>phy, and their answers in
                    Scripture. They are nearly all orphans, having either no parents, or only
                    <lb/>one parent living. About 20 other children had lately been offered to the
                    Superintendent by the <lb/><orgName key="odawa">Ottowas</orgName>, whom he had
                    postponed receiving on account of the low state of his means to sustain the
                    <lb/>expences.</p>
                <p>The Farm consists of 320 acres of first rate land; of this, about 100 acres are
                    in corn, 40 in wheat, <lb/>25 in oats, 25 in meadow, 5 rented out, 10 about the
                    buildings, and the rest, about 115 acres not broken, <lb/>and the greater part
                    in shrub-woods. The crops all looked well—except that the cultivation of the
                    <lb/>corn was behind hand—the season having been very favorable; but we believed
                    that the Superinten- <lb/>dent was overcharged with cares, in proportion to his
                    means, and feared that part of the crop might <lb/>suffer for want of attention.
                    We have since understood that this has been the case, partly on ac- <lb/>count
                    of protracted wet weather.</p>
                <p>It will be observed, that so far as the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName>
                    are concerned, the school is nearly a failure, as <lb/>only 7 of their children
                    out of 200 to 250 belonging to that tribe, are now receiving its benefits. We
                    <lb/>believe this decline, as to them, is owing to several causes. One probably
                    is, the unsettlement in the <lb/>minds of the tribe. Most of them are farmers,
                    and they are located upon a district of land, not ex- <lb/>celled probably by
                    any other in <placeName key="kansas">Kansas</placeName>, and having few equals
                    even in the rich valleys of the West. <lb/>But their annuities, which have been
                    paid them for some years by our <orgName key="usag">government</orgName>,
                    instead of excit- <lb/>ing them to industry, economy, and spirited improvement,
                    would appear to have had a contrary effect, <lb/>by enabling them to live in
                    indolence, and contract habits of vice and drunkenness, leading to de-
                    <lb/>generacy: also to cause them to be infested with a class of rapacious
                    whites, whose example and in- <lb/><pb n="115b" facs="NYYM_scrapbook_215"/>fluence are deleterious in a high
                    degree. There are some <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName>, however, who
                    are exceptions <lb/>to this, who are moral and temperate; and are well off as to
                    property: but there is a general rest- <lb/>lessness among them, owing to the
                    above cause, and to their aversion to becoming subject to the <lb/>State laws,
                    and hence a disposition to sell their lands, and remove to the southern border
                        of<placeName key="kansas">Kansas</placeName> , <lb/>where they can again be
                    more exclusively to themselves.</p>
                <p>Another reason is, there are some district day schools organized, so that some
                    who desire to do <lb/>so, can and do send their children to those schools; and
                    thus they are able to give their children <lb/>some education without parting
                    with them from their families. They are reputed to be indulgent, <lb/>and to be
                    sensitive as to the treatment which their children must sometimes receive in the
                    Boarding <lb/>Schools in order to subject them to the required discipline.</p>
                <p>Another, and perhaps the greatest on their part, it the natural carelessness
                    usually prevailing <lb/>in ignorant and uncivilized communities as to education
                    itself. Few of them, therefore, take much <lb/>interest in the schools.</p>
                <p>To the foregoing may be added, on our part, 1. A lack of sufficient funds to
                    prosecute the <lb/>concern to the best advantage; 2. Overtaxing those we employ
                    with more services than they are <lb/>able to perform to profit; 3. Too frequent
                    changes in Superintendents and Teachers (for these <lb/>should be devoted
                    persons of much Christian endurance and patience, who can remain in their posi-
                    <lb/>tions for years together); and, 4. A want of that Missionary spirit and
                    those Christian gifts <lb/>which are necessary to success, in the
                    Superintendent, Teachers and others employed in the <lb/>concern.</p>
                <p>If the foregoing views needed confirmation, examples in point are within
                    observation. A large <lb/>establishment, munificently supplied with income, and
                    every appurtenance (so far as it appears), which <lb/>could well be desired, as
                    to buildings, etc.—enjoying the favor and patronage of the <orgName key="usag"
                        >government</orgName>, <lb/>and of proportions sufficient to educate all the
                        <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnee</orgName> children of the tribe, languishes,
                    with a bare <lb/>existence as to a school, nearly to a failure, with very little
                    usefulness, for the same reasons above <lb/>mentioned, and perhaps others in
                    addition. While another establishment, which having not suffered <lb/>for want
                    of sufficient means, but which has had one persevering and devoted
                    Superintendent for 24 <lb/>years, has in it more than 60 students of the tribe
                    in which it is located, and is in prosperous and <lb/>profitable progress.</p>
                <p>We give it as the judgment of the Committee, that the success of an Institution
                    of this kind de- <lb/>pends, under Providence, upon the employment of well
                    qualified Superintendents and Teachers, who <lb/>will remain with some degree of
                    permanence, in the work, and give their hearts conscientiously to it; <lb/>and
                    that such qualification and devotedness are indispensable.</p>
                <p>It now appears probable, that the title, in fee-simple, to the land upon which
                    our Institution is lo- <lb/>cated, will be obtained by treaty before very long,
                    as the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName> have given their consent, and
                    <lb/>the present administration in our <orgName key="usag">government</orgName>,
                    will probably favor it; if, however, this shall fail, the <lb/>premises may be
                    obtained by purchase, under the treaty of <date when="1854">1854</date>, if
                    rightly attended to. But if this <lb/>shall not be the result, and if the
                    premises pass out of our possession, we would favor employing the <lb/>proceeds
                    of the value of the improvements to the purchase of other property in some
                    suitable loca- <lb/>tion for a Boarding School for Indian children without
                    distinction of tribe: for we believe that the <lb/>hearts of Friends are warm in
                    this work of benevolence and labor of love, and that they will contri- <lb/>bute
                    for its support and continuance, if they can be satisfied that their
                    contributions and their labors <lb/>are efficient and profitable. But we believe
                    the prospect of extensive benefit to the <orgName key="shawnee"
                        >Shawnees</orgName> exclu- <lb/>sively, is not sufficiently encouraging, for
                    the future, to justify the labor, care and expenditure, which <lb/>are
                    indispensible to such an establishment. Much good has been done to the <orgName
                        key="shawnee">Shawnees</orgName>, as a tribe, <lb/>since our Society first
                    commenced their labors with them—a fact which they freely, and many of <lb/>them
                    gratefully acknowledge—but the state of things is now so changed, that a change
                    in our course <lb/>of proceeding is called for.</p>
                

                <p>We unhesitatingly believe, that a well conducted Indian Boarding School, for the
                    benefit of the <lb/>half-civilized and wild tribes of the West, from whom we
                    might wish to receive children to educate, <lb/>under the management of
                    Christian officers of adequate ability and permanence as aforesaid, with an
                    <lb/>ample appropriation of means, might and would be sufficiently patronized
                    by; the Indians that its <lb/>success, under Providence, would be certain; and
                    that its advantages to them would be inestimable. <lb/>Without the requisites
                    above named, such an Institution would be a failure. A large proportion—
                    <lb/>perhaps nearly all of the children sent to such an Institution would be
                    orphans; but this would not <lb/>in the least militate against the work—on the
                    contrary, it would be desirable, for such children re- <lb/>main with fewer
                    interruptions of absence, and for a longer time in the Institution. And above
                    all, <lb/>it should be the united effort, uppermost in the mind, that while we
                    labor to instruct them in litera- <lb/>ture, agriculture, housewifery, moral
                    discipline, and the arts of civilized life, their religious instruc- <lb/>tion
                    in the principles, precepts, and doctrines of Christianity should be carefully
                    attended to. We <lb/>would heartily commend the modification of the present, of
                    the establishment of a new Institution <lb/>of the character here designated, to
                    the solid and weighty consideration of the Yearly Meeting. <lb/>To accomplish
                    anything valuable, requires a mind disposed to act, a willingness to be made
                    useful under <lb/>Divine influence, in promoting the welfare and happiness of
                    our fellow men, with our labor and <lb/>means, and with those abilities, which
                    are given to us for a good end; and when these are guided <lb/>by prudence,
                    discretion, and a prayerful spirit, leaning with an humble reliance for help, of
                    the arm <lb/>of Divine Power and Goodness, there is every reason to believe that
                    His favor and blessing will be <lb/>granted, when thus engaged under His
                    sanction.</p>
                <p>In the management of such an Institution, the Book Accounts of the establishment
                    should be <lb/>kept full, clear and explicit, and if the Institution be under
                    the care of a Committee, a clear quar- <lb/>terly statement of account-current
                    should be laid before them; and no one should be entrusted with <lb/>the
                    management of the finances and affairs of such a concern who is incapable of
                    keeping such book <lb/>accounts accurately and explicitly, nor any one who does
                    not manage his own affairs successfully <lb/>and economically.</p>
                <p>We also think the Committee should hold their meetings frequently at the
                    establishment; the <lb/>advantages of which are too obvious to require comment.
                    And inasmuch as many valuable Friends <lb/>are now settled in <placeName
                        key="kansas">Kansas</placeName>, with a prospect of more, we propose that
                    the Committee which is now <lb/>standing be dissolved, either the present year
                    or at no very distant date; and that a new one be <lb/>appointed, most of whom
                    shall be residents of <placeName key="kansas">Kansas</placeName>: and that they
                    meet quarterly, and at the <lb/>premises of the school at least twice in the
                    year. Also, that one or two Friends be appointed as <lb/>correspondents with the
                    Committee for each Quarterly Meeting, and residing in the limits thereof,
                    <lb/>and that they and the Committee hold an annual meeting together at
                        <placeName key="whitew">Whitewater</placeName>, at the time of the
                    <lb/>Yearly Meeting, and make a united annual Report, showing the expenses for
                    the year, and the gen- <lb/>eral finances in a condensed account-current, also
                    the number of students, and a careful summary <lb/>of their progress and general
                    condition.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we wish to say that, in the foregoing remarks and statements,
                    there is no inten- <lb/>tion to cast reflection upon any one who is now, or who
                    has heretofore been, connected with the <lb/>establishment; but to give
                    candidly, as appears to be our duty, our views and convictions relative
                    <lb/>thereto.</p>

                    such <lb/>suggestions as may appear to them desirable. The Bill was accordingly
                    read, and referred to a Committee of six for examination <lb/>and report.</p>
                <p>The attention of the conference was called to the Report of the Joint Special
                    Committee of <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName> and that of the Indian
                    <lb/>Peace Commissioners and other documents relating to the condition and
                    treatment of the Indians; and after discussing this subject, <lb/>it was decided
                    to address a memorial to <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName> to urge that
                    sufficient provision be made to insure justice and protection to the <lb/>
                    Indians, and for their civilization. A Committee of seven was accordingly
                    appointed to draft an essay, and present it to a future <lb/>session. The
                    conference then adjourned to 8 o’clock, P.M., at which time it met.</p>
                <p>The Committee appointed to examine the bill of the Senator from <placeName
                        key="kansas">Kansas</placeName> to create a department of Indian affairs,
                    reported <lb/>that its provisions were generally approved, but that some parts
                    of it appeared to require modification. The several clauses were <lb/>then read,
                    and the Committee was requested to inform <persName key="pome1">Senator
                        POMEROY</persName> of our views in accordance with his request.</p>
                <p>The Committee on the memorial presented an essay, which was read and referred
                    back for amendment. The conference <lb/>then adjourned to half-past 9 o’clock on
                    the 21st instant.</p>
                <p><date when="1869-01-21">1st mo., 21st.</date> Conference assembled. The Committee
                    presented a draft of memorial to <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName>, which
                    was read, and after <lb/>revision, adopted, and a committee was appointed to
                    have 750 copies printed for presentation to <orgName key="uscong"
                        >Congress</orgName> and for distribution in <lb/>our meetings.</p>
                <p>It was then proposed, and after careful consideration, agreed, that an address to
                    our fellow-citizens should be prepared, <lb/>setting forth the treatment and
                    condition of the Indians, and our indibidual responsibility in reference to it,
                    and to this service a <lb/>committee of six was appointed.</p>
                <p>In order to allow time for members of the conference to proceed to <placeName
                        key="wash">Washington</placeName>, to urge upon members of <orgName
                        key="uscong">Congress</orgName> this sub- <lb/>ject of our concern, the
                    convention adjourned to the evening of 7th day, <date when="1869-01-23"
                        >23rd</date>, when it again convened. The Friends who had been <lb/>to
                        <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>, reported that they were kindly
                    received by several Members of <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName> and
                    others interested in the objects of our <lb/>meeting, and that arrangements had
                    been made for an interview with the Committees of both houses of <orgName
                        key="uscong">Congress</orgName> on Indian affairs <lb/>in a joint meeting
                    for that purpose; and also for a meeting with <persName key="ggran1">General
                        GRANT</persName>, to take place on the <date when="1869-01-25">25th
                        Instant</date>.</p>
                <p>The Committee on the public address presented an essay which, upon a subsequent
                    meeting was agreed upon, and referred <lb/>for completion and publication in
                    pamphlet form, and in the public press. It was agreed that 10,000 copies should
                    be printed and <lb/>distributed as follows:--for Iowa, Indiana and Ohio, and New
                    York yearly meetings, each 1500 copies; Western and Baltimore, <lb/>each 1,000
                    copies and New England 2,000 copies. It was also agreed that the publication in
                    the public press should be left to Friends <lb/>in their respective
                    neighborhoods.</p>
                <p>On 2nd day, evening, the conference met pursuant to adjournment, and the
                    following Report was submitted to be entered on <lb/>our minutes.</p>
                <p>We met the Committees of the two houses of <orgName key="uscong"
                        >Congress</orgName> as previously arranged. Our memorial was read and the
                    object of our <lb/>interview freely discussed. <persName key="gharn1">General
                        HARNEY</persName>, who had recently arrived from the scene of his peaceful
                    operations with the Great <lb/><orgName key="sioux">Sioux Nation</orgName>,
                    numbering 28,000 individuals, was present, and fully confirmed the position
                    assumed by the Indian Peace Commission- <lb/>ers, that it is easier, better, and
                    cheaper to conquer the Indians by kindness and justice than by all the forces of
                    unscrupulous war.</p>
                <p>We then called upon <persName key="ggran1">General GRANT</persName>, and were
                    introduced by <persName key="wils1">Senator WILSON</persName>, of <placeName
                        key="mass">Massachusetts</placeName>. After stating the object of <lb/>our
                    visit, to which he listened with respectful attention, he informed us that he
                    was familiar with the past management of Indian <lb/>affairs, and sensible of
                    the injustice to which they have been subjected,--and he expressed his views
                    sufficiently at length to show <lb/>that he desired, so far as he could, to
                    remedy the abuses of our Indian system.</p>
                <p>We then called upon the Committee on Appropriations, and had a satisfactory
                    interview with a prominent member of that <lb/>committee, who explained some of
                    the difficulties which surround the subject. He assured us of the desire of
                        <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName> to have the <lb/>money, to which
                    the Indians were entitled, faithfully applied for the <gap/>benefit; and he
                    expressed the confident belief that it the <lb/>Society of Friends, or any other
                    religious or benevolent association, in whom <orgName key="uscong"
                        >Congress</orgName> could feel confidence, would establish mis- <lb/>sions
                    amongst the Indians, and send competent and reliable persons to instruct and aid
                    them in the arts of civilized life, <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName>
                    <lb/>would appropriate all the money necessary to that end.</p>
                <p>Upon a review of the facts now reported, it is the judgment of the Conference
                    that full information should be given to the <lb/>members of all our Yearly
                    Meetings, so that any right concern to labor in the field which has thus opened
                    before us, may be <lb/>encouraged and carried out. And it is our united belief
                    that the remuneration of the agents and representatives of our Religious
                    <lb/>Society should be defrayed by the society, and not diminish the Indians’
                    funds.</p>
                <p>We feel that in assembling together our own weakness and inability to labor in
                    the vineyard of our Lord, except as called and aided <lb/>by His Holy Spirit, we
                    separate in mutual love, and desires that each of us shall faithfully attend to
                    every duty that may open <lb/>before, and be laid upon us.</p>

                <p>The Memorial of the undersigned, representatives of <orgName key="cond7">Seven
                        Yearly Meetings</orgName>
                    <lb/>of the Religious Society of Friends in the States of MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
                    MASSACHU- <lb/>SETTS, VERMONT, RHODE ISLAND, CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, MICHIGAN,
                    MARYLAND, VIR-<lb/>GINIA. OHIO, INDIANA, ILLINOIS, IOWA and KANSAS,
                    <lb/>Respectfully represents:--</p>
                <p>That we have met in the City of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>
                    unitedly to consider our Christian <lb/>duty in reference to the present
                    condition of the Indians of our country.</p>
                <p>Whilst thus engaged, having before us the Report of the Joint Special Committee
                    <lb/>of <orgName key="uscong">Congress</orgName> upon the <q>Condition of the
                        Indian Tribes, printed <date when="1867-01-26">January 26, 1867</date>,</q>
                    and that <lb/>of the <q>Indian Peace Commission, <date when="1868-01-14">January
                            14th, 1868</date>,</q> and subsequent reports of the civil <lb/>and
                    military proceedings in reference to the Indians, we have realized the deep
                    responsibility <lb/>which rests upon all members of a community professing to be
                    Christians, in their dealings <lb/>and intercourse with the feeble remnants of
                    the aboriginal inhabitants of this land.</p>
                <p>In contemplating the disgraceful facts revealed in those Reports, and the
                    admission of <lb/>our own witnesses that our wars with the Indians, which have
                    been almost constant, have been <lb/>uniformly caused by injustice on the part
                    of our white citizens and of <orgName key="usag">Government</orgName>
                    officials,* <lb/>we are reminded of the fact that the Treaty of the Indians with
                        <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName> was faith- <lb/>fully kept
                    during the seventy years, in which the <orgName key="penngov">Government of
                        Pennsylvania</orgName> was admin- <lb/>istered upon the principles of its
                    founder; and history tells us that <q>Whilst the surrounding <lb/>Colonies were
                        ever and anon at war with the Indians, and the scalping knife and tomahowk
                        <lb/>brought to death and terror to many a hearth, the Pennsylvanians and
                        all their possessions <lb/>remained uninjured.</q><q>The Indians remembered
                        the Treaty with the sons of Onas (Penn) <lb/>and kept it inviolate.</q></p>
                <p>Is there any reason to suppose that the Indians of the present day are less
                    disposed <lb/>to be faithful to their engagements than were their ancestors? The
                    testimony of <persName key="cbent2">Colonel <lb/>Bent</persName>, confimed by
                    other witnesses, before the Joint Committee above referred to, states,
                    <lb/>after thirty-six years experience in the vicinity of the Indians against
                    whom the United <lb/>States Army is now engaged in hostile operations, that
                    nearly every instance of difficulties <lb/>between the Indians and the whites
                    during his residence there, were from aggressions on the <lb/>Indians by the
                    whites. And after giving an interesting detail of the causes which have,
                    <lb/>directly or indirectly, led to the present deplorable state of affairs,
                    this experienced witness <lb/>closed his testimony with these remarkable words:
                        <q>If the matter were left to me I would <lb/>guaranty with my life that in
                        three months I could have all the Indians along the <placeName key="arkan"
                            >Arkansas</placeName>
                        <lb/>at peace, without the expense of war.</q></p>
                <p>But we do not desire to dwell upon the sickening history of the past except to
                    <lb/>guard against its repetition in the future. Whilst the white men, whose
                    brutal murders <lb/>have brought upon many innocent settlers the vengence of an
                    outraged savage for, still go <lb/>unpunished, with blood <gap/>their hands
                    demand the extermination of the Indians, <lb/>many of the Tribes, both innocent
                    and guilty of retaliation, have been destroyed by the <lb/>sword, and their
                    survivors have been reduced to subjection, and have submitted themselves <lb/>to
                    the sense of justice in the white man's breast.</p>
                <p>Whilst we have no sympathy with wrong or outrage of any kind, we cannot but
                    <lb/>express the hope that the further shedding of blood shall cease, and that
                    the leniency which <lb/>becomes a powerful nation may be extended to the
                    children of the forest who have been <lb/>struggling for their right to live
                    upon the soil of their ancestors.</p>
                <p>
                    <quote type="poem">Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule <lb/>And righteous
                        limitation of its act, <lb/>By which heaven moves in pardoning guilty man;
