                <p>IN one of my frequent visits to <persName key="dhosa1">Dr. Hosack</persName>, for
                    the<lb/>purpose of obtaiing from him various kinds of<lb/>information, to aid me
                    in completing a work I was<lb/>then engaged in editing-the proper
                    acknowledg-<lb/>ments for his learned and valuable assistance, I have<lb/>made
                    in another place-he suggested to me that he<lb/>had some time since gathered
                    materials for writing<lb/>the life of a distinguished philanthropist, the
                        late<lb/><persName key="teddy1">THOMAS EDDY</persName>; but that numerous
                    circumstances<lb/>had prevented him from carrying his intentions
                    into<lb/>effect, and that he could not, at this time, sit down<lb/>to the work.
                    After some farther conversation, he<lb/> placed the papers in my hand, and I
                    found them very<lb/>interesting, much more so than I could have
                    antici-<lb/>pated, from the quiet life of a modest citizen. Among<lb/> them I
                    discovered a correspondence with some of the<lb/>first men in <placeName
                        key="euro">Europe</placeName> and the United States, upon the<lb/>great
                    objects of reform in prisons, hospitals, penal<lb/> codes, schools, and almost
                    every other topic, which<lb/>the best minds of the civilized world are now
                    dis-<lb/><pb n="6" facs="SW_TE1834_005"/>cussing. I readily agreed to put those papers in<lb/>
                    order, connected with a few remarks of my own, to<lb/> the end that the public
                    might have some idea of <persName key="teddy1">Mr.<lb/> Eddy</persName> as a
                    man, and of the great objects of his useful<lb/> life. To show me the estimation
                    in which <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName><lb/> was held by the wise
                    and good, which had known<lb/> him well, <persName key="dhosa1">Dr.
                        Hosack</persName> put into my hands the follow-<lb/>ing letters, from men
                    whose sincerity is above all<lb/> doubt, and whose opinions have a
                    commanding<lb/>weight in society.</p>

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I have thought it due to the memory of the late <persName key="teddy1"
                                >Thomas Eddy</persName>,<lb/> whose life has been very much devoted
                            to deeds of benevolence,<lb/> and the improvement of the numerous public
                            institutions with<lb/> which he has been connected, to communicate to
                            the public some<lb/> account of his labours, and the services he has
                            rendered to this<lb/> city and state.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose, I have placed the materials which I had col-<lb/>lected
                            on this subject, into the hands of our friend, <persName key="sknap1"
                                >Colonel Knapp</persName>,<lb/> who has kindly undertaken to embody
                            them into a volume, that<lb/> cannot fail to be gladly received by the
                            community.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that you were one of the friends of <persName key="teddy1">Mr.

                            possess, that will give an interest to the<lb/> contemplated publication

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I was happy to learn, by your letter of the <date when="1833-04-09">9th
                                ult.</date>, that you<lb/> had made arrangements for an historical
                            account of the life and<lb/> services of your late excellent relative,
                                <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>, by con-<lb/>fiding
                            the materials in your possession, concerning him, to the<lb/> industry,
                            skill, judgment, and taste of <persName key="sknap1">Colonel
                                Knapp</persName>. I am<lb/> satisfied that a biographical sketch of
                            the actions and character <lb/>of so distinguished a philanthropist,
                            will be interesting to the<lb/> cause of humanity, and acceptable to the
                            public. It was my <lb/>good fortune to be numbered among the intimate
                            friends of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. <lb/><pb n="10" facs="SW_TE1834_008"/>Eddy</persName>,
                            from the year <date when="1795">1795</date> down to the period of his
                            death; and<lb/>I am no stranger to the beneficial influence which he so
                            long and<lb/> so successfully exerted over the several public
                            institutions with<lb/>which he was connected. You are pleased to say,
                            that you<lb/>would <said>be obliged by any reminiscences I may posess,
                                that<lb/>will give an interest to the contemplated
                                publication.</said> This<lb/>request you have recently repeated, and
                            if I was in possession of<lb/>any facts that were important, and which
                            are not already matter<lb/>of record, I would most cheerfully
                            communicate them. The<lb/> quiet and unostentatious private life of
                                <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>,
                            afforded,<lb/>however, very few materials of the kind you allude to, and
                            it is<lb/>solely from a desire to gratify your wishes, and to show
                            my<lb/>affection for his memory, that I have ventured (though not
                            with-<lb/>out hesitation and reluctance) to submit a few notices
                            respecting<lb/> my personal knowledge of his character.</p>
                        <p>When I first became acquainted with <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName>, about the<lb/>year <date when="1795">1795</date>, I
                            was struck with the simplicity of his manners, and<lb/>the
                            reasonableness and benevolence of his views. I soon found<lb/>uncommon
                            zeal for the promotion of all kinds of public improve-<lb/>ment. His
                            object and unshaken purpose seemed to be, to diffuse,<lb/>by every
                            possible and reasonable effort on his part, a liberal,<lb/>enlightened,
                            humane, active, and Christian public spirit. He pos-<lb/>sessed, far
                            beyond the race of ordinary men, the philanthropy of<lb/><persName
                                key="jhowa1">Howard</persName>; and under the influence of so
                            illustrious an example,<lb/>he appeared to be willing to devote himself
                                <quote>to survey the man-<lb/>sions of sorrow and pain,</quote> and
                            to mitigate human misery, in<lb/>whatever form it might meet the eye or
                            awaken sympathy.</p>
                        <p>It was among his earliest and most animating objects, to<lb/>endeavour to
                            work a reformation in our penal code, and disarm<lb/>it of its enormous
                            abuses and uncompromising severity. His<lb/>efforts in the year <date
                                when="1794">1794</date>, <date when="1795">1795</date>, and <date
                                when="1796">1796</date>, to arouse public attention<lb/>to the
                            subject; and to promote the establishment of a state or
                            peni-<lb/>tentiary prison, as a substitute for the profligate goals and
                            san-<lb/>guinary punishments, are a matter of fact, which it is not my
                            pro-<lb/>vince to detail; I would merely observe, that in <date
                                when="1797">1797</date> I became<lb/> one of the persons charged
                                <emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">ex
                                officio</foreign></emph> with the execution of the<lb/>penal laws,
                            and this was concurrently in point of time with the<lb/>melioration of
                            the criminal code to which I have alluded, and it<lb/><pb n="11" facs="SW_TE1834_009"
                            />naturally led me to perceive and feel in full force, the
                            inestimable<lb/>value of the change. My friendly connexion with
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName><lb/>kept gradually
                            increasing, and his ardent and disinterested<lb/>efforts for the credit
                            and success of the penitentiary system, were<lb/>constantly passing
                            under my eye and observation. He continued<lb/>an inspector of the state
                            prison in this city, from its first erection<lb/>in <date when="1796"
                                >1796</date>, to the year <date when="1803">1803</date>, and it is a
                            fact well worthy of notice,<lb/>that the last year in which he had an
                            agency in the management<lb/>of the prison,the profits of the labour of
                            the convicts equalled<lb/>the annual expense of the establishment. The
                            prison for that<lb/> year, and that year only, maintained itself. But
                            though <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName><lb/>had retired from the
                            post, he never ceased to be anxious to<lb/>improve and recommend the
                            system. So late as the year <date when="1823">1823</date>,<lb/>he
                            addressed a letter to the mayor of this city, suggesting
                            some<lb/>judicious reforms in the prison discipline; and which have
                            since<lb/>been essentially adopted. He never placed much reliance
                            on<lb/>the influence of fear and severity, and he was of opinion
                            that<lb/>the reformation of the convicts was to be regarded as an
                            indis-<lb/>pensable object of the system.</p>
                        <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was in the habit of
                            recommending to my notice<lb/>those publications which appeared from
                            time to time to strike<lb/>his mind with particular force; and those
                            that he alluded to, or<lb/>presented to me, uniformly related to
                            charitable, benevolent, or<lb/>religious objects. I recal the
                            recollection of such acts with<lb/> much pleasure, because they give us
                            an insight into his real<lb/>character, and afford incontestable
                            evidence of the goodness of<lb/>his heart, and of his constant and
                            affectionate solicitude for the<lb/>happiness of his friends. He
                            appeared to possess a firm Chris-<lb/>tian faith, without a particle of
                            bigotry or fanaticism, and it was<lb/>softened or recommended by the
                            spirit of charity. He was the<lb/>determined enemy of every species of
                            doctrine that was lax in<lb/> morals, or led to licentiousness in
                            practice; and the anecdote<lb/>which I am about to relate, is strikingly
                            characteristic of the<lb/>firm purpose with which he met and resisted
                            the false philoso-<lb/>phy and profane speculations that were zealously
                            propagated<lb/>towards the conclusion of the last century. Having
                            purchased<lb/>Godwin's "Enquiry concerning Political Justice," which
                            obtained<lb/>a transient celebrity in the year <date when="1795"
                                >1795</date>, his moral sense was so<lb/>much offended by the
                            abominable doctrines contained in the lat-<lb/><pb n="12" facs="SW_TE1834_010"/>ter part of
                            the second volume, (and which doctrines Mr. Godwin<lb/> afterwards
                            exemplified in his own case,) that he took at once a<lb/> decisive step
                            to clear himself of the folly, or the guilt, of encour-<lb/>aging and
                            circulating the work. He rose one evening at his<lb/> own fireside, from
                            the perusal of the book, and silently, and with<lb/> gravity, opened the
                            embers in the fire place, and carefully laid <lb/>down and buried the
                            two volumes in the fire. His wife, who was<lb/> sitting by, astonished
                            at the act, and ignorant of the cause, started<lb/> up and exclaimed,
                                <said>Thomas, art thou crazy?</said></p>
                        <p>He was one of the governors of the <placeName key="newyh">New York
                                Hospital</placeName> in<lb/>
                            <date when="1797">1797</date>, and I believe, had been one for some
                            previous time; and I<lb/> considered myself as principally indebted to
                            him for my intro-<lb/>duction in that year to the same trust. He acted
                            as one of the<lb/> guardians of the hospital down to the spring of <date
                                when="1827">1827</date>; and the<lb/> value of his services must
                            have been inestimable. The duties<lb/> which in that place were cast
                            upon him, were congenial with his<lb/> disposition and character; and
                            that great establishment is deserv-<lb/>edly classed among the most
                            comprehensive, practical, and bene-<lb/>ficent of all the charitable
                            institutions of this country. I know <lb/>of none that affords more
                            prompt and effectual relief to the mise-<lb/>ries of the poorer and
                            forsaken part of mankind. He was for<lb/> several years vice president,
                            and at the period of his resignation,<lb/> president of the board. He
                            came to me in the spring of <date when="1827">1827</date>,<lb/> (being a
                            few months before his death,) and told me that his declin-<lb/>ing
                            health would not permit him to continue in the trust, and he<lb/>
                            earnestly requested my consent to serve, if I should be chosen<lb/> one
                            of the governors. Moved by his application, I did consent,<lb/> and
                            faithful to my promise to him, I bore my portion of my bur-<lb/>den of
                            the trust, for the three succeeding years ; and while in<lb/> that
                            place, I could trace the influence and effects of that excellent<lb/>
                            man, in every branch of the institution. <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName> was deeply<lb/> impressed with the account of
                                    <q><emph rend="italic">the Retreat</emph>,</q> an asylum
                            near<lb/>the city of <placeName key="york2">York</placeName>, in
                            England, erected for insane persons, and<lb/> which was much indebted
                            for its success to the early and steady<lb/> efforts of <persName
                                key="lmurr1">Lindley Murray</persName>, a name familiar to the

                            he suggested the propriety of efforts<lb/> to erect and establish a
                            similar institution on this island; and one<lb/> that should adopt the
                            same course of moral treatment of the luna-<lb/>tic patients. He
                            presented to me at the time, a description of the<lb/><pb n="13" facs="SW_TE1834_011"/>Retreat, written by <persName key="stuke1">Samuel Tuke</persName>, and
                            he always appeared to be<lb/> anxious to enlist my humble voice and
                            influence in favour of his<lb/> plans of public benevolence. Provisions
                            for such an establish-<lb/>ment was made by law in <date when="1816"

                            and <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName> were scholars in the same

                            in or about the year <date when="1770">1770</date>, and their
                            subsequent<lb/> lives were devoted to charitable objects, with a
                            steadiness of pur-<lb/>pose, and an ardour of zeal, that were peculiar,
                            and at the same<lb/>time tempered with reason and discretion. It would
                            appear to<lb/> me to be very difficult in the annals of mere mortals, to
                            find a<lb/> higher and brighter example of active and unobtrusive
                            charity,<lb/> goodness, and piety, than the one afforded by the life of

                        <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was an official agent in many
                            other public institu-<lb/>tions of a charitable kind, and he was engaged
                            for a length of<lb/> years in some that were more comprehensive in their
                            operation,<lb/> and related to the great commercial and political
                            interests of the<lb/> state. He took an early and active part in the
                            cause of internal<lb/> navigation and improvement. His good sense,
                            striking probity,<lb/> and public spirit, were known and highly

                            public wel-<lb/>fare. He was early made a director in the Western Inland

                        <p> But <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy's</persName> mind was equally and

                            pretensions. Whenever<lb/> there was an institution within the reach of

                            day was bright and beautiful,<lb/> and having landed at <placeName
                                key="sings">Sing Sing</placeName>, we placed ourselves under
                            the<lb/>guidance of <persName key="clynd1">Captain Lyndes</persName>,
                            and visited the new state prison<lb/> establishment, which was then
                            quite unfinished. We found one<lb/> hundred and thirty convicts engaged
                            in quarrying and working<lb/> marble for the building; and they were
                            mostly out under a meri-<lb/>dian sun, pouring its fierce blaze upon the
                            white marble blocks<lb/> around them, with an ardour almost sufficient
                            to blind the eyes.<lb/>
                            <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> seemed to be at home in all
                            the details of the concern.<lb/> His zeal for the improvement of
                            penitentiary discipline had not<lb/> diminished in intensity. He was
                            thorough in his inspection, and <lb/>inquisitive in his examination. We
                            continued our journey that<lb/> afternoon to the residence of <persName
                                key="jjay1">Governor Jay</persName>, at <placeName key="bedfo"
                                    >Bedford</placeName>, and we <lb/><pb n="15" facs="SW_TE1834_013"/>found that illustrious
                            statesman and christian sage, sitting on the<lb/> piazza under the
                            lengthened shadows of the sun, with a long<lb/> pipe by his side, in
                            full view of the simple and solid rural<lb/> improvements of the place;
                            and in the attitude of one at peace<lb/> with himself, and with all
                            around him. I was painfully struck<lb/> with the ravages of time upon
                            him, and the change that had taken<lb/> place in his visage and
                            appearance, since I last had the satisfac-<lb/>tion of seeing him some
                            years before. At first, he did not appear<lb/> to recollect me; and this
                            was the only instance that I perceived<lb/> of any direct decay of his
                            mental faculties. He conversed that<lb/> evening and the next morning
                            cheerfully and correctly, and<lb/> seemed to be much interested in
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy's</persName> conversation, and
                            to<lb/> sympathise with him in his feelings and concerns. Those two<lb/>
                            venerable men (the one then being in his seventy-sixth year, and<lb/>
                            the other in his eighty-first year) had been intimate friends; with<lb/>
                            correspondent principles in all matters of personal duty, and of<lb/>
                            good will to men, from a period which commenced soon after the<lb/>
                            conclusion of the American war. We returned to town the next<lb/> day,
                            and <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy,</persName> in the course of this
                            tour, interested me<lb/> exceedingly with anecdotes and occurrences
                            connected with his<lb/> early life, in this city, during the
                            revolutionary war, and down to<lb/> the period of our first
                            acquaintance. I have only to add, that<lb/> while upon this last visit,
                            his cheerful, free, varied, and instructive<lb/> conversation, gave me
                            additional cause to love and admire him.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I some time since determined to prepare a sketch of the life of<lb/> the

                            to the cause of humanity and benevolence. For this<lb/> purpose I have
                            collected many valuable materials; these I have<lb/> placed in the hands
                            of my friend. <persName key="sknap1">Colonel Knapp</persName>, who will

                            MY DEAR SIR,</opener>
                        <p> It gives me great pleasure to learn that the biography of<lb/>
                            <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName> is to be written by so
                            able a hand as <persName key="sknap1">Mr. Knapp.</persName><lb/> I
                            should be very happy to give him any information in my power,<lb/> which
                            might tend to rescue from oblivion the merits and many<lb/> virtues of
                            our deceased friend. All I can say might be comprised<lb/> in these few
                            words:—That I knew him, and was very much asso-<lb/>ciated with him
                            during the last thirty years of his life ; and that<lb/> there is no
                            benevolent or charitable institution founded in that time,<lb/> of which
                            he was not the zealous promoter, if the project for its<lb/>
                            establishment did not originate with him. I would be more
                            par-<lb/>ticular, but my memory does not serve me as to dates, and I
                            have<lb/> no documents to which I can refer. I will nevertheless
                            attempt<lb/> to give the general recollections of my associations with
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>.<lb/> If it should be
                            important to ascertain the dates connected with<lb/> the circumstances I
                            shall mention; it may be done by resorting<lb/> to the public records,
                            or the records of institutions of which he<lb/> was a member.</p>
                        <p>So far as I recollect, my first acquaintance with <persName key="teddy1"
                                >Mr. Eddy</persName> com-<lb/>menced, from our having had the same
                            views as to what has been<lb/> called the amelioration of our criminal
                            code. I mean the criminal<lb/> code of the state of <placeName
                                key="newyo">New York</placeName>; and you must understand me<lb/>
                            throughout as writing as if I were in <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName>; I was then quite<lb/> a young man, and I am not
                            certain that my mind did not receive<lb/> the strong bias it had in
                            favour of the abolition of the punishment<lb/> of death, from <persName
                                key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>; though I, at that time, differed
                            from <lb/><pb n="18" facs="SW_TE1834_016"/> him as to the extent of this abolition : he
                            desiring that life should<lb/> not be taken in any case; and I believing
                            that this highest<lb/> punishment should be reserved for the highest
                            crimes. After-<lb/>wards, in the year <date when="1825">1825</date>, I
                            think, when <persName key="salle1">Mr. Allen</persName>, <persName
                                key="gtibb1">Mr. Tibbits</persName>,<lb/> and <persName key="shopk1"
                                >Mr. Hopkins</persName>, were making some investigations relative
                            to<lb/> the state prison, they circulated a number of queries, and
                            addressed<lb/> copies of them to <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName> and myself. We each wrote answers.<lb/> They came so
                            late, that they are not printed with the report of<lb/> the
                            commissioners; but Mr. Eddy being unwilling that they<lb/> should be
                            lost, obtained from me a copy of my answers to the<lb/>commissioners,
                            and published his and mine in a small pamphlet <lb/>at his expense. This
                            is evidence of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s liberality,
                            not<lb/> only as to pecuniary consideration, but as to his toleration of
                            prin-<lb/>ciples which differed from his own; for while his letters to
                            the<lb/> commissioners, zealously maintained that imprisonment was
                            suf-<lb/>ficient punishment for any crime ; I expressed the opinion
                            that<lb/> I at that time continued to entertain, that the most
                            atrocious<lb/> guilt, such as wilful and deliberate murder, should be
                            punished<lb/> with death. Before I pursue this subject farther, I will
                            mention<lb/> a circumstance which made a strong impression on my mind,
                            and<lb/> convinced me, that however adverse the Society of Friends
                            were<lb/> to the punishment of death, they had rather that it should
                            be<lb/> inflicted in some cases, than that the guilty should escape
                            with<lb/> impunity. A female belonging to the Society, or who was
                            at<lb/> least professedly a Friend, was found a corpse, under
                            circumstan-<lb/>ces that left no doubt of her having been murdered. I
                            was then<lb/> assistant attorney general. The first information I had of
                            this<lb/> crime, was from <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>,
                                <persName key="rbown1">Robert Browne</persName>, and several others
                            of the<lb/> same high standing in the Society of Friends, who called on
                            me to<lb/> institute a prosecution against the person suspected; and
                            through the<lb/> whole progress of the prosecution they were active and
                            zealous in<lb/> their efforts to furnish me with the means of developing
                            the truth.</p>
                        <p> It is well known that the laws for establishing our state prison,<lb/>
                            owed their origin more to the part taken by the Society of Friends,<lb/>
                            than to any exertions in their favour by any other class in the
                            com-<lb/>munity. And among these, <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName>, as he was in every thing<lb/> in which he engaged,
                            the most active and the most zealous, in<lb/> this matter, as in others,
                            in which the public good was concerned,<lb/> be devoted himself to its
                            success, with all the industry and earnest-<lb/><pb n="19" facs="SW_TE1834_017"/>ness, that
                            he could have done if his own interest had been his<lb/> object; and I
                            am convinced that he would not have felt the same<lb/> gratification
                            from obtaining any private advantage, that he did,<lb/> from the
                            adoption of those laws by the legislature, which he had<lb/> long and
                            ardently advocated, and which he considered as setting<lb/> an example
                            which would meliorate the condition of mankind.<lb/> The members of the
                            first board of governors of the state prison<lb/> were mostly taken from
                            the society of Friends. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>
                            held<lb/> the principal office, under the title, I think, of
                            superintendent.</p>
                        <p> The assistant attorney general was, ex-officio, connected with<lb/> the
                            administration of the prison, and this gave me an oppor-<lb/>tunity of
                            observing its management and government. The<lb/> good order, comfort,
                            cleanliness, industry, and devotion which<lb/> prevailed, as long as the
                            Friends had the management of the<lb/> institution, were very
                            remarkable. But in <date when="1800">1800</date>, when there<lb/> was a
                            great revolution in political power, those who had effected<lb/> the
                            change thought their influence should be felt every where;<lb/> and
                            though there was no emolument annexed to the office of<lb/> governor of
                            the prison, there were those of the dominant party,<lb/> whose ambition
                            was to be gratified by being put in the place of<lb/> the Friends who
                            were managers of the institution. The differ-<lb/>ence between the
                            government of those who took the office merely<lb/> from motives of
                            philanthropy, and who devoted themselves to the<lb/> discharge of its
                            duties, and those who held it as an honorary dis-<lb/>tinction, that
                            deserved but little sacrifice of their private business,<lb/> was soon
                            perceived. The new management was so bad, that it<lb/> had very nearly
                            occasioned the failure of this great experiment;<lb/> and nothing was
                            more common than to hear it said, even by<lb/> many of its original
                            advocates, that it had done so, and that there<lb/> was no resource but
                            to the former sanguinary penal code. I have<lb/> often heard <persName
                                key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> lament this state of things; but he
                            never<lb/> abandoned the hope of seeing a system, of which he very
                            justly<lb/> considered himself as one of the founders, established; and
                            he<lb/> lost no opportunity of inviting the public attention to means
                            by<lb/> which he thought the objections to the new code might be
                            obviated.<lb/> He proposed that county or district prisons or
                            penitentiaries should<lb/> be erected. That the prison of the state
                            should be reserved for<lb/> offenders of the highest grade, while those
                            of a lower degree<lb/> should be punished in the former. I am convinced
                            that among <lb/><pb n="20" facs="SW_TE1834_018"/>his manuscripts will be found many pieces
                            that he has written<lb/> on this subject.</p>
                        <p>It is very possible that my connexion with the <orgName key="nyman"
                                >Manumission<lb/> Society</orgName>, brought me acquainted with him
                            as a member of that<lb/> institution, previously to my having had
                            intercourse with him as<lb/> an advocate of the amelioration of our
                            penal code. It is known<lb/> how much that society is, and always has
                            been, in the hands of<lb/> members of the society of Friends, and how
                            far the act abo-<lb/>lishing slavery, is owing to their exertions. In
                            this, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName><lb/> took a leading
                            part. I well remember, however, that he was<lb/> adverse to the
                            colonization society; and he discouraged the first<lb/> attempts which
                            were made to establish a branch of the society<lb/> in <placeName
                                key="nycit">New York</placeName>. He thought it was a scheme of the
                            slave holders<lb/> to perpetuate slavery, rather than intended as a
                            means of eman-<lb/>cipation. Their design, in his opinion, was to make
                            the society<lb/>instrumental in ridding them of their old or worthless
                            slaves, and<lb/> thereby enable them to perpetuate the bondage of the
                            young and<lb/> valuable; whereas, if the slave holding states were
                            obliged to<lb/> bear the burthen of those the society would take off
                            their hands,<lb/> he thought these states would the sooner be compelled
                            to adopt<lb/> measures that would give freedom to the blacks. <placeName
                                key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy's</placeName> rea-<lb/>soning on this subject,
                            induced me to adopt his sentiments. But if<lb/> he had lived to have had
                            a better view of the objects of the Society,<lb/> and to witness their
                            extraordinary success, I cannot doubt but that<lb/> he would have
                            yielded, as I have done, his prejudices against this<lb/> valuable
                            institution. I am the more induced to think that this<lb/> would have
                            been the case, from considering the very active part<lb/> which
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> afterwards took in a
                            project which was set on<lb/> foot, I think, in the year <date
                                when="1825">1825</date>, and to which, if it had succeeded,<lb/>
                            there would have been the same objections which there were in<lb/> his
                            mind to colonization societies. About the time I have men-<lb/>tioned,
                            the President of <placeName key="haiti">Hayti</placeName> sent a
                                <persName key="grand2">Mr. Grandville</persName>, a coloured<lb/>
                            gentleman, as an ambassador to <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName>. His object was to<lb/> induce black people to
                            emigrate to that island, at the expense of<lb/> its government, with an
                            offer of land and means of living when<lb/> they arrived there.
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was indefatigable in his
                            exertions<lb/> to promote the views of Mr. <persName key="grand2"
                                >Grandville</persName>. He formed a society for<lb/> this purpose.
                            Considerable funds were raised, and the Haytian<lb/> emissary returned
                            to his government with a cargo of emigrants.<lb/>
                            <pb n="21" facs="SW_TE1834_019"/>They were accompanied by an agent of the society, who
                            managed<lb/> to quarrel with the government of the island. The
                            emigrants<lb/> were disappointed. They alleged that the promises made
                            to<lb/> them were not fulfilled, and the whole thing ended in a
                            heavy<lb/> expense to the members of the Society.</p>
                        <p> There was nothing in which <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>
                            took a deeper or more<lb/> active interest, than in the establishment of
                            our free schools. But<lb/> I had no particular connexion with that
                            institution. I can there-<lb/>fore only say, that I have often visited
                            them with him, and been<lb/> witness of the zeal he manifested for their
                            prosperity. <persName key="dclin1">Go-<lb/>vernor Clinton</persName> was
                            the great patron of this and other benevolent<lb/> establishments, in
                            which <persName key="teddy1">Mr Eddy</persName> was concerned; and I
                            believe<lb/> we owe the assistance they have derived from <persName
                                key="dclin1">Mr. Clinton</persName>'s great<lb/> talents and
                            influence, more to <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> than to
                            any other man.<lb/> The history of the New York canals will show how
                            large a<lb/> share <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> had in
                            directing <persName key="dclin1">Governor Clinton</persName>'s attention
                            to<lb/> these great projects.</p>
                        <p> I found <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> a governor of the
                                <placeName key="newyh">New York Hospital</placeName>, (of<lb/> which
                            he died president) when I was elected to that office about<lb/> the year
                                <date when="1812">1812</date>. I believe he had been in that station
                            from a very<lb/> early date. There, as elsewhere, he was one of the most
                            efficient<lb/> and useful members of the institution to which he
                            belonged. In<lb/> the year <date when="1816">1816</date>, I think the
                            legislature made a very liberal grant<lb/> of an increased revenue to
                            the hospital. This was obtained<lb/> entirely by the exertions and
                            address of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, who spent<lb/>
                            the greater part of a winter at <placeName key="alban"
                                >Albany</placeName>, to obtain the grant. Per-<lb/>haps the
                            institution is more indebted to the good management of<lb/>
                            <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, than to the liberality of
                            the legislature. For it has<lb/> been said, and I believe, not without
                            foundation, that the members<lb/> of the legislature were not aware of
                            the extent of their endow-<lb/>ment. The duration of annuity which is
                            granted, depends on<lb/> the duration of a previous grant, which, it is
                            said, it was supposed<lb/>was more limited, than upon examination is
                            found to be the case.<lb/> But this ample provision induced the
                            governors of the hospital<lb/> to turn their attention to a separate
                            establishment for the insane,<lb/> for whom the accommodations afforded
                            by the city buildings were<lb/> very inconvenient. In making a new
                            provision for this class of<lb/> patients, <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName> engaged with his accustomed energy, and<lb/> from
                            his exertions, and the co-operation of those associated with<lb/><pb
                                n="22" facs="SW_TE1834_020"/>him, grew the magnificent Lunatic Asylum at <placeName
                                key="bloomd">Bloomingdale</placeName>,<lb/> He was chairman of the
                            committee of Governors of the Hospi-<lb/>tal under whose superintendence
                            the buildings were erected, and<lb/> who had the management of the
                            concern till the patients were<lb/> removed to it; and till long after a
                            system was arranged for the <lb/>government of the house and the
                            treatment of the subjects. In<lb/> all this, no one had so large a part
                            as <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, and no one<lb/> devoted
                            so much time and attention to the establishment.</p>
                        <p> As any thing I may write, can only serve as memoranda, which<lb/> will

                            biographer to the history<lb/> or records of the institutions with which
                            he was connected, I<lb/> may mention that I was a long time associated
                            with him as a<lb/> member of the <orgName key="humso">Humane
                                Society</orgName>. This was an association, which<lb/> had its
                            origin long before I knew any thing of it. The objects<lb/> of this
                            association, were to provide food for the destitute, and,<lb/>
                            particularly, to supply the debtors in prison with some of the<lb/>
                            necessaries of life. At that time these objects of charity made<lb/> an
                            irresistible appeal to the attention of the benevolent. For it<lb/> is
                            strange that the laws which shut a person up within the walls<lb/> of a
                            prison, because he did not, and in most cases could not, pay<lb/> his
                            debt, made no provision for supplying him either with fire,<lb/> food,
                            or raiment. As you well know, the first soup house that was<lb/> ever
                            opened in <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, was established
                            by this society, and it<lb/> should not be forgotten, that the fears of
                            the members that their funds<lb/> were not equal to this enterprise,
                            were overcome by your liberal<lb/> engagement to defray from out your
                            own purse all that might be<lb/> required, beyond the means the friends
                            of the society could afford.</p>
                        <p> The views which were presented to many members of this<lb/> society, of
                            the condition of the poor in the city of <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>, led<lb/> to the formation, in the year <date
                                when="1816">1816</date>, of a <orgName key="spaup">society for the
                                prevention<lb/>of pauperism</orgName>; in the establishment of
                            which, and in its action,<lb/>
                            <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> took a more active part than
                            any other man. This<lb/> society was merged in the <orgName key="socref"
                                >Society for the Reformation of Juve-<lb/>nile
                            Delinquents</orgName>, or House of Refuge, which was incorporated
                            in<lb/> the year <date when="1824">1824</date>. This institution, after
                            it had been in operation<lb/> two years, <persName key="dclin1">Mr.
                                Clinton</persName> described in his annual message to the<lb/>

                                devised by the wit, and established by the<lb/>beneficence of
                                man.</said> I had a more intimate association with<lb/><pb n="23" facs="SW_TE1834_021"/><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> in this charity from
                            its origin to his death, than in any<lb/> of the others of which we were
                            members. Though there were<lb/> many who participated with him in this
                            humane enterprise, yet<lb/> I do not think it is going too far to say
                            that its foundation and<lb/> success was in a great measure owing to
                            him; at least it may<lb/> be questioned whether, without his
                            indefatigable exertions, this<lb/> important measure for the prevention
                            of crimes, would have been<lb/> adopted so soon. He devoted so much of
                            his time to this esta-<lb/>blishment, and occupied himself so much with
                            its concerns for<lb/> several years, that he seemed to have no business
                            of a public or<lb/>private nature which he thought so important, or so
                            deserving<lb/> his attention, It may be worthy of remark, that though
                            there<lb/> had been penitentiaries or asylums for infant criminals in
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>,<lb/> previously to the
                            establishment of the House of Refuge, yet<lb/> there had not been any
                            institution for the reformation of juvenile<lb/> delinquents. This
                            differed from all others that before existed in<lb/> this important
                            feature. That the laws subjected to its discipline<lb/> persons under
                            age, previously to their having committed any<lb/> crime, when they are
                            without parents, or abandoned by them,<lb/> and are left without
                            guardian or protection, and are found pur-<lb/>suing vicious courses,
                            they may be committed to the House of<lb/> Refuge, where they are
                            withdrawn from the power of their<lb/> parents even, till such
                            provisions is made for them as the law<lb/> prescribes. The idea of
                            giving this very enlarged power to<lb/> magistrates and managers of the
                            House of Refuge, I believe,<lb/> originated with <persName key="teddy1"
                                >Mr. Eddy</persName>. If the <orgName key="socref">society for the
                                reformation of<lb/> juvenile delinquents</orgName> was deprived of
                            this power, it would lose the<lb/> greater part of its usefulness.
                            Another of our most important<lb/> and benevolent institutions, owes its
                            origin to the members of the<lb/>
                            <orgName key="spaup">society for the prevention of pauperism</orgName>;
                            I refer to the <orgName key="nysav">Savings<lb/>Bank</orgName>. To this
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> devoted himself with his
                            usual zeal<lb/> and energy, and remained one of its most efficient and
                            active<lb/> managers while he lived.</p>
                        <p>To this list of the numerous benevolent societies of which <persName
                                key="teddy1">Mr.<lb/> Eddy</persName> was a member, I must add
                            another establishment, of which<lb/> he was a founder, and continued a
                            manager, until he thought<lb/> its successful operation was secured.
                            This was a society to pro-<lb/>vide fuel for the poor. Those who had not
                            the means of laying<lb/> up a store, were to deposit their money with
                            the society; who<lb/><pb n="24" facs="SW_TE1834_022"/>were to lay it out on wood or coal, at
                            the proper season when<lb/> these articles are cheapest; and to let the
                            depositor draw to the<lb/> amount of his deposit when it was most
                            needed, for the cost at<lb/> which it had been purchased by the society.
                            But <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy's</persName><lb/>other avocations
                            obliged him, after some time, to withdraw from<lb/> this institution;
                            and for the want of that zeal with which he<lb/> devoted himself to all
                            affairs of this kind in which he engaged,<lb/> or from some other cause,
                            this very benevolent attempt to relieve<lb/> the distress which so often
                            results from cold and poverty, after<lb/> one or two seasons, was
                            neglected or relinquished. Notwith-<lb/>standing <persName key="teddy1"
                                >Mr. Eddy</persName> was so successful and useful in the many<lb/>
                            humane institutions I have enumerated, his active and benevolent<lb/>
                            mind was engaged in other projects for the advantage or relief<lb/> of
                            the distressed; among these he had much at heart an asylum<lb/> for
                            convicts who had expiated their crime, by having suffered the<lb/>
                            punishment of imprisonment. He saw with all the sympathy of<lb/> his
                            character, the forlorn condition of those who, without money,<lb/>
                            without friends, and without character, were turned from the walls<lb/>
                            of a prison, to provide for themselves means of subsistence, and<lb/> to
                            whom there seems to be left the only alternative of committing<lb/> a
                            new crime, or of perishing. He proposed to establish for such<lb/>
                            objects a House of Refuge, where employment of some profit<lb/> should
                            be provided for them, until by their good conduct they<lb/> could
                            retrieve their character, and by their industry provide some<lb/> means
                            of support, till they could begin the world anew.</p>
                        <p>I have not referred to <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s
                            connexion with our literary<lb/> and scientific institutions, of all of
                            which I believe we were<lb/> members. Of his usefulness as an associate
                            with us in these<lb/> establishments, you will be much more able to
                            speak of him than<lb/> I am. And after all, my dear sir, I can not but
                            perceive how<lb/> little more I have done than if I had given a list of
                            our benevo-<lb/>lent and charitable institutions, and said that
                                <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was a zea-<lb/>lous and
                            efficient member of each of them. But then I should<lb/> have lost the
                            opportunity of saying how sincerely I respected his<lb/> character, and
                            of manifesting the desire that I have, that the<lb/> memory of his great
                            benevolence, his devotion to the welfare of<lb/> mankind, and his many
                            virtues, should be preserved; and that he<lb/> may he pointed out to
                            posterity, as an example of how much good<lb/> may be done by an
                            individual who will devote his time and talents<lb/><pb n="25" facs="SW_TE1834_023"/>to its
                            accomplishment. And had I not complied with your<lb/> request, I should
                            also have lost the pleasure which I have, my<lb/> dear sir, in assuring
                            you of the sincere respect with which</p>

                        <p>A personal acquaintance of more than twenty years with the<lb/> late Mr.
                                <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>, might justify me in
                            answering at some<lb/> length your several interrogatories concerning
                            his life and public<lb/> services; but I have deemed it most judicious
                            to restrict this com-<lb/>munication to a few particulars, inasmuch as
                            you are so amply<lb/> furnished with authentic materials for your
                            contemplated biogra-<lb/>phy. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>
                            was so intimately and for so long a period asso-<lb/>ciated with the men
                            and measure of most of our humane, bene-<lb/>volent, and literary
                            institutions, that his career is in no small<lb/> degree connected with
                            the history of those establishments, and<lb/> demonstrates that a
                            cardinal object of his pursuit, was to melio-<lb/>rate the condition of
                            human society.</p>

                        <p>Were I to select the especial objects which, amidst the great<lb/>
                            variety that demanded his services, more particularly absorbed<lb/> his
                            attention, and occupied his deepest consideration, I might<lb/> dwell
                            upon his close devotion to the interests of the African; the<lb/>
                            promotion of the leading measures of the Manumission Society;<lb/> and
                            the enactment of laws for the final abolition of slavery in the<lb/>
                            state of New York. The education of the blacks, and the

                            of<lb/> his solicitude. The bettering the condition of the poor,
                            the<lb/> organization of the Lancasterian free schools, and an
                            improved<lb/> code of prison discipline, were subjects which engrossed
                            most<lb/> of his time for many years; and I think you will find
                            many<lb/> documents among his papers, which evince his successful
                            efforts<lb/>to further these benevolent purposes.</p>
                        <p>The claims of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> to a lasting
                            consideration will, how-<lb/>ever, I think, rest mainly on the early
                            begun and long continued<lb/> zeal and abilities which he exhibited on
                            the subject of insanity,<lb/> and the unfortunate beings afflicted with
                            that calamity. At a<lb/> comparatively youthful period of his life, he
                            was appointed to the<lb/> duties of hospital direction; and he seems at
                            nearly the same<lb/> period to have turned his attention to the
                            treatment and hospital<lb/> discipline of those afflicted with mental
                            derangement. Our esta-<lb/>blishments for the better medical government
                            of lunacy were<lb/> then very few and imperfect. <placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsylvania</placeName> had indeed done<lb/> something—<placeName
                                key="nycit">New York</placeName> nothing. The public spirited
                            governors<lb/> of the <placeName key="newyh">New York
                                Hospital</placeName>, were induced from urgent represent¬<lb/>ations
                            made them, to erect a separate edifice on the hospital-<lb/> grounds for
                            the exclusive benefit of lunatics ; and this institution,<lb/> which
                            opened its doors in <date when="1808">1808</date>, under the
                            professional direction<lb/> of the late <persName key="dbruc1">Dr.
                                Bruce</persName>, for a while seemed to answer the benevo-<lb/>lent
                            intentions of the board of governors. It was, however, ere<lb/> long,
                            apparent that this city asylum was of too limited a capacity<lb/> for
                            the accommodation of its numerous applicants; nor was the<lb/>
                            receptacle itself of the character demanded for the afflicted and<lb/>
                            valuable beings of all ranks of society who became the inmates<lb/> of
                            it. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> had read much, and
                            thought much on the sub-<lb/>jects of mental derangement, on prison and
                            penitentiary discipline,<lb/> on the structure and economy of
                            mad-houses, and on the domestic<lb/> and sanative treatment of the
                            insane. His correspondence with<lb/><pb n="27" facs="SW_TE1834_025"/>several distinguished
                            characters abroad, favoured the accuracy<lb/> and accumulation of his
                            knowledge on these engrossing topics:<lb/> his intimate and free verbal
                            disquisitions on all these several<lb/> matters with that excellent man
                            and eminent philanthropist, the<lb/> late <persName key="jmurr1">John
                                Murray, jun.</persName> strengthened his views : he compared
                            the<lb/> facts thus derived from these several sources, with his
                            personal<lb/> experience at the city asylum of the <placeName
                                key="newyh">New York Hospital</placeName>, where<lb/> he was almost
                            daily engaged: the result was a firmer conviction<lb/> in him, that much
                            improvement might be made in the govern-<lb/>ment and remedial treatment
                            of mental derangement.</p>
                        <p> The writings and reports of <persName key="jhowa1">Howard</persName>, of
                            Ferriar, of Haygarth,<lb/> and of Lind, on prisons, fever hospitals, and
                            houses of recovery,<lb/> were the principal sources, whence, at that
                            time, information was<lb/> derived touching these momentous subjects;
                            and few looked fur-<lb/>ther for knowledge on the diseases of the mind
                            than to the pages<lb/> of Crighton, Haslam, Pinel, and Rush. It was
                            therefore with<lb/> no ordinary solicitude that the friends of humanity
                            in America<lb/> heard of the success which crowned the benevolent
                            exertions of<lb/> the Society of Friends, near <placeName key="york2"
                                >York</placeName>, in England, who had esta-<lb/>blished a Retreat
                            for the Insane, for the express purpose of insti-<lb/>tuting a milder
                            system of management than had previously been<lb/> employed. Some
                            account of the Retreat was published by <persName key="stuke1">Mr.
                                <lb/>Tuke</persName> in <date when="1813">1813</date>. <persName
                                key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> entered into a correspondence
                            with<lb/> that gentleman, in order to obtain more ample and precise
                            infor<lb/>mation than <persName key="stuke1">Mr. Tuke</persName>'s work
                            afforded. Shortly subsequent to<lb/> this date, the important
                            parliamentary investigations on the<lb/> management of the mad-houses of
                                <placeName key="gbrit">Great Britain</placeName> were
                            instituted;<lb/> and the elaborate reports which soon followed, embodied
                            such a<lb/> mass of facts, of indubitable authenticity and vital
                            consideration,<lb/> as left not a doubt in the minds of the most
                            sceptical, that perni-<lb/>cious errors widely prevailed on the nature
                            of insanity; that<lb/> gross evils and enormous barbarities were
                            inflicted on the unfor-<lb/>tunate victims of madness, as salutary and
                            requisite principles of<lb/> medical treatment; that in several of these
                            institutions, to the<lb/> miseries inseparable to a loss of reason, were
                            added the horrors<lb/> and atrocities of brutalized ignorance, refined,
                            if I may so say,<lb/> by the absurdest therapeutical doctrines which the
                            sophistry of<lb/> man ever invented. Happily, at the same time, these
                            investiga-<lb/>tions and inquiries, while they gave multiplied proofs of
                            frightful <lb/><pb n="28" facs="SW_TE1834_026"/>abuses, demonstrated that in numerous cases
                            mental alienation,<lb/> like many physical infirmities, strictly so
                            considered, was often<lb/> remediable; that to pronounce a condemnation
                            of the insane to<lb/> total incapability of medical relief in all after
                            life, was a decision<lb/> at variance with the strongest evidence of a
                            contrary character,<lb/> deduced from the results of the practice, not
                            only at the Retreat<lb/> at <placeName key="york2">York</placeName>, but
                            of the Asylums at <placeName key="notth">Nottingham</placeName>,
                                <placeName key="glasg">Glasgow</placeName>, and other<lb/> places ;
                            in short, that individuals who had lost health and reason,<lb/> might be
                            restored to both, by the judicious use of medicine, and<lb/> a mild
                            moral management.</p>
                        <p>Fortified with such testimony, <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                            Eddy</persName>'s zeal was quickened;<lb/> he united with several
                            eminent citizens among us, of whom I<lb/> may particularly notice the

                            <persName key="mclar1">General Clarkson</persName>, and the late

                            applica-<lb/>tion to our legislature for efficient means to enable the

                                Hospital</placeName>, to erect a suitable establishment<lb/> for the
                            insane, on a scite appropriate to such an object. The<lb/> result, was
                            the ample grant by the state of <placeName key="new yo">New

                            connected therewith. The<lb/> whole is a proud trophy of <persName
                                key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s laudable perseverance;<lb/> while
                            the act by which it was secured, will ever remain conspi-<lb/>cuous
                            among the many which characterized the administration<lb/> of <persName
                                key="dclin1">Governor De Witt Clinton.</persName></p>
                        <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, in common with many other
                            benevolent individuals,<lb/> was at first disposed to place a more
                            entire reliance on the moral<lb/> management of insanity, to the
                            exclusion of all medical treat-<lb/>ment, than, I think, the facts in
                            the case warrant. This belief I<lb/> know, he for some time cherished;
                            but the enlarged experience<lb/> and personal observation which for many
                            years he afterwards<lb/> enjoyed at the noble institution which his own
                            efforts so power-<lb/>fully contributed to organize, led him to qualify
                            his views on the<lb/> curative means in lunacy. Having, while in

                            management and treatment of the insane constituted a<lb/> prominent

                                >Holland</placeName>, I became fully<lb/> convinced that those
                            asylums in which a prompt and judicious<lb/> medical practice was
                            adopted, afforded the largest favourable<lb/> results of the tractable
                            nature of many forms of diseased mani-<lb/>festations of mind: that such
                            indeed was the case even at the <lb/><pb n="29" facs="SW_TE1834_027"/>Retreat at <placeName

                            curative measures were<lb/> employed, and of consequence, recovery was

                                surpassed in cruelty an<lb/> example which presented itself to me of

                        <p> The evidence deduced from truths of this nature, and the

                            before his death, to adopt the opinion<lb/> that the proper

                            moral management, as of itself alone the essential means of<lb/> cure of
                            maniacal subjects. The delirium of inebriety, and the<lb/> more advanced

                            has repeatedly shown; but the<lb/> neglect of a distinct pathognomonic
                            difference between the<lb/> ravings of inebriety, or delirium tremens,
                            and mental derange<lb/>ment, strictly so considered, have led to gross
                            miscalculations in<lb/> our prognosis. As alcoholic insanity is
                            engendered in every<lb/> country where drunkenness prevails, it is
                            perhaps more fre-<lb/>quently seen in our <emph rend="italic"
                                >mixed</emph> population, than in that of <placeName key="euro"
                                >Europe</placeName>.<lb/> Hence we have sometimes been led to
                            pronounce hastily and<lb/> erroneously that our success in the
                            management of lunacy is<lb/> greater than that of other nations. We,
                            however, must be sup-<lb/>plied with more extensive and more accurate
                            tabular views of the<lb/> comparative results of practice, in different
                            institutions abroad and<lb/> at home, before we can come to a
                            satisfactory conclusion on this<lb/> contested head. It is cheering to
                            the feelings of the philanthro-<lb/>pist to know, that by remedial
                            measures, much more is accom-<lb/>plished at the present day, than was
                            at a former time imagined<lb/> practicable; and <persName key="teddy1"

                            the general organization of the canal policy at<lb/> that early stage of
                            this great undertaking, odious imputations<lb/> were freely bestowed
                            upon him and his compatriots, and with <lb/><pb n="31" facs="SW_TE1834_029"/>them he was
                            assailed with the weapons of ridicule, by an opposi-<lb/>tion thinly
                            scattered throughout the state, but strongly confede-<lb/>rated in this
                            city. It was absurdly proclaimed that <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName><lb/> would be utterly ruined by carrying into
                            effect the projected canal<lb/> measures. Notwithstanding the
                            provocations were many and<lb/> strong, he betrayed no evidences of
                            irritability or disquietude,<lb/> but, like primitive <persName
                                key="rbarc1">Barclay</persName>, sustained himself with an
                            unshaken<lb/> indifference, feeling assured that ignorance could not
                            long retain<lb/> its usurped powers, and that rancour, the offspring of
                            party hatred<lb/> and disappointed ambition, would in due time exhaust
                            itself by<lb/> the force of its own venom.</p>
                        <p> Little need be said touching the scholastic acquisitions of Mr.<lb/>
                            <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName>. All I believe he ever received
                            at school, was embraced in an<lb/> English elementary education. He,
                            however, deeply studied the<lb/> human character: as opportunities
                            occurred, he read on general<lb/> subjects of life and letters. He was
                            versed in profane and eccle-<lb/>siastical story, and might be deemed an
                            adept in Quaker annals,<lb/> from the History of Sewall down to Sarah
                            Grub's Journal.<lb/> Knowledge being higher prized for defence than
                            ornament, he<lb/> turned his information in these matters to an
                            advantageous dex-<lb/>terity, when he encountered, in his journey, that
                            marvellous im-<lb/>postor of the Shakers, <persName key="jwilk1">Jemima
                                Wilkinson</persName>, the elect lady, during<lb/> his tour of
                            observation as canal commissioner in <date when="1810">1810</date>. He
                            often<lb/> spoke of this incident with peculiar pleasure. His
                            researches<lb/> in polemical disquisitions made him often deprecate the
                            folly and<lb/> injurious tendency of sectarian controversy on religious
                            matters;<lb/> and confirmed him in the excellence of the more salutary
                            influ-<lb/>ence of the unsophisticated or orthodox doctrines, as he
                            termed<lb/> them, of the Society of Friends. Though these were his
                            views,<lb/> he felt that the intellectual culture of the Quakers was
                            behind<lb/> that of many other religious communities; and I am
                            persuaded<lb/> his desire to promote knowledge, made him often regret,
                            that<lb/> while the society to which he belonged had every reason
                            to<lb/> boast of its morality, philanthropy, and benevolence; it
                            neglected<lb/> too much the important advantages arising from the
                            support of<lb/> a literary order of men for the better education of its
                            youth.<lb/> Sound knowledge, he would say, subdues idleness, and
                            prevents<lb/> vacuity; and a disciplined mind enables the possessor to
                            conduct<lb/> himself with greater safety in the right way. It will
                            readily be<lb/><pb n="32" facs="SW_TE1834_030"/>allowed, that the ethics of Quakerism, while
                            they lead to the rejec-<lb/>tion of speculative principles, tend to the
                            acquisition of practical<lb/> facts ; and, however prone the mind may be
                            to theorize, it is some-<lb/>what hard for theory to usurp an undue
                            influence over a Quaker<lb/> judgment. <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName> might he fairly cited as an example, in<lb/>
                            illustration of what is now advanced. Hence I account for his<lb/>
                            indifference to works of fancy; poetry and prose were alike<lb/> perused
                            by him for the solid instruction they imparted; and he<lb/> read Dr.
                            Mitchill's translation of the piscatory stanzas of Sanna-<lb/>zarius,
                            and the lofty strains of Dryden, with similar emotions.</p>
                        <p> No book of modern times stood so high in his estimation, as<lb/> the
                            Letters on the Christian Religion, by Dr. Olinthus Gregory,<lb/> and he
                            exerted his influence in the diffusion of that admirable<lb/> work. As
                            his efforts in behalf of new plans, or modified pro-<lb/>jects,
                            generally quadrated with the usefulness to be derived from<lb/>
                            contemplated measures, he was in the constant habit of urging<lb/> the
                            economical precepts and moral sayings of Franklin, which<lb/> he often
                            embodied, as the soundest advice, in his confidential let-<lb/>ters to
                            those of his young friends, for whom he cherished a par-<lb/>ticular
                            regard. The intellectuality of Madame De Stael yielded<lb/> him less
                            gratification than the expositions of Hannah More;<lb/> and a higher
                            glow of feeling was enkindled in his breast by<lb/> Rumford on Cookery
                            and Stoves, than by Burke on the Sublime<lb/> and Beautiful. It is
                            almost superfluous to add, that you may re-<lb/>gard him as a decided
                                <emph rend="italic">utilitarian</emph>.</p>
                        <p>Of the various societies with which he was associated, he was<lb/> fairly
                            considered an operative member. Aware that business<lb/> might be well
                            debated, and yet badly managed; he rarely spoke<lb/> in a public body,
                            and when his opinions were demanded, he deli-<lb/>vered his remarks with
                            plainness, brevity, and pertinency. In the<lb/> social circle, his
                            conversation was more animated: as he had<lb/> mixed largely with
                            different classes of mankind, and abounded<lb/> in lively anecdotes, it
                            was often highly interesting. On occa-<lb/>sions, he evinced a wholesome
                            intrepidity and an enlarged cha-<lb/>rity; yet he wished every thing
                            congenerous with the practical,<lb/> and he saw with little satisfaction
                            the diffusion of philippics<lb/> against luxurious living among a people
                            subsisting mainly on<lb/> the precarious tenure of the chase, and
                            tractates on extravagance<lb/> in dress among those whose chief vesture
                            was a blanket. </p>

                        <p>I need not enlarge. I think you may safely assent to the
                            con-<lb/>clusion, that the subject of your biography appropriated the
                            best<lb/> years of a long life to the best purposes of man; that he may
                            be<lb/> justly deemed enlightened, among a people whose frugal
                            views<lb/> occasion perhaps too partial and too low an estimation of
                            intellec-<lb/>tual acquirements; that he was eminently conspicuous in
                            a<lb/> society deservedly regarded as excelling all others in works of
                            <lb/>charity and philanthropy.</p>
                        <p> I am acquainted with but one striking instance in his whole life<lb/> in
                            which the integrity of his judgment was seriously impugned:<lb/> he was
                            unwittingly captivated by the enthusiasm which prevailed<lb/> concerning
                            the metallic tractors, and was led to confide in the<lb/> remedial
                            efficacy of Perkinism, by experiments instituted at the <lb/><placeName
                                key="newyh">New York Hospital</placeName>, where that practice was
                            countenanced for a<lb/> short while by certain of the physicians of that
                            charity. But<lb/> little censure can rest with him on this particular
                            account: he<lb/> was not educated a physician ; and this extraordinary
                            deception <lb/>received the support of many eminent professional
                            characters, both<lb/> in <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName> and
                            America, and indeed was not completely exploded<lb/> as an unwarrantable

                        <p>A word or two on your inquiry relative to his son <persName key="jeddy1"
                                >John Eddy</persName>.<lb/> I refer you to a short memoir of him
                            printed in the American<lb/> Monthly Magazine; more might have been said
                            of his know-<lb/>ledge of the physical branches of science, than is
                            there recorded.<lb/> He was a good zoologist, an excellent mineralogist,
                            and a minute<lb/> botanist. His acquisitions in this last named
                            department were<lb/> very remarkable. He was a member of the botanical
                            class when<lb/> I attended Columbia College in <date when="1809"
                                >1809</date>-<date when="1810">10</date>. But it was requisite,<lb/>
                            on account of his being a deaf-mute, that his studies should be<lb/>
                            prosecuted privately by the intervention of signs and the manual<lb/>
                            alphabet. He found a friend willing to give him the necessary<lb/>
                            direction and aid, in his relative, the professor of Botany, <persName
                                key="dhosa1">Dr.<lb/> Hosack</persName>. By visible signs, instead
                            of accentible sounds, he mas-<lb/>tered the Linnean system, and
                            subsequently became a practical<lb/> botanist. He formed an herbarium of
                            some extent, of our indi-<lb/>genous plants. The greater acuteness of
                            the surviving senses<lb/> when one or more are destroyed, was verified
                            in the case of <persName key="jeddy1">John<lb/>Eddy</persName>. His

                            incredible to those who are unaware what intellectual<lb/> power and

                <p>AT no period in the history of nations has the mind<lb/> of man been more active
                    in the great business of<lb/> ameliorating his condition, than that which has
                    elap-<lb/>sed since the close of the American revolution. Inven-<lb/>tion,
                    industry, and enterprise, have been abroad, and<lb/> multiplied conveniences,
                    comforts, and even elegan-<lb/>cies, beyond enumeration. Nor has this been
                    all:<lb/> Those charitable institutions, which are, at the same<lb/> time, the
                    medicine for natural and moral evils, and the<lb/> noble ornaments of civil
                    society, have every where been<lb/> built up, but especially in this country;
                    and it<lb/> is not too much to say, that, in many instances, our<lb/>
                    institutions have become patterns for other nations,<lb/> even those of the old
                    world, from which, in other<lb/> things, we have taken so much in organizing
                    societies<lb/> amongst ourselves. These institutions although of<lb/> the first
                    importance to the public welfare, seem to lie<lb/> out of the path of the
                    general historian, who contents<lb/> himself with some cursory remarks upon them
                    as<lb/> domestic matters, and goes on to battles, treaties,<lb/> and political
                    occurrences, as making up all that is worthy <lb/><pb n="38" facs="SW_TE1834_035"/>the attention of
                    the reader, or proper for his pen;<lb/> and, it is singular, that the writers of
                    biography should<lb/> have so seldom taken up the lives of philanthropists.<lb/>
                    Almost every grade of society, and every adventurer,<lb/> has been described,
                    while those who laboured for the<lb/> good of mankind have been, with some few
                    excep-<lb/>tions, neglected. The reading world have been sup-<lb/>plied with
                    countless volumes written upon the deeds<lb/> of warriors, who have desolated
                    nations, and marked<lb/> their footsteps with blood. In the opinion of men,<lb/>
                    they had conquered their fame:<lb/>
                    <quote type="poem"> They were the mighty of the world,<lb/> The demi-gods of earth;<lb/>
                        Their breath—the flag of blood unfurled <lb/>And gave the battle birth.<lb/>
                        They lived—to trample on mankind,<lb/> And in their ravage leave behind<lb/>
                        The impress of <emph rend="italic">their</emph> worth.<lb/> And wizzard
                        rhyme, and hoary song,<lb/> Hallowed their deeds, and hymned their
                        wrong.</quote><lb/>The statesmen and orators, as well as warriors, have<lb/>
                    had their Plinys and their Plutarchs to hand them<lb/> down to posterity in a
                    blaze of glory; and even the<lb/> poets who were neglected while living, have
                    had their<lb/> Cibbers and Johnsons to tell the world how they suf-<lb/>fered
                    and how they sung; while the philanthropist,<lb/> whose deeds have an influence
                    on the moral world,<lb/> as the dews of heaven have upon the natural, has<lb/>
                    hardly found a poet or historian. Not even a name<lb/> has been left on record
                    for the good Samaritan. In<lb/> a few instances, it is true, genius and feeling
                    have<lb/> burst out into a sweet strain of honest eulogy of the<lb/> benevolent,
                    such as will never be forgotten. Pope's<lb/> tuneful tribute to the Man of Ross,
                    and Burke's<lb/> eloquent description of <persName key="jhowa1"
                        >Howard</persName>, can never be lost.<lb/> Some, in modern times, have
                    sketched the lives of a<lb/> few philanthropists, but frequently in so tame a
                    man-<lb/>ner, that one would think that there was a canon<lb/> against showing
                    the slightest enthusiasm in com-<lb/>memorating the good. Some few have broken
                    through<lb/> their shackles, and dared to assign them a place in the<lb/><pb
                        n="39" facs="SW_TE1834_036"/>history of man, and to say to these doers of good in<lb/> a spirit
                    of prophecy,<lb/>
                    <quote type="poem">Thine was an empire o'er distress;<lb/> Thy triumph—of the
                        mind;<lb/> To burst the bonds of wretchedness,<lb/> The friend of human
                        kind:<lb/> Thy name—through every future age,<lb/> By bard, philanthropist,
                        and sage,<lb/> In glory shall be shrined.</quote>
                    <lb/>But these honest chroniclers have as yet had no chance<lb/> with the
                    delineators of warriors and statesmen, who<lb/> had astonished, awed, and
                    charmed mankind. It is<lb/> believed that a day of better taste is dawning
                    upon<lb/> us, and that men will take as much pleasure in tra-<lb/>cing the rise
                    and progress of an asylum for the chil-<lb/>dren of poverty and disease, as in
                    recounting a battle <lb/>in which thousands were made miserable, and which<lb/>
                    created many orphans at a blow.</p>
                <p>Promiscuous charity has been practised by the<lb/> kind-hearted and the wealthy
                    in every age and nation.<lb/> The benevolent have poured the oil and wine
                    into<lb/> the wounds of the unfortunate, to assuage their<lb/> anguish, if they
                    could not heal them; they have fed<lb/> the hungry and clothed the naked, and in
                    so doing<lb/> have received their reward in the blessings of the<lb/> just. The
                    Saviour of the world declared that, inas-<lb/>much as this was done to one of
                    the children of<lb/> misfortune, it was done unto himself. But
                    notwith-<lb/>standing this generous current of philanthropy has<lb/> been
                    flowing in the hearts of the virtuous, in all<lb/> nations, since the birth of
                    man, yet it was left for a<lb/> late age to collect facts relative to human
                    misery, and<lb/> from these to form a system for permanent relief.<lb/> In
                    former times, charity seemed to pour out her heart<lb/> like water, but never to
                    consult reason upon the true<lb/> means of preventing the evils she mourned. In
                    this<lb/> age she has called in industry, sagacity, perseverance,<lb/> and the
                    highest order of invention, to assist her in<lb/> her great undertakings.</p>
                <p> Prisons, in every age and nation, have been viewed <lb/><pb n="40" facs="SW_TE1834_037"/> with horror
                    by the great mass of the people; their<lb/> bars and gates and chains have been
                    so intimately<lb/> associated with crime and infamy, that the blood<lb/> curdled
                    at the very thought of them, and the shortest<lb/> confinement was a lasting
                    disgrace; and no wonder,<lb/> for within the four walls, and frequently in the
                    same<lb/> room, the murderer, the thief, the insane, and the<lb/> honest debtor,
                    mingled their wailings, and breathed<lb/> the same tainted atmosphere. It seemed
                    as if the<lb/> powerful and the benevolent were paralyzed in con-<lb/>templating
                    these evils, and thought the slightest<lb/> remedy was beyond all hope. They
                    could do some-<lb/>thing to soften the miseries of the individual, but
                    dared<lb/> not combat the prejudices of the age, nor attempt to<lb/> form a
                    general system to reach a class of cases.</p>
                <p> About the middle of the last century, a philanthro-<lb/>pist arose in <placeName
                        key="engl">England</placeName>, who gave a new direction to<lb/> the alms of
                    individuals, to the sympathy of communi-<lb/>ties, and to the charity of
                    nations. This philanthro-<lb/>pist was <persName key="jhowa1">John
                        Howard</persName>.* <note rend="asterisk">* See Appendix.</note> He was a
                    man of strict<lb/> habits, of daring courage, both natural and moral.<lb/> He
                    began, as it was then considered, a crusade of<lb/> charity. He examined the
                    state of all the prisons in<lb/>
                    <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> and <placeName key="wales"
                        >Wales</placeName>, and then extended his researches<lb/> through the
                    continent. He made known his disco-<lb/>veries to the grand inquest of the
                    British nation, the<lb/> House of Commons. This august body heard the<lb/>
                    relation with surprise, and set about turning the infor-<lb/>mation they had
                    gained to alleviating miseries, which<lb/> until then had appeared as among
                    legendary tales<lb/> or incurable evils. <persName key="jhowa1"
                        >Howard</persName> was still indefatigable<lb/> in his new pathway of glory,
                    and at last fell a martyr<lb/> to his zeal in the cause, on the banks of the
                    Euxine.<lb/> His exertions, however, were so bold and novel, as to<lb/> excite
                    general attention, and to give a new impulse<lb/> to the charitable dispositions
                    of the human mind.<lb/> He was indeed born for the universe, and the effects
                    of<lb/> his exertions are pervading the whole of Christendom. </p>
                <pb n="41" facs="SW_TE1834_038"/>
                <p>America has been so intimately connected with<lb/>
                    <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> in science and letters, that all that
                    has been<lb/> done in that country, was soon known in this, and<lb/> has
                    generally been imitated, when found to be good;<lb/> at first, by small
                    beginnings, which were, from time<lb/> to time, increased and improved, as
                    information and<lb/> wealth advanced. The privations and sufferings of<lb/> a
                    new people, taught them to be kind to one another,<lb/> and gave them the habits
                    as well as the spirit of<lb/> benevolence. It might, of course, have been
                    expected<lb/> by the patriot and philosopher, that <persName key="jhowa1"
                        >Howard</persName> would<lb/> have a school in America. This school has
                    been<lb/> established.</p>
                <p> One of the most distinguished disciples of this<lb/> university of charity, was
                        <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>, a merchant<lb/> of the city
                    of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>. He was born about the<lb/>
                    period that <persName key="jhowa1">Howard</persName> began to mark out his
                    course of<lb/> action. <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName> not only made this
                    great philanthro-<lb/>pist his pattern, but he carried his reasonings
                    farther<lb/> than <persName key="jhowa1">Howard</persName> had an opportunity to
                    do. Seizing the<lb/> facts and reasonings which <persName key="jhowa1"
                        >Howard</persName> had furnished,<lb/> he added others, truly his own, and
                    set about to<lb/> influence his fellow citizens to make practical efforts<lb/>
                    to test the correctness of his views, and the sound-<lb/>ness of his principles;
                    and such was his success, that<lb/> he, by general consent, received the
                    appellation of<lb/> the <said who="undetermined"><persName key="jhowa1"
                            >HOWARD</persName> OF AMERICA.</said> Some notice of the life,<lb/>
                    writings, and deeds of such a man, it is believed, will<lb/> not only be
                    acceptable, but useful to the public, as<lb/> an incentive to like efforts, and
                    as a satisfactory proof<lb/> of what can be done among men by one
                    individual<lb/> of intelligence, virtue, and moral courage.</p>
                <p> If, in later life, it is difficult for a man to speak of<lb/> himself and his
                    deeds, particularly, if he has been<lb/> called to take a conspicuous part on
                    the stage of<lb/>action; still, that autobiography of such a man which
                    <lb/>recounts the deeds and trials of childhood and youth,<lb/>and so far into
                    manhood as to come up to the time<lb/> when distinction commences, is always the
                    best, when <lb/><pb n="42" facs="SW_TE1834_039"/>it can be obtained. Fortunately, a plain,
                    modest,<lb/> and well written account of the early days of <persName
                        key="teddy1">Thomas<lb/> Eddy</persName>, has been left from his own hand.
                    It was only<lb/> intended for the eye of his family and particular<lb/> friends,
                    but the narrative is so happy, that it would<lb/> be over fastidious indeed to
                    hesitate to use it on this<lb/> occasion. It is almost impossible for a
                    biographer,<lb/>even with every aid before him, to describe the true<lb/> growth
                    and development of a mind, from the cradle to<lb/> maturity. The individual
                    himself can alone approx-<lb/>imate to the truth. In childhood and youth,
                    when<lb/> the imagination wanders at will, none but the per-<lb/>son himself can
                    tell all the avenues and directions of<lb/> thought, nor precisely when passion
                    was commingled<lb/> with judgment, or by what food and exercise the<lb/> mind
                    obtained its stature. I shall, as the best thing<lb/> that can be done for my
                    readers, introduce an extract,<lb/> in Mr. Eddy's own words, giving an account
                    of him-<lb/>self up to the time he began his effectual efforts as<lb/> a
                    philanthropist:—</p>

                            <placeName key="belfa">Belfast</placeName>, and there my father pursued
                            mercantile busi-<lb/>ness. They had both been educated
                            Presbyterians,<lb/> but during their residence in that city, he
                            became<lb/> acquainted with <persName key="rbrad1">Robert
                                Bradshaw</persName>, a Friend, of consi<lb/><pb n="43" facs="SW_TE1834_040"/>derable
                            estate, who resided at Newtonards, about seven<lb/> miles from
                                <placeName key="belfa">Belfast</placeName>, and was highly respected
                            and<lb/> much beloved. He was not a minister, but a meeting<lb/> was
                            held at his house, which was occasionally attend-<lb/>ed by some of his
                            tenants. He lent my father some<lb/> Friend's books, who in this way
                            became acquainted<lb/> with their principles, and was received as a
                            member<lb/> in the society. My mother was warmly attached to the<lb/>
                            Presbyterians, and much prejudiced against the doc-<lb/>trines and
                            principles of Friends; however, she after-<lb/>wards became convinced of
                            their rectitude, and was<lb/> received into membership. She was a pious
                            and valua-<lb/>ble woman. About the year <date when="1753">1753</date>,
                            they embarked for<lb/> America, and landed and settled at <placeName
                                key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. My<lb/> father pursued
                            mercantile business, mostly in shipping,<lb/> till about <date

                            had six-<lb/>teen children, of whom none are now living, but my<lb/>
                            sister, <persName key="mhosa1">Mary Hosack</persName>, and myself. She
                            was only a few<lb/> months old at the time of our father's decease. I
                            was<lb/> born in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, <date
                                when="1758-09-05">5th of 9th month, 1758</date>. My<lb/> mother
                            carried on the hardware business extensively<lb/> after my father's
                            death, till the year <date when="1796">1796</date>, when she<lb/>
                            removed to <placeName key="bucki">Buckingham</placeName>, in <placeName
                                key="bucks">Bucks county</placeName>. She was<lb/> induced to quit
                            the city on account of the bitter spi-<lb/>rit of persecution of the
                            Whigs (the advocates of<lb/> American independence) against the Tories,
                            (so call-<lb/>ed on account of their attachment to the mother<lb/>
                            country;) and our family being of the latter descrip-<lb/>tion, we
                            suffered considerably from the opposite par-<lb/>ty. Schools were then
                            badly conducted, and many<lb/> of them broken up, on account of the
                            teachers being<lb/> Tories, so that I had but a poor chance of getting
                            an<lb/> education. All the learning I acquired was reading,<lb/>
                            writing, and arithmetic, as far as vulgar fractions.<lb/> As to grammar,
                            I could repeat some of its definitions<lb/> by rote, but was totally
                            ignorant of its principles.<lb/> About the year <date when="1771"
                                >1771</date>, my mother placed me as an ap-<lb/>prentice with
                                <persName key="jhosk1">John Hoskins</persName>, of <placeName
                                    key="burli">Burlington</placeName>, to learn<lb/><pb n="44" facs="SW_TE1834_041"/>the
                            tanning business, but owing to some misunder-<lb/>standing about my
                            learning the currying trade, I<lb/> did not continue with him more than
                            two years.<lb/> Public affairs were in a very unsettled state, and<lb/>
                            a great deal of bitterness and ill-will subsisted<lb/> amongst the
                            people, which produced much division<lb/> and strife between families
                            and near connexions,<lb/> who had heretofore lived in perfect peace and
                            har-<lb/>mony. The science of government was little under-<lb/>stood,
                            yet every bustling politician was a great man.<lb/> Many of the most
                            respectable citizens were opposed<lb/> to a separation from Great
                            Britain, yet all acknow-<lb/>ledged that the claims of the British
                            Parliament<lb/> were severe and unjust. Those opposed to
                            indepen-<lb/>dence conceived that more ought to have been done<lb/>to
                            obtain redress of grievances in a peaceable way,<lb/> without having
                            recourse to the shedding of blood.<lb/> Every one seemed to take a
                            decided and warm part,<lb/> and was attached, and marked as belonging to
                            one<lb/> or other of the two parties. It now appears very<lb/> clearly
                            to my mind, that it would have been more<lb/> wise and consistent with
                            the principles of Friends, if<lb/> they had more carefully avoided the
                            intemperate<lb/> political zeal, then manifested by all parties.
                            The<lb/> advice of George Fox, was for Friends to keep out<lb/> of all
                            civil commotions, &amp;c., as they are mostly car-<lb/>ried on in a
                            temper very opposite to the meek and<lb/> quiet spirit of the Gospel.
                            From the age of 16 to 20<lb/> years, my most particular and intimate
                            friends were<lb/>
                            <persName key="cmiff1">Charles Mifflin</persName> and <persName
                                key="wsave1">William Savary</persName>, with whom I<lb/> daily
                            associated. The former was well educated<lb/> and of a fine
                            understanding, with sound principles<lb/> and a marked integrity. The
                            latter was a most<lb/> valuable character, and a highly pleasing and
                            enter-<lb/>taining companion. We were all fond of such sub-<lb/>jects
                            and pursuits as were most likely to promote<lb/> mirth and pleasantry,
                            yet the wise and excellent<lb/> sentiments communicated to us by
                                <persName key="cmiff1">Charles Mifflin</persName><lb/> were one
                            means of preserving us from much harm;<lb/><pb n="45" facs="SW_TE1834_042"/>and happy would
                            it have been for me, if I had,<lb/> through life, more imitated his
                            excellent character.<lb/> He possessed fine literary talents, and as a
                            poet was<lb/> pleasing and instructive. His family connexions<lb/> were
                            wealthy, and generally fashionable. He, more<lb/> particularly, during
                            the latter part of his life, was a<lb/> truly religious and good man. Of
                                <persName key="wsave1">William Savary</persName>,<lb/> it would be
                            difficult for me to say too much. No<lb/> two persons could entertain a
                            more near and tender<lb/> regard and affection for each other, than
                            always<lb/> subsisted between us. He was a man of uncommon-<lb/>ly
                            strong mind, and good understanding. When<lb/> about 25 years of age, he
                            became a minister, and per-<lb/>haps there never was one more highly
                            esteemed and<lb/> beloved. He was admired by all classes, and
                            openly<lb/> opposed to every thing in the least marked with<lb/> bigotry
                            or superstition. As a preacher, he was in<lb/> the first rank. His
                            manner of delivery was pleasing<lb/> and solemn, his mind was cultivated
                            and improved,<lb/> and he was uncommonly liberal in his sentiments<lb/>
                            towards those of other societies. I have often thought<lb/> there never
                            was so nearly perfect a character, within<lb/> my knowledge, in our
                            society, and none that more<lb/> extensively inculcated and effectually
                            diffused, true,<lb/> practical, Christian principles. I could do no
                            less<lb/> than pay this brief tribute to the memory of these<lb/> two
                            excellent men, who were the friends of my<lb/> youth, and who early
                            instilled into my mind, opi-<lb/>nions and sentiments, that have been
                            instructive and<lb/> useful to me through life.</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1777">1777</date>, the British troops took possession of
                                <placeName key="phila">Phila-<lb/>delphia</placeName>, and soon
                            after their entering the city, the<lb/> American army attacked them at
                                <placeName key="germa">Germantown</placeName>. I<lb/> rode out with
                                <persName key="wsave1">William Savary</persName> to that place,
                            before<lb/> the battle was entirely over, and had a view, a
                            mourn-<lb/>ful view, of the killed and wounded on the ground.<lb/> When
                            we arrived, the Americans had retreated, and<lb/> the British army had
                            advanced as far as <placeName key="chehi">Chesnut<lb/> Hill</placeName>.

                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, a number of
                            Friends, amongst<lb/> whom was my elder brother <persName key="ceddy1"
                                >Charles</persName>, were arrested by<lb/> a general warrant, by
                            order of the <orgName key="excop">Executive Council<lb/> of
                                Pennsylvania</orgName>, and without being admitted to a<lb/>
                            hearing, were unjustly banished to <placeName key="winch"
                                >Winchester</placeName>, in<lb/> Virginia. Of this number, I
                            recollect the names of<lb/>
                            <persName key="ipemb1">Israel</persName>, <persName key="jpemb2"
                                >John</persName>, and <persName key="jpemb1">James

                            charge against them<lb/> was, that they were unfriendly to the
                            independence<lb/> of America. They were absent several months, and<lb/>
                            were allowed to return, during the time the British<lb/> occupied the

                                >6th month, 1778</date>. Soon after, several<lb/> persons were
                            arrested, under a charge of aiding the<lb/> British, and were tried for
                            treason. As is common<lb/> in all civil wars, the minds of people were
                            extremely<lb/> irritated against each other, and those who were<lb/>
                            attached to the British government, were often very<lb/> bitterly
                            persecuted by the opposite party. Amongst <lb/>those citizens of
                            Philadelphia charged with treason,<lb/> were <persName key="jrobe1">John

                                Carlisle</persName>. They<lb/> were both Friends of good reputation,
                            and very<lb/> respectable men. The former was a miller, and
                            resi-<lb/>ded near <placeName key="merio">Merion</placeName> meeting
                            house, about six miles from<lb/>
                            <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. The latter was a board
                            merchant,<lb/> near Vine street. The charge against <persName
                                key="jrobe1">Roberts</persName> was,<lb/> that when the British
                            troops were on their march to<lb/> take possession of <placeName
                                key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and had advanced<lb/> near
                            Swedes Ford, on the <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName>, 17
                            miles from<lb/> the city, he sent word to <persName key="whowe1">General
                                Howe</persName>, who com-<lb/>manded the British, that the Friends,
                            who, as afore-<lb/>mentioned, had been banished to <placeName

                            road to <placeName key="readi">Reading</placeName>, and suggested
                            to<lb/> the <persName key="whowe1">General</persName> that he should
                            send a detachment of the<lb/> army to fall in with them, in order that
                            they might<lb/> return to their families. After the British took
                            pos-<lb/>session of the city, a line of fortifications was
                            com-<lb/>pleted from the <geogName key="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> to
                            the <geogName key="delaw">Delaware</geogName>, and<lb/><pb n="47" facs="SW_TE1834_044"/>gates
                            were placed at different parts of this line. At<lb/> one of these gates,
                                <persName key="acarl1">Abraham Carlisle</persName> was stationed

                            constituted the charge exhibited against him. They<lb/> were both tried

                            which was very large. He was<lb/> extensively known, and much beloved.

                            preached, and I attended, as did a<lb/> large number from the city.

                            very large. When the British<lb/> troops evacuated <placeName

                            to <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>.<lb/> At this period it
                            was very dangerous travelling with-<lb/>out a passport. I was put over
                            to <placeName key="stati">Staten Island</placeName> (pos-<lb/>sessed by
                            the British troops) at night, and next day<lb/> reached <placeName
                                key="nycit">New York</placeName>. My brother <persName key="ceddy1"
                                >Charles</persName> had, some<lb/> time before, sailed for
                                <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>. I had sold my<lb/> horse
                            at <placeName key="rahwa">Rahway</placeName>, and had only ninety-six
                            dollars on<lb/> my reaching <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>,
                            where I was totally a stran-<lb/>ger, and as to a knowledge of any kind
                            of business,<lb/> entirely ignorant. My school learning, as I have
                            be-<lb/>fore mentioned, was very limited, so that, of course,<lb/> I had
                            to encounter many difficulties, and laboured<lb/> under great
                            disadvantage in my attempts to acquire<lb/> a sufficiency to defray my
                            expenses. I took board<lb/> with <persName key="wback1">William
                                Backhouse</persName>, in the house now occupied<lb/> by <persName

                            of<lb/>eight dollars per week, besides having to pay one<lb/> dollar
                            weekly for washing; <persName key="selai1">Samuel Elain</persName>, late of<lb/>
                            <placeName key="newpo">Newport</placeName>, deceased, <persName
                                key="jglov1">John I. Glover</persName>, and two or three<lb/> other
                            respectable merchants, boarded at the same<lb/> house; becoming
                            acquainted with them was highly<lb/> useful to me, as it was the first
                            opportunity I had<lb/><pb n="48" facs="SW_TE1834_045"/>ever had of acquiring a knowledge of
                            commerce,<lb/> and the course of mercantile dealing. I knew that<lb/> it
                            was out of my power to support myself with what<lb/> I then possessed,
                            and that I must soon come to want,<lb/> unless I could succeed in
                            business. The first thing<lb/> to which my attention was turned, was
                            daily to<lb/> attend auctions at the Coffee House, and being
                            sen-<lb/>sible of my own ignorance, I endeavoured by every<lb/> means in
                            my power to acquire information—care-<lb/>fully inquiring of others the
                            names of articles ex-<lb/>posed for public sale, as it often happened
                            that I was<lb/> not even acquainted with the names of many of<lb/> them,
                            I then inquired their value, and advised with<lb/> some persons previous
                            to purchasing; sometimes on<lb/> noticing an article intended to be sold
                            by auction, I<lb/> would procure a sample, and call on some dealer
                            in<lb/> the article, and get them to offer me a fixed price on<lb/> my
                            furnishing it: in this way, by first ascertaining<lb/> where I could
                            dispose of the goods, I would purchase,<lb/> provided the price would
                            afford me a profit. On this<lb/>plan I have found a purchaser for goods,
                            bought and<lb/> delivered them, and received the money which
                            ena-<lb/>bled me to pay the auctioneer the cost of them, with-<lb/>out
                            my advancing one shilling. I was obliged to<lb/>live by my wits, and
                            this necessity was of great use<lb/> to me afterwards. Some months after
                            my arrival at<lb/>
                            <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, my brother <persName
                                key="ceddy1">Charles</persName> arrived from <placeName key="irel"
                                >Ireland</placeName>,<lb/> and brought with him, on account of
                            merchants there,<lb/> provisions, linens, &amp;c. shipped from
                                <placeName key="dubli">Dublin</placeName>, Cork,<lb/>
                            <placeName key="belfa">Belfast</placeName>, and other ports. He returned
                            to <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName> in<lb/>
                            <date when="1780">1780</date>, previous to which we formed a
                            copartnership<lb/> with <persName key="bsyke1">Benjamin
                            Sykes</persName>, under the firm of Eddy, Sykes, &amp; Co.</p>
                        <p> This firm prosecuted business mostly in consign-<lb/>ments from
                                <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> and <placeName key="irel"
                                >Ireland</placeName>, and some shipping<lb/> business. My partner
                            was a good natured honest<lb/> Englishman, but not possessed of a very
                            intelligent,<lb/> active mind; in consequence of this, the
                            management<lb/> and contrivance of the business fell to my lot, and,
                            <lb/><pb n="49" facs="SW_TE1834_046"/>though very young, and without experience, I
                            had<lb/> to write all the letters, and carry on every kind
                            of<lb/>correspondence, besides mostly making all the pur-<lb/>chases and
                            sales. By every packet we had to write<lb/> twenty or thirty letters to
                                <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> and <placeName key="irel"
                                >Ireland</placeName>, and<lb/> to accomplish this, had frequently to
                            sit writing till<lb/> 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. I was
                            sedulously<lb/> and actively employed in business, and in this way<lb/>
                            acquired considerable knowledge of commercial af-<lb/>fairs. Our
                            concerns were extensive, and were prose-<lb/>cuted with tolerable
                            success, respectability, and repu-<lb/>tation. My brother <persName
                                key="geddy1">George</persName> was, at this time, in<lb/>
                            <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, about 18 years of age.
                            He possessed a<lb/> remarkably sensible and comprehensive mind.
                            Al-<lb/>though he had no knowledge of business, he was<lb/> full of
                            enterprise. By him, in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>,
                            and by<lb/> Eddy, Sykes &amp; Co. in <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>, an arrangement<lb/> was made, with the consent of
                                <persName key="gwash1">General Washington</persName>,<lb/> to supply
                            the British and foreign troops with money,<lb/> who were taken with
                                <persName key="ccorn1">Lord Cornwallis</persName> at <placeName
                                key="yorkt">York<lb/> Town</placeName>. The money was raised by my
                            brother at<lb/>
                            <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, drawing on us at
                                <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, and the<lb/>monies thus
                            raised were paid to the Paymaster of<lb/> the British and foreign
                            troops, prisoners at <persName key="lanca">Lancas-<lb/>ter</persName>,
                                <persName key="penns">Pennsylvania</persName>, for which he received
                            and sent to<lb/> Eddy, Sykes &amp; Co. that Paymaster's drafts on
                            the<lb/> Paymaster General at <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>. By an agreement<lb/> made with <persName
                                key="hclin1">Sir Henry Clinton</persName>, the British
                            commander,<lb/> we were paid six per cent. commission. The whole<lb/>
                            amount paid amounted to a very large sum, and<lb/> proved a profitable
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>After being some time in business, I kept house in<lb/> John street. My
                            most intimate friends, at this time,<lb/> were <persName key="rhart1"
                                >Richard</persName> and <persName key="lhart1">Lawrence
                                Hartshorne</persName>. I had<lb/> formed some acquaintance with
                                <persName key="lhart1">Lawrence Harts-<lb/>horne</persName>'s sister
                            previous to my coming to <placeName key="nycit">New
                            York</placeName>,<lb/> and then experienced a tender and warm
                            attachment<lb/> towards her, and about a year after my coming to<lb/>
                            <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, I went down to <placeName
                                key="sandh">Sandy Hook</placeName> in company <lb/><pb n="50" facs="SW_TE1834_047"/>with
                                <persName key="lhart1">Lawrence Hartshorne</persName>, whose object
                            in attempt-<lb/>ing this dangerous enterprise was to visit his
                            parents,<lb/> whilst mine was to obtain an interview with his<lb/>
                            sister. In the evening, we immediately ventured on<lb/> shore, and went
                            to his father's, who resided on his<lb/> farm at Black Point. The family
                            were all in bed,<lb/> and we were thus disappointed in seeing any
                            of<lb/> them. <persName key="lhart1">Lawrence</persName> was advised by
                            his father to return<lb/> immediately to <placeName key="sandh">Sandy
                                Hook</placeName>, as there was reason to<lb/> suspect that parties
                            of the militia were then near the<lb/> premises. We accordingly went to
                            the river side,<lb/> and taking a small canoe, pushed off in hopes
                            of<lb/> getting safe to the <placeName key="sandh">Hook</placeName>; it
                            was moonlight, and as<lb/> we kept off some distance from the shore, we
                            did<lb/> not apprehend danger till we should reach the Gut<lb/> (as it
                            was called) which separated <placeName key="sandh">Sandy
                                Hook</placeName> from<lb/> the Highlands. This was very narrow, so
                            that we <lb/>were obliged to pass within a little distance of the<lb/>
                            <geogName key="jshor">Jersey shore</geogName>. There were stationed
                            about thirty of<lb/> the Jersey militia, and a number of them fired on
                            us.<lb/> We laid ourselves on our backs in the bottom of the<lb/> canoe,
                            and some of the balls went through the sides,<lb/> immediately over our
                            bodies. Finding we could not<lb/> escape, we rowed to the shore, and
                            surrendered our-<lb/>selves prisoners. At first, they treated us
                            harshly,<lb/> searched us, and took from us some articles of small<lb/>
                            value. In the morning they marched us to <placeName key="middl"
                                >Middle-<lb/>town</placeName>, and then to <placeName key="monmo"
                                >Monmouth</placeName> Court-house, where we<lb/> were taken before
                                <persName key="jsymm1">Judge Symmes</persName> (the father of
                                <lb/><persName key="csymm1">Capt. Symmes</persName>) and committed
                            to prison. We were<lb/> put in a small room, about six or seven feet
                            square,<lb/> in which we found four or five prisoners, some of <lb/>whom
                            had been confined there some time. We were<lb/> much crowded, and had
                            nothing to lie on but ex-<lb/>tremely dirty straw, which I believe had
                            not been<lb/> changed since the other prisoners had occupied the<lb/>
                            room. On first entering this miserable dungeon, the<lb/> stench
                            occasioned by foul and noxious air exceedingly<lb/> alarmed me, and it
                            was strongly fixed on my mind<lb/><pb n="51" facs="SW_TE1834_048"/>that it would put an end
                            to my life in less than half<lb/> an hour. However, in time, it did not
                            feel so very<lb/> offensive, and becoming habituated to it, I was
                            able<lb/> to eat my meals with a good appetite.</p>

                            then commissary of prisoners;<lb/> I consulted with him, and he behaved
                            very friendly<lb/> towards me. One day, it was reported that a
                            woman<lb/>had offered to swear that she had seen me, a short<lb/> time
                            before this, at <placeName key="newbr">New Brunswick</placeName>. This
                            was false,<lb/> as I had not been out of <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName> for more than a<lb/> year. It was said, if she
                            would swear I was there,<lb/> it would enable them to prove me a spy.
                            This served,<lb/> of course, to alarm me extremely; however, in a
                            little<lb/> time, no more was said about it. We remained in<lb/> this
                            loathsome place about eight or ten days, and<lb/> were then removed to
                                <placeName key="sprin">Springfield</placeName>, six miles from<lb/>
                            <placeName key="eliza">Elizabethtown</placeName>. At <placeName
                                key="sprin">Springfield</placeName>, we had the liberty<lb/>of a
                            mile round the village, and in about a month,<lb/> were exchanged for, I
                            believe, two soldiers of the<lb/> militia, and returned safe to our
                            friends in <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>.<lb/> Soon after
                            this, <persName key="heddy1">Hannah Hartshorne</persName> came to the
                            city<lb/> on a visit to her brother, which afforded me frequent<lb/>
                            opportunities of being in her company, and resulted<lb/> in our forming
                            an affectionate and lasting attach-<lb/>ment towards each other. We were
                            married on the<lb/><date when="1782-03-20">twentieth of 3d month,
                                1782</date>, at the old Meeting<lb/> House in Liberty street. I
                            continued in business till<lb/> peace was concluded in <date when="1783"
                                >1783</date>, and in the <date when="1783-11">11th month</date><lb/>
                            of that year, the British troops evacuated the city.<lb/> This was a
                            trying period to myself, and others, who<lb/> had taken refuge in
                                <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, as all persons of
                            our<lb/> description had thereby incurred the ill-will of those<lb/> of
                            the opposite party, and we much feared that we<lb/> should be
                            exceedingly persecuted by them. Great<lb/> numbers went to <placeName
                                key="novas">Nova Scotia</placeName>, and amongst others,<lb/> my
                            brother in law, <persName key="lhart1">Lawrence Hartshorne</persName>,
                            and his<lb/> family. I could not reconcile leaving my mother and<lb/>
                            near connexions in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and
                            this considera- <lb/><pb n="52" facs="SW_TE1834_049"/>tion prevented my removing to
                                <placeName key="halif2">Halifax</placeName>. It may now<lb/> appear
                            strange, that persons born in America, should<lb/> have been opposed to
                            American independence. It is,<lb/> however, not surprising, that among
                            the great body of<lb/> the people, who were all born and educated <emph
                                rend="italic">British<lb/> subjects</emph>, that many deep-rooted
                            prejudices should<lb/> exist, tending to excite an attachment to that
                            govern-<lb/>ment, and an aversion to republicanism.</p>
                        <p>These were sensible of the unjust and tyrannical<lb/> conduct of Great
                            Britain towards this country, but<lb/> they conceived redress of
                            grievances might be ob-<lb/>tained without a separation.</p>
                        <p>This, as events proved, was a vain expectation. In<lb/> truth, the
                            science of government was not then so well<lb/> understood as at
                            present, and great numbers, having<lb/> the knowledge they now possess,
                            would then have<lb/> adopted very different political sentiments.
                            This<lb/> would certainly have been the fact as regards myself.<lb/>
                            Before the Americans entered the city, I removed to<lb/>
                            <placeName key="newje">New Jersey</placeName>, and soon after to
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. My<lb/> brother
                                <persName key="ceddy1">Charles</persName> was married and in
                            business in <placeName key="lond">Lon-<lb/>don</placeName>, and I formed
                            a connexion in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>,
                            un-<lb/>der the firm of <persName key="teddy1">Thomas</persName> and
                                <persName key="geddy1">George Eddy</persName>. In the<lb/>
                            <date when="1784-01">first month of 1784</date>, I went to <placeName
                                key="virgi">Virginia</placeName> for the pur-<lb/>pose of purchasing
                            and making shipments of tobacco.<lb/> It was a most remarkably severe
                            winter, and I recol-<lb/>lect when riding near <placeName key="proya"
                                >Port-Royal</placeName> on the <geogName key="rappa"
                                >Rappahanock<lb/> river</geogName>, that the snow along the fences
                            (drifted) was<lb/> six feet deep. The winter in <date when="1780-01">1st
                                month, 1780</date>, was,<lb/> however, much more severe. All the bay
                            of <placeName key="nycit">New<lb/> York</placeName> was then frozen, for
                            some weeks, as far as <placeName key="sandh">San-<lb/>dy
                                Hook</placeName>. Horses and sleighs passed from the city<lb/> to
                                <placeName key="stati">Staten Island</placeName>. I remember seeing
                            a number of<lb/> large cannon, 42 pounders, taken on the ice from<lb/>
                            <placeName key="paulu">Paulus' Hook</placeName> or <placeName

                                Island</placeName>. Great<lb/> numbers of people were daily skating
                            on the bay. I<lb/> went on skates to <placeName key="gover">Governor's

                        <p>During the revolutionary war, tobacco, in <placeName key="euro"
                            >Europe</placeName>, <lb/><pb n="53" facs="SW_TE1834_050"/>sold at a very extravagant
                            price, in consequence of<lb/> which considerable quantities were shipped
                            within<lb/> a year after the peace, so that the market was
                            over-<lb/>stocked, and the price so reduced, that much money<lb/> was
                            lost by the shippers; my brother and myself lost<lb/> considerable. When
                            peace took place, there were<lb/> scarce any European goods on hand,
                            which occasion-<lb/>ed large importations to be made by our
                            merchants.<lb/> The ill effects of this began to be severely felt in<lb/>
                            <date when="1786">1786</date> to <date when="1788">1788</date>, which
                            ruined many in America and<lb/><placeName key="lond">London</placeName>.
                            Almost the whole of the American trade<lb/> was then confined to
                                <placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, and very little
                            com-<lb/>mercial intercourse with any other port in <placeName
                                key="engl">England</placeName>.<lb/> My brother <persName
                                key="ceddy1">Charles</persName> had shipped considerably on
                            credit<lb/> to <persName key="teddy1">Thomas</persName> and <persName
                                key="geddy1">George Eddy</persName>, and many others, who,<lb/>
                            owing to the country being inundated with every sort<lb/> of goods, were
                            unable to remit to <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>.
                            Thomas<lb/> and George Eddy, had supplied imprudently an
                            indi-<lb/>vidual residing at <placeName key="frede1"
                                >Fredericksburg</placeName>, <placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName>, with<lb/> goods to a large amount. He died,
                            and left his affairs<lb/> in a very unsettled state. On this account I
                            removed<lb/> with my family to <placeName key="frede1"
                                >Fredericksburg</placeName>, and kept a large<lb/> retail store in
                            the name of Thomas and George Eddy,<lb/> my brother <persName
                                key="geddy1">George</persName> remaining in <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>. This<lb/><placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName> business turned out badly, and my being<lb/>
                            much exposed to extravagant and dissipated company<lb/> was a great
                            injury to me in every respect. In <date when="1788">1788</date>,<lb/> I
                            returned to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and as my
                            brother in <placeName key="lond">Lon-<lb/>don</placeName> had failed, it
                            became necessary for Thomas and<lb/> George Eddy to make a settlement
                            with their cre-<lb/>ditors.</p>
                        <p>We were discharged under a general act of bank-<lb/>ruptcy for the State
                            of <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>. Since then,<lb/> the
                            debts due from them have been mostly paid.<lb/> Some were not legal
                            demands, and it was thought<lb/> not right to pay them.</p>
                        <p>I now had an opportunity of learning in the school<lb/> of adversity some
                            useful lessons, that have been of<lb/> advantage to me. 1 have often
                            looked back to this <lb/><pb n="54" facs="SW_TE1834_051"/>period, and recollected how much 1
                            lamented my mis-<lb/>fortune, as it is generally termed, but which,
                            indeed,<lb/> was a <quote>blessing in disguise,</quote> for, not
                            succeeding in<lb/> business in <placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName>, obliged me to remove, whereas,<lb/> had I
                            succeeded, I probably should have remained<lb/> there, and, considering
                            my weakness, how apt to<lb/> unite in company in every respect improper
                            and hurt-<lb/>ful to my best interests, moral and religious, there
                            is<lb/> every reason to suppose that I should have partaken<lb/> of all
                            the evils produced in such a profligate and<lb/> irreligious state of
                            society, as did then exist in <placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virgi-<lb/>nia</placeName>. I seldom reflect on the circumstances
                            which<lb/> forced me to leave that place, without feeling my<lb/> mind
                            warmed with a sense of gratitude to the All-<lb/> Wise Disposer of human
                            events, that he was gracious-<lb/>ly pleased so to extend his
                            providential care over me,<lb/> as to cause my removal from a state of
                            society that<lb/> might, by my remaining in it, have proved
                            destruc-<lb/>tive to my family, and ruinous to myself.</p>
                        <p>I omitted to mention, that on the <date when="1785-06-05">4th of 6th
                                month,<lb/>1785</date>, I embarked for <placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName> in the English ship<lb/> Mildred, bound for
                                <placeName key="lond">London</placeName>. I remained in <placeName
                                key="engl">England</placeName><lb/> only about three months, and
                            returned the latter part<lb/> of <date when="1785-11">11th month</date>,
                            being absent near six months. This<lb/> voyage was not productive of
                            much advantage to me.</p>
                        <p>In the year <date when="1790">1790</date>,1 went with my family to
                                <placeName key="blacp">Black<lb/> Point</placeName>, and in the
                            following year removed to <placeName key="nycit">New<lb/>
                                York</placeName>. On my return to this city, all 1 had was
                            fifty<lb/> pounds, supplied me by my father-in-law, but owing<lb/> to
                            the kind attention of <persName key="rbown1">Robert Bowne</persName>,
                            and others, I<lb/> soon got into some little business. At this
                            period,<lb/> and for some years afterwards, there were no
                            Insu-<lb/>rance offices in <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>,
                            and being encouraged by<lb/> my friends, I commenced the business of an
                            Insurance<lb/> broker. I pursued this with success for three or
                            four<lb/> years. About <date when="1792">1792</date>, the public debt of
                            the United<lb/> States was founded; this afforded an opportunity
                            for<lb/>people to speculate in the public funds. In this busi-<lb/>ness
                            I made a good deal of money. I declined acting <lb/><pb n="55" facs="SW_TE1834_052"/>as an
                            Insurance broker, and did considerable business<lb/> as an underwriter,
                            in which 1 was successful.</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1793">1793</date>, or <date when="1794">1794</date>, I was
                            elected a Director in the<lb/> Mutual Insurance Company, and soon after
                            a Director<lb/> in the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company, and<lb/>
                            in <date when="1797">1797</date>, was appointed Treasurer of that
                            Company.<lb/> From early life, all improvement of a public nature,<lb/>
                            that tended to benefit the country, or in any shape<lb/> promote the
                            happiness and welfare of mankind, were<lb/> considered by me as highly
                            important, and claimed<lb/> my attention. I have been connected with a
                            num-<lb/>ber of public institutions, and have providentially<lb/> been

                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, at this time, being in easy
                    circumstances,<lb/> had leisure to turn his attention to some of those<lb/>
                    charities that are of permanent benefit to mankind.<lb/> He had read the human
                    mind with great sagacity<lb/> and attention, and had analyzed the spirit of
                    society<lb/> in his own country. He found, as every wise man<lb/> will, that if
                    there are inevitable evils in the world,<lb/> yet much may be done by way of
                    softening them,<lb/> or preparing the mind to bear them.</p>
                <p>One of the first objects of his exertions was that<lb/> of establishing a
                    penitentiary in the State of <placeName key="newyo">New<lb/> York</placeName>,
                    for he believed that many who had been al-<lb/>lured to the paths of vice might
                    be recalled, if proper<lb/> methods were taken to instruct them in trades, to
                    give<lb/> them industrious habits, and to keep them from the <lb/>pollution of
                    those hardened in iniquity. He was<lb/> well acquainted with the general plan
                    and economy<lb/> of the penitentiary establishment in <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, <lb/>which had been got up by the influence of
                    the Soci-<lb/>ety of Friends, but he thought even this system was<lb/>
                    susceptible of improvement. No other state had then<lb/> followed the example of
                        <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>, nor had its<lb/> fame
                    reached the leading philanthropists of <placeName key="nycit">New<lb/>
                        York</placeName>. The penal code in most of the States still has<lb/> the
                    sanguinary spirit and hard features of the English<lb/> penal code, which, with
                    all their boasted love of <lb/><pb n="56" facs="SW_TE1834_053"/>liberty, was written in blood. The
                    tears of the sym-<lb/>pathetic, and the voice of the benevolent, had made<lb/>
                    but slow progress against the apathy of the great<lb/> mass of mankind, and the
                    vindictive spirit of a few,<lb/> who believe, or profess to believe, that the
                    world<lb/> should be governed by a rod of iron. The hearts of<lb/> the people
                    were made callous by the sight of stocks,<lb/> whipping-posts, pillories, in
                    every shire, town, or con-<lb/>siderable village. Flagellation with the
                    cat-o'-nine-<lb/> tails, burning in the hand, or forehead, with a hot<lb/> iron,
                    cropping the ears of prisoners in the pillory,<lb/> were all common sights to
                    the youngest, as well as<lb/> the oldest, portion of the community. The
                    Friends<lb/> in <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> were among the
                    first people in the<lb/> Union to make an effort to change this barbarity
                    for<lb/> some milder system, thinking, and thinking justly,<lb/> that severe
                    punishments produced, rather than dimi-<lb/>nished crime. To this order of
                    Christians the public<lb/> are indebted for many good examples; but if this<lb/>
                    was the only thing they had done for mankind, they<lb/> would deservedly stand
                    high with the historian. By<lb/> their efforts, the penal code of <placeName
                        key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> was<lb/> ameliorated, and this good
                    precedent has been fol-<lb/>lowed by most of the States in the Union.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1796">1796</date>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was
                    on a journey to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/> in company
                    with <persName key="pschu1">General Philip Schuyler</persName>, of the
                    State<lb/> of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>. <persName
                        key="pschu1">Schuyler</persName> was then a member of the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="nysen">Senate</orgName> of that State, and was, justly, very
                    influential.<lb/> He had been for more than forty years a prominent<lb/>
                    character in the country, first, as an officer in the war<lb/> of <date
                        when="1755">1755</date>, and then a magnanimous leader in the
                    revo-<lb/>lutionary contest. He had talents, integrity, property,<lb/> and moral
                    courage, and was the very man for the<lb/> purpose <persName key="teddy1"
                        >Eddy</persName> had in view, which was to engage him<lb/> in the change he
                    wished to bring about in the penal<lb/> code of the State of <placeName
                        key="newyo">New York</placeName>, and for the establish-<lb/>ment of a
                    penitentiary system. <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName> conversed
                    free-<lb/>ly with <persName key="pschu1">Schuyler</persName> upon every topic
                    that had a bearing<lb/> upon the subject, and as soon as they reached the city
                    <lb/><pb n="57" facs="SW_TE1834_054"/>of <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, they
                    repaired to the prison and made<lb/> a thorough examination of the edifice, the
                    convicts,<lb/> the by-laws, the whole economy of the establishment,<lb/> which
                    were satisfactory to that practical statesman<lb/>
                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> had laboured to engage in the cause,
                    and he<lb/> was now ready to go heart and hand with him. <persName key="teddy1"
                        >Mr.<lb/> Eddy</persName> procured a large number of copies of the
                    penal<lb/> code of <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and
                    distributed them freely.<lb/> To each of the members of the Legislature he
                    pre-<lb/>sented a copy, at the next meeting of that body, after<lb/> his visit
                    to <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. The <persName key="pschu1"
                        >General</persName>, with the as-<lb/>sistance of <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName>, drew up a bill for establishing<lb/> a penitentiary system
                    in the State of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>.<lb/> This bill he
                    did not introduce into the Senate him-<lb/>self, but engaged the services of a
                    distinguished<lb/> member of that body, <persName key="aspen1">Ambrose
                        Spencer</persName>,* <note rend="asterisk">* See Appendix.</note> a
                    gentleman<lb/> of first rate abilities, and who has since filled the<lb/>
                    important office of Chief Justice of the State of <placeName key="newyo">New
                        <lb/>York</placeName>, with high honour. Both <persName key="aspen1"
                        >Spencer</persName> and <persName key="pschu1">Schuy-<lb/>ler</persName>
                    made excellent speeches on the subject, which had<lb/> a surprising effect upon
                    the members of the <orgName key="nysen">Senate</orgName>,<lb/> and on the
                    audience. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was at hand to give<lb/>
                    all the details that were necessary for a proper<lb/> understanding of the
                    provisions of the bill. The<lb/> moment the representatives of the people were
                    con-<lb/>vinced of the utility and practicability of the mea-<lb/>sure, the bill
                    was passed without any great difficulty.<lb/> The bill directed a state prison
                    to be erected, and<lb/> appointed <persName key="mclar1">Matthew
                        Clarkson</persName>, <persName key="jwatt1">John Watts</persName>, <persName
                        key="teddy1">Thomas<lb/> Eddy</persName>, <persName key="istou1">Isaac
                        Stoutenburg</persName>, and <persName key="jmurr1">John Murray,
                        jun.</persName>,<lb/> commissioners to carry the bill into effect.
                    These<lb/> commissioners designated <persName key="teddy1">Thomas
                        Eddy</persName> as a com-<lb/>mittee for building the prison, who engaged
                    the<lb/> architect and workmen, and went on in his own way<lb/> with the whole
                    concern. This duty he set about to<lb/> perform, but imitated very closely the
                    plan of the<lb/> establishment at <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>; the plan of the single<lb/> rooms was an after
                    thought with <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, but <lb/><pb n="58" facs="SW_TE1834_055"/>which, in fact, is the great improvement of the age.<lb/> Such was <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s anxiety to have the penitenti-<lb/>ary
                    succeed, that he not only consented to serve as a<lb/> director, but as an
                    agent. He undertook the latter<lb/> office, as his reputation was involved in
                    the success<lb/> of the plan, and probably from an honest conviction<lb/> that
                    he had made himself better acquainted with<lb/> the whole subject than any other
                    person in the State.<lb/> In these two offices, as inspector and agent, he
                    acted<lb/> for more than four years. He was so assiduous and <lb/>calculating in
                    his duties, that every anticipation of<lb/> his friends and of himself was more
                    than realized.<lb/> The expenses of the establishment had been less<lb/> than
                    were expected, the health of the prisoners bet-<lb/>ter than that of the free
                    and honest citizens in the<lb/> ordinary walks of life. Such cleanliness, order,
                    and<lb/> moral discipline, marked the penitentiary system<lb/> under the
                    administration of this untired philanthro-<lb/>pist, that those formerly
                    dissipated and sickly were<lb/> made sober and healthy. He watched the results
                    of<lb/> his plans, and held to a theory no longer than he<lb/> found it good in
                    practice. His, was truly the induc-<lb/>tive system of philanthropy. In <date
                        when="1801">1801</date>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>
                    pub-<lb/>lished an account of the State Prison of <placeName key="newyo">New
                        York</placeName>.<lb/> His mottos were taken from Beccaria and
                    Montes-<lb/>quieu; in fact, his whole theory of crimes and pun-<lb/>ishments is
                    drawn from those great friends of liberty,<lb/> Beccaria, Montesquieu, <persName
                        key="jhowa1">Howard</persName>, <persName key="wpenn1">Penn</persName>, and
                    other<lb/> celebrated reformers of this and a former age. He<lb/> pointed out
                    the state of the penal code in <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName><lb/>
                    before <date when="1796">1796</date>, and showed, that after it was
                    altered,<lb/> diminishing the number of capital punishments,<lb/> and
                    substituting imprisonment, the humane change<lb/> was made without increasing
                    crime. In this work,<lb/>
                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> recounted the history of the
                    establish-<lb/>ment, described the edifice with its workshops, cells,<lb/>
                    &amp;c.; and no one can deny but that the plan was<lb/> admirable, according to
                    the state of information on<lb/> these subjects at that time. The government of
                    the<lb/><pb n="59" facs="SW_TE1834_056"/>prison is also treated of, its officers named, and
                    their<lb/> duties minutely pointed out. This, at present, would<lb/> seem
                    superfluous, but, at that time, it was a new<lb/> affair. The writer goes on to
                    give a full account<lb/> of the prisoners in the State, with the treatment,<lb/>
                    occupations, dress, and diet of the convicts, as also<lb/> the means used, and
                    to be used, for their reforma-<lb/>tion. On the subject of food and dress, he is
                    quite<lb/> minute; all of which goes to prove that cleanliness<lb/> is the great
                    promoter and preserver of health, and<lb/> that no effective labour can be
                    expected of men who<lb/> are not substantially and well fed. In fact, he
                    ap-<lb/>proves of the maxim of the stable, that <q><emph rend="italic">to
                            get la<lb/>bour from the animal, he should be kept under the full<lb/>
                            force of feed—good wholesome feed, however coarse.</emph></q><lb/>
                    Among these excellent statistics of the prison, there<lb/> is nothing to be
                    compared to his doctrines upon the<lb/> subject of reformation.</p>

                    <body>
                        <p>The end of human punishments is the prevention<lb/> of crimes. In the
                            endeavour to attain this end, three<lb/> things are to be considered:
                            the amendment of the<lb/> offender; the deterring of others by his
                            example;<lb/> reparation to society and the party injured. Of these<lb/>
                            objects, the first, without doubt, is of the highest<lb/> importance.
                            Society cannot be better secured against<lb/> crimes, than by
                            eradicating the evil passions and cor-<lb/>rupt habits which are the
                            sources of guilt. The <lb/>operation of punishment as a terror to
                            others, is gene-<lb/>rally considered as momentary and uncertain in
                            its<lb/> effects; for men are often found so regardless of the<lb/>
                            future, as to perpetrate crimes at the instant they are<lb/> witnessing
                            the most dreadful execution of a criminal<lb/> for a similar offence.
                            The punishment of death pre-<lb/>cludes the possibility of the amendment
                            of the crimi-<lb/>nal by any human means. Every hope of
                            reforma-<lb/>tion is at once cut off without a single effort to<lb/>
                            accomplish so just and benevolent a purpose. Society<lb/> and the
                            injured party are, indeed, in the strictest<lb/> sense, avenged on the
                            head of the guilty offender. <lb/><pb n="60" facs="SW_TE1834_057"/>Justice, however, not
                            revenge, is the true foundation<lb/> of the right of punishment. But, it
                            is not the design<lb/>of the present work to discuss the principles of a
                            <lb/>code of criminal law, or to point out the errors which<lb/> have
                            been perpetuated by the passions or ignorance<lb/>of legislators.</p>
                        <p>If society is effectually secured against future mis-<lb/>chief by the
                            imprisonment of the offender, it is that<lb/> mode of punishment also
                            which affords the only<lb/> chance of reclaiming him from evil. It is by
                            con-<lb/>finement to hard labour in a penitentiary house, that<lb/> the
                            primary and legitimate purpose of human punish-<lb/>ment is to be
                            effected. The character of men are<lb/> endlessly diversified, and their
                            motives and actions<lb/> assume a thousand different hues. In
                            considering<lb/> convicts, we may, in general, distinguish them
                            into<lb/> three classes: men grown old in habits of profligacy<lb/> and
                            violence, unfeeling and desperate offenders, who<lb/> discover no signs
                            of contrition, and yield little hope<lb/> of amendment: those who, in
                            early life, have received<lb/> a moral and religious education, and,
                            though after-<lb/>wards led by passion and evil example into the
                            com-<lb/>mission of crimes, still retain some sense of virtue:<lb/>
                            those who, have sustained a fair reputation, are<lb/> arrested for the
                            first public offence, before they have<lb/> become familiar with vice;
                            who wished, perhaps, to<lb/> return to the path of virtue, but had not
                            energy enough<lb/> to retrace their steps.</p>
                        <p>In forming an opinion of the depravity of convicts,<lb/> nothing can be
                            more unjust than to confound these<lb/> different classes in the same
                            judgment. All were once<lb/> innocent; but, blinded by passion, allured
                            by present<lb/> temptation, they have mistaken their true interest,<lb/>
                            and been gradually led into the depths of vice and<lb/> criminality. In
                            designating punishments for various<lb/> offences, the legislator can
                            regard only the tendency<lb/> of actions to injure society, and
                            distribute those pun-<lb/>ishments according to the comparative degrees
                            of harm<lb/> such actions may produce. He cannot foresee those <lb/><pb
                                n="61" facs="SW_TE1834_058"/>circumstances in the moral condition of the agent<lb/> which
                            may justly lessen or aggravate his guilt; and,<lb/> by the wise
                            constitution and jealous policy of our<lb/> laws, judges are not vested
                            with any discretionary<lb/> power to apportion the punishment according
                            to a<lb/> greater or less criminality of intention in the
                            offen-<lb/>der. It is in a penitentiary house, that an oppor-<lb/>tunity
                            is afforded of distinguishing the shades of guilt<lb/> in different
                            offenders, and of correcting that error<lb/> and injustice, in some
                            degree inseparable from the<lb/> best system of laws, by which persons,
                            whose guilt<lb/> admits of different degrees, are subjected to the

                        <p>The most efficacious means of reformation are to<lb/> be found in that

                            industry and sobriety<lb/> are formed. The inspectors have not been

                            the convicts are sentenced. By the great attention<lb/> paid to <emph

                            they<lb/> have shown their opinion of its importance in aiding<lb/>
                            reformation. Its benign influence on the physical<lb/> character, though
                            well understood by many, is not<lb/> duly estimated by the bulk of
                            mankind. Though<lb/> its effect on bodily health be more obvious, its

                            no where more fully experienced than in this<lb/> prison. It is found to

                        <p>In the winter, those of the convicts who have<lb/> appeared to be most
                            meritorious, are allowed, with<lb/> the approbation of the keeper, to be
                            taught reading,<lb/> writing, and arithmetic. Teachers are selected
                            from<lb/> such of them as are competent, and twenty are per-<lb/>mitted
                            to meet together daily with one of the keep-<lb/>ers, and to receive
                            instruction for about two hours in<lb/> the evening. This is considered
                            as a privilege, and<lb/> conferred on those only, who, by a peaceable,
                            indus-<lb/>trious, and regular course of conduct, have shown a<lb/>
                            disposition towards reformation. It is a further requi-<lb/>site for an
                            admission into this school, that the person<lb/>should have performed
                            labour above his task to the<lb/> value of four shillings a week, which
                            is to pay for<lb/> the implements of writing, light, and fuel.</p>
                        <p> Care is taken, as far as possible, to separate the<lb/> less vicious
                            from the more hardened and daring offen-<lb/>ders. About twenty-two of
                            the most obdurate crimi-<lb/>nals are kept confined and at work in
                            separate <lb/><pb n="63" facs="SW_TE1834_060"/>apartments, and are not suffered to come out,
                            or to<lb/> have communication with other prisoners, but are<lb/>
                            constantly watched by keepers day and night. Expe-<lb/>rience will
                            evince, that among any given number of<lb/> convicts, one tenth part may
                            be fairly considered as<lb/> desperate and hardened villains, who appear
                            incor-<lb/>rigible; and, it is of importance that such should be<lb/>
                            carefully selected and separated from the rest, as it<lb/> is more
                            probable they may, by proper management,<lb/> be reformed.</p>
                        <p>As another means of reformation, attention is paid<lb/> to their
                            religious and moral instruction.</p>
                        <p>A large room in the prison, very neatly finished, is<lb/> set apart for
                            the purpose of divine worship. This<lb/> room, and the gallery round it,
                            will accommodate<lb/> about six hundred persons.</p>
                        <p>In this place the prisoners are assembled on the<lb/> first day of each
                            week, when one of their number<lb/> reads a sermon and prayers, and the
                            rest join in sing-<lb/>ing psalms.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that the public preachers of the gos-<lb/>pel in the city
                            will cheerfully devote a small portion<lb/> of their time to the service
                            of these unhappy beings,<lb/> who have so much need of their
                            instruction, and of<lb/> the counsel of the truly good and
                            benevolent.</p>
                        <p>As no distinction of sect exists in this great work<lb/> of charity and
                            benevolence, it is hoped that religious<lb/> characters of every
                            Christian denomination will feel<lb/> it their duty to visit them on the
                            day set apart for<lb/> divine worship; since it is obvious that a due

                            salutary effects on the minds and conduct of the pri-<lb/>soners, and
                            most powerfully promote the great plan<lb/> of reformation.* <lb/><note

                        <p>Connected with this scheme of punishment and<lb/> reformation, is another
                            object, which, though of infe-<lb/>rior importance in a moral view, is
                            yet deserving of <lb/><pb n="64" facs="SW_TE1834_061"/> attention. This is, indemnity to the
                            community for<lb/> the expense of the conviction and maintenance of
                            <lb/>the offender. It is highly probable, that with due<lb/> management
                            and economy, the profit of the labour of<lb/> the convicts may be
                            rendered equal to their support.<lb/> Such a result, however, has not
                            been anticipated by<lb/> the zealous friends of reform in penal law in
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>.<lb/> They have regarded it
                            as the indispensable duty of<lb/> legislators, to meliorate the laws,
                            and correct the<lb/> abuses of prisons, without counting the cost of
                            their<lb/> justice or humanity. In <placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsylvania</placeName>, we are assu-<lb/>red, that the experiment
                            has been attended with<lb/> success;—and when the improved system of
                            the<lb/> penitentiary house of this state has had time to operate<lb/>
                            fully, there can be no doubt of a result equally <lb/> favourable. It
                            ought to have fair scope, and not to<lb/> be thwarted in its infancy, by
                            distrust, or the selfish<lb/> views of individuals or particular classes
                            of men. A<lb/> wise legislature will extend its concern to the
                            whole<lb/> community, and, regardless of private interests,
                            stea-<lb/>dily pursue a plan the best calculated to promote the<lb/>
                            general good.</p>
                        <p>In the first establishment of the prison, the inspec<lb/>tors have had to
                            encounter all the difficulties of a<lb/> new experiment, with the
                            disadvantage of imperfect <lb/>knowledge in many branches of
                            manufacture. A<lb/> system was to be formed, by which above two
                            hun-<lb/>dred convicts, many of them hardened, desperate,<lb/> and
                            refractory, and many ignorant, or incapacitated<lb/> through infirmity
                            or disease, might be brought into a<lb/> regular course of productive
                            labour. To find suitable<lb/> employment for so many persons, was a
                            matter of<lb/> considerable difficulty. In the choice of
                            occupations,<lb/> regard must be had to those which require the
                            least<lb/> capital, are most productive of profit, and most
                            con-<lb/>sistent with the health of the convicts, and the general<lb/>
                            security of the prison. Among the different kinds<lb/> of manufactures,
                            that of shoes was first introduced,<lb/> and has been fouud the most
                            convenient and profita-<lb/><pb n="65" facs="SW_TE1834_062"/>ble. The capital required for
                            the purchase of the raw<lb/> materials is not large, and the
                            manufactured article<lb/> will always meet with a ready sale; since the
                            con-<lb/>sumption of so indispensable a part of dress is great,<lb/> and
                            continually increasing, beyond the power of the<lb/> tradesmen of the

                            not until very lately that sufficient experience<lb/> was gained, in the
                            purchase of stock and the use of<lb/> machinery, to enable the
                            inspectors to manage this<lb/> branch of business with advantage. These

                            expense and embarrass-<lb/>ment. It is doubtful, whether the manufacture
                            of<lb/> nails, and of several other articles, ought to be carried<lb/>
                            on to a great extent, as they require too large a capi-<lb/>tal in
                            advance. Experience will furnish, every year,<lb/> grounds for
                            improvement in the mode of conducting<lb/> the branches of industry, or
                            in the introduction of<lb/> more advantageous kinds of labour; and there
                            is<lb/> every reason to believe, that, with a competent capi-<lb/>tal,
                            the business may be rendered so productive as <lb/>to defray the
                            expenses of conviction and maintenance<lb/> of the prisoners.
                            Calculations, however, founded on<lb/> the statements of the past year,
                            will not furnish ade-<lb/>quate means of judging with certainty of the

                            the convicts.</p>
                        <p>That the number of convicts has increased since<lb/> the erection of the
                            State Prison, is evident. But to<lb/> infer from that fact, that the new
                            and milder scheme<lb/> of punishment has been less efficacious in
                            preventing<lb/> crimes than the old and sanguinary system, would be<lb/>
                            a most partial and erroneous conclusion. The <emph rend="italic"

                            <lb/><pb n="66" facs="SW_TE1834_063"/>causes of this increase of crimes are the rapid
                            growth<lb/> of our population and wealth; the consequent luxury<lb/> and
                            corruption of, manners, particularly in the capital<lb/> of the state;
                            and the great number of indigent and<lb/> vicious emigrants from
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName> and the <placeName
                                key="westi">West Indies</placeName>,<lb/> driven hither by the
                            disordered and distressful condi-<lb/>tion of their native countries, or
                            to escape the ven-<lb/>geance of the laws.</p>
                        <p>More than <emph rend="italic">three fourths</emph> of the whole number
                            of<lb/> crimes are committed in the city of <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>. Its<lb/> population has almost doubled in ten
                            years, and the<lb/> increase of its trade and wealth is unequalled in
                            the<lb/> history of commercial states. It is certain also, that
                            under<lb/> the present system of punishment, a much less<lb/> number of
                            offenders escape conviction. Individuals<lb/> do not, from a sense of
                            the terrible consequences to<lb/> the party, refuse to prosecute; nor
                            juries, from motives<lb/> of compassion, forbear to convict the guilty.
                            This<lb/> is a most salutary consequence of the melioration of<lb/> our
                            penal laws.</p>
                        <p>The corruption of morals engenders those crimes<lb/> which pollute
                            society, and undermine the security of<lb/> life and property. It is the
                            duty of government to<lb/> begin at the source, and to endeavour, by
                            every<lb/> rational and practicable expedient, to prevent crimes,<lb/>
                            rather than to apply the painful and uncertain remedy<lb/> of punishment
                            to evils grown formidable by negli-<lb/>gence. It is in vain, under the
                            best devised plan of<lb/> punishment, to expect that crimes should be
                            dimin-<lb/>ished or exterminated, if laws are not framed to check<lb/>
                            the progress of vice, and to arrest the first steps of<lb/> guilt.</p>
                        <p>It is well known, that the greater number of crimes<lb/> originate in the
                            irregular and vicious habits produced<lb/> by intoxication, and by the
                            idle, low, and dissipated<lb/> practices encouraged in taverns and
                            tippling-houses.<lb/> There are few criminals whose gradual
                            depravation<lb/> cannot be traced to this source. It is well
                            ascertained,<lb/> that in this city there are more than twelve hundred
                            <lb/><pb n="67" facs="SW_TE1834_064"/>taverns or shops, where spirituous liquors are
                            retailed<lb/> in drams or in the form of grog. In eight or ten
                            con-<lb/>siderable streets, one fourth part of the whole num-<lb/>ber of
                            houses are <emph rend="italic">taverns and groceries</emph>, or, in
                            other<lb/> words, <emph rend="italic">dram-shops</emph>. The number of
                            taverns is unlimit<lb/>ited by law. By the city charter, the power of
                            granting<lb/> licenses is vested in the mayor, who is the sole
                            judge<lb/> of the propriety of granting them, or of their number.<lb/>
                            Thirty shillings are paid for each license, four fifths<lb/> of which
                            sum goes into the city treasury, and the<lb/> residue to the mayor.
                            While a revenue is derived to<lb/> the corporation from these licenses,
                            it is not to be<lb/> expected that there will be much solicitude to
                            lessen<lb/> their number, or to examine minutely into the merits<lb/> of
                            the applicants for them. Some regulations ought<lb/> to be adopted for
                            the reformation of the police in this<lb/> respect. Grocers ought to be
                            strictly prohibited from<lb/> retailing liquors in drams. The number of
                            taverns<lb/> ought to be greatly diminished. Licenses should not<lb/> be
                            granted but to persons who are recommended by<lb/> five known and
                            respectable citizens, and under much<lb/> larger penalties than at
                            present, to enforce their obser-<lb/>vance of the laws.* <note
                                resp="editor" rend="asterisk">* In the town of <placeName key="boston"

                            to<lb/> indulge in drink is so powerful, and the gratification<lb/> so
                            easy, at every turn of the street, that the greater<lb/> number spend a

                            of this depraved appe-<lb/>tite, during the day, and return to their

                            to society, are too striking to need any elaborate<lb/> description, to
                            enforce the propriety of adopting every<lb/> suitable means of

                        <p>A further source of vice and criminality is to be<lb/> found in the <emph

                            the neighbouring coun-<lb/>ties. These draw together crowds of people,
                            who<lb/> engage in wagering, all kinds of games of chance,<lb/> and in
                            debauchery, which produce habits that lead<lb/> to the ruin of many, and
                            drive numbers to the com-<lb/>mission of crimes. Horse-races,
                            billiard-tables, and<lb/> all games of chance, ought to be strictly
                            prohibit-<lb/>ed. <emph rend="italic">Baiting</emph> of animals with

                            Perhaps<lb/> there is no city of equal extent, where fewer crimes<lb/>
                            escape detection and punishment, or where greater<lb/> order and
                            tranquillity prevail. Too much praise can-<lb/>not be bestowed on those
                            to whom the peace and<lb/> safety of our city is entrusted, for their
                            unwearied<lb/>attention and vigilance in the discharge of duties,
                            the<lb/> extent and importance of which are not generally<lb/>
                            understood, or fully estimated. But, notwithstanding<lb/> the improved
                            state of our police, and the care of our<lb/> magistrates, every year
                            furnishes new objects of atten-<lb/>tion, evils which demand additional
                            remedies, and<lb/> more powerful reasons for devising and applying<lb/>
                            them in the best and most effectual manner.</p>
                        <p>Another object more immediately connected with<lb/> the subject of this
                            work, is the present mode of pun-<lb/>ishment for petty crimes. The only
                            prison in this<lb/> city for the punishment of those convicted of
                            small<lb/> thefts and other petty offences, is the <emph rend="italic"
                                >Bridewell</emph>, part<lb/> of which is also appropriated to the
                            safe keeping of<lb/> prisoners before their trial or conviction. At
                            present,<lb/> vagrants, disorderly persons, and convicts for petty<lb/>
                            offences, are confined in this prison ; and are put into<lb/> rooms
                            together, without any discrimination, or regard<lb/> to difference of
                            character. No proper or adequate<lb/> means are used to prevent
                            profanity, intoxication,<lb/><pb n="69" facs="SW_TE1834_066"/>filth, or idleness. In this
                            condition, corrupting and<lb/> corrupted, their imprisonment, so far
                            from tending to<lb/> produce the amendment of the culprits, or to
                            secure<lb/> society against the effects of their future misconduct,<lb/>
                            serves, by the contagion of example and the exaspe-<lb/>ration of bad
                            passions, to render them an hundred<lb/> fold more vicious and
                            untractable. It is, in truth, a<lb/>
                            <emph rend="italic">nursery</emph> of criminals for the state prison. As
                            a remedy<lb/> for this defect in the penal system, it is suggested,<lb/>
                            that a building should be erected by the corporation,<lb/> large enough
                            to contain sixty cells, of the same dimen-<lb/>sions as those in the
                            state prison-that the <emph rend="italic">police<lb/> magistrates</emph>
                            should have power to try, in a summary<lb/> way, and to sentence to
                            solitary confinement in these<lb/> cells, vagrants, drunkards, riotous
                            and disorderly per-<lb/>sons, &amp;c. for a time not exceeding thirty
                            days;—that<lb/> the quarter sessions of the city should send
                            persons<lb/> convicted of assaults and batteries, petit larcenies,<lb/>
                            and such offences as are not aggravated or atrocious,<lb/> for a time
                            not exceeding sixty or ninety days. The<lb/> convicts should be kept in
                            these cells in perfect soli-<lb/>tude, and on spare diet, in the manner
                            practised in<lb/> the state prison. Such a punishment, for sixty
                            days,<lb/> would be more severe and terrible, and tend more to<lb/> the
                            prevention of crimes, than confinement, for one<lb/> or two years, to
                            hard labour in the state prison. It<lb/> would also tend more to the
                            reformation of the offen-<lb/>der himself. Detached from vicious
                            companions, from<lb/> temptation, and from all means of gratifying
                            his<lb/> depraved appetites, conscience would have time to<lb/> awaken a
                            sense of guilt and remorse for his past<lb/> folly and misconduct.</p>
                        <p>Should a plan of such obvious utility be adopted<lb/> and carried into
                            execution, it would not then be neces-<lb/>sary to send convicts to the
                            state prison for a shorter<lb/> period than three years. For every
                            person once con-<lb/>fined in the solitary cells, who should, after his
                            release,<lb/> commit a second offence, would deserve to be
                            sen-<lb/>tenced to hard labour for at least three years. Indeed,
                            <lb/><pb n="70" facs="SW_TE1834_067"/>it might, with propriety, be left to the discretion
                            of<lb/> the court, in certain cases of second offences, to inflict<lb/>
                            the same punishment as in cases of grand larceny;<lb/> since it can
                            hardly be supposed, that any material or<lb/> lasting effect can be
                            produced on a criminal, by the<lb/> labour and discipline of a
                            penitentiary house, in a<lb/> shorter time than four or five years. And
                            if he is<lb/> incorrigible by means of solitude, temperance, and<lb/>
                            cleanliness, he will not merit, if he is guilty of a<lb/> second
                            offence, a punishment less severe than impri-<lb/>sonment for that
                            length of time.</p>
                        <p>It is not requisite, here, to enter into the details<lb/> of this plan of
                            a county prison; which, if found, on<lb/> experiment, to succeed in the
                            city of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, may<lb/> be
                            extended to <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and one or two
                            other coun-<lb/>ties, where the increase of population, and the
                            fre-<lb/>quency of petty offences, may render it necessary.</p>
                        <p>Before concluding this <emph rend="italic">account</emph>, it may be
                            proper to<lb/> make a few remarks, the result of some observation
                            and<lb/> experience, on a subject which may have an essen-<lb/>tial
                            influence on the present scheme of punishments.</p>
                        <p>It has been observed by BECCARIA, whose opinions<lb/> have the force of
                            axioms in the science of penal law,<lb/> that <quote>as punishments
                                become more mild, clemency<lb/> and PARDON become less
                                necessary;</quote> — that <quote>clemency<lb/> belongs to the
                                legislator, and not to the executer of<lb/> the laws: a virtue which
                                ought to shine in the code,<lb/> not in private judgments. To show
                                mankind that<lb/> crimes may be pardoned, or that punishment is
                                not<lb/>the necessary consequence, is to nourish the flattering<lb/>
                                hope of impunity.</quote>—<quote>Let then the executer of the<lb/>
                                law be inexorable, but let the legislator be tender,<lb/> indulgent,
                                and humane.*</quote>

                        <p>These principles, though just in theory, necessarily<lb/> presuppose a
                            perfect system of penal law, by which<lb/> each punishment is with such
                            exact justice appor-<lb/>tioned to each crime, that no difference of
                            circum- <lb/><pb n="71" facs="SW_TE1834_068"/>stances can arise in any case, which ought to
                            vary<lb/> the punishment prescribed for the particular offence.<lb/> No
                            code so perfect has yet been framed, and until<lb/> such a one is
                            promulgated, it is necessary that the<lb/> power of pardoning should
                            reside somewhere, to pre-<lb/>vent that injustice in particular cases
                            which the legis-<lb/>lator did not foresee, or could not avoid. By
                            our<lb/> constitution, this power is confided to the governor,<lb/> the
                            chief executive magistrate.* <lb/><note rend="asterisk">* In cases of
                                treason and murder, the governor cannot pardon, but may<lb/>
                                reprieve the convict until the next meeting of the legislature, who
                                may<lb/> pardon if they think fit. </note></p>
                        <p>And under the present penal laws, except in those<lb/> cases where the
                            punishment of death still remains,<lb/> the power of pardoning may be
                            exercised without<lb/> violating the principle advanced by the
                            philosopher<lb/> of Milan. It may be asserted, that, in the
                            deliberate<lb/> and impartial manner in which justice is
                            adminis-<lb/>tered in our courts, it is scarcely possible that any<lb/>
                            man can be <emph rend="italic">presented</emph>, by a grand jury, tried
                            and<lb/> convicted by a petit jury of twelve men, in the<lb/> presence
                            of the court and the world, without a degree<lb/> of guilt deserving of
                            some punishment. Imprison-<lb/>ment for a short period, under the mild
                            and humane<lb/> regulations of the state prison, cannot, in cases
                            the<lb/> most favourable to the prisoners, be deemed unjust.<lb/> It may
                            be laid down, then, as a general principle,<lb/> that no person,
                            convicted of a crime, and sentenced<lb/> to imprisonment, ought to be
                            pardoned, until he has<lb/> suffered a punishment proportioned to the
                            degree of<lb/> his guilt, or at least so much as may satisfy the
                            com-<lb/>munity he has injured. Under the guidance of this<lb/>
                            principle, it is believed, that the power of pardoning<lb/> may be made
                            conducive to a more perfect dispensa-<lb/>tion of justice, and
                            subservient to the plan of refor-<lb/>mation intended by a penitentiary
                            prison. It will<lb/> not be thought useless to endeavour to fix some
                            general<lb/> rules for the exercise of a power, which, if arbitrary<lb/>
                            and capricious, may produce consequences neither<lb/><pb n="72" facs="SW_TE1834_069"/>foreseen nor intended; but, if exerted with sound<lb/> discretion, so
                            far from weakening the laws, will<lb/> strengthen their operation.</p>

                                essential importance.<lb/> Indeed, this precaution has been taken by
                                the late<lb/> and present governor of the state, who have
                                applied<lb/> for the requisite information to the inspectors,

                                Previous to such recommendation, how-<lb/>ever, the inspectors think
                                it their duty to inquire,— <lb/>whether the prisoner was convicted

                                satisfy society, and to afford<lb/> a reasonable ground to believe
                                that his release will<lb/> not diminish the dread of future

                                attempted to violate any of its regulations;—and,<lb/> lastly,
                                whether, from what is known of his temper,<lb/> character, and
                                deportment, it is probable, that if resto-<lb/>red to society, he
                                will become a peaceable, honest, and<lb/> industrious citizen. These
                                inquiries ought to be<lb/> satisfactorily answered in favour of the
                                convict,<lb/> before he is recommended for pardon; for it is not
                                a<lb/> common or ordinary course of good conduct and indus-<lb/>try,
                                but a pre-eminent and unexceptionable behaviour,<lb/> that should
                                entitle a prisoner to this grace. A convict<lb/> radically and
                                incurably depraved, in hope of gaining<lb/> favour, may, for a
                                season, so far disguise his genuine<lb/> character, as to deceive

                            structures of folly and pride, with their founders, are<lb/> alike
                            exterminated and forgotten.</p>
                    </body>
                </floatingText>
                <p>This extract concentrates much that has been said<lb/> by seer or sage on this
                    subject since that date. He<lb/> goes on to demonstrate what can be done by
                    care<lb/> and sagacity in the great work of reform and econo-<lb/>my, and shows
                    that the labours of the convicts almost<lb/> supported themselves, and that the
                    State was only<lb/> charged five thousand dollars, and the salaries of the<lb/>
                    officers and keepers of the prison.</p>
                <p> Dissensions soon arose, not among the superin-<lb/>tendents of the prison, but
                    amongst the rulers of the<lb/> state. The council of appointment changed
                    the<lb/> whole board, and brought into office those who were<lb/> wholly
                    ignorant of the least of their duties. The<lb/> funds they were entrusted with
                    were badly spent,<lb/> and all the land-marks of economy and system swept<lb/>
                    away. There were two years of returning reason,<lb/> in <persName key="teddy1"
                        >Mr. Eddy</persName>'s opinion, when <persName key="wtorr1">Mr. William
                        Torry</persName><lb/> acted as agent. This good man attempted to bring<lb/>
                    back the laws and customs of the establishment to <lb/><pb n="76" facs="SW_TE1834_073"/>their
                    pristine course, but he, after two years service,<lb/> ceased to act in the
                    cause.</p>
                <p>Soon after the state prison was built in the city of<lb/>
                    <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName> began to think that if he had<lb/> not committed an error in
                    his plan, it certainly was<lb/> susceptible of improvement. He found, from
                    careful<lb/> observation, that several confined in a cell corrupted<lb/> each
                    other, for each one told to his companions his<lb/> career of vice, and all
                    joined by sympathetic villany<lb/> to keep each other in countenance. This, to
                    the eye<lb/> of the shrewd philanthropist was not long conceal-<lb/>ed ; and
                    like a man of moral intrepidity, he avowed<lb/> his error and condemned it.
                    There can be no doubt<lb/> but this single-cell plan now in use, was
                    conceived<lb/> and made known to the public by <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName>, before<lb/> it was thought of either in this country, or in
                        <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>,<lb/> by any other person. In <date
                        when="1802-03">March, 1802</date>, he visited <placeName key="alban"
                        >Al-<lb/>bany</placeName>, solely for the purpose of prevailing upon
                    the<lb/> Legislature to pass a bill for erecting a prison in the<lb/> city and
                    county of <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, and by degrees to
                    ex-<lb/>tend the plan to other districts in the state, which<lb/>prison was to
                    contain solitary cells. These prisons <lb/>were to be used for all those who had
                    committed<lb/> minor crimes, and no one was to be sent to the state<lb/> prison
                    for a less term than three years. Into the<lb/> solitary cells in these, the
                    prisoner was to be confined<lb/> according to his crime. So situated, he would
                    have<lb/> time to reflect upon his past conduct, and to begin<lb/> the work of
                    reformation. A bill was passed for this<lb/> purpose, but by making it optional
                    with the city<lb/> and county, instead of being imperative, the plan<lb/> was
                    not carried into effect, notwithstanding every<lb/> exertion of <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> and his friends, in urging it<lb/> upon the
                    corporation. One committee after another<lb/> took it into consideration, and
                    seemed highly pleased<lb/> with the plan, being convinced that it would be
                    a<lb/> means of preventing crime, yet they did not comply<lb/> with the
                    requisition. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was not to be
                    dis-<lb/>couraged by the failure. He mentioned his plan in <lb/><pb n="77" facs="SW_TE1834_074"/>a
                    letter to his friend <persName key="pcolq1">Patrick Colquhoun</persName>, Esq.
                    of <placeName key="lond">Lon-<lb/>don</placeName>, one of the great moral
                    reformers of the day, who<lb/> highly approved of it, and handed <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s com-<lb/>munication to <persName
                        key="haddi1">Lord Sidmouth</persName>, then Minister for the<lb/> Home
                    Department, who, as well as <persName key="pcolq1">Mr.
                    Colquhoun</persName>,<lb/> gave his decided approbation to the plan, and
                    wished<lb/> it should be introduced into <placeName key="engl"
                        >England</placeName>; and this was <lb/>done by the <placeName key="lond"
                        >London</placeName> Society for improving Prison<lb/> Discipline, and one or
                    two prisons were soon after<lb/> built upon this plan, one near <placeName
                        key="lond">London</placeName>, containing six<lb/> or seven hundred cells. A
                    prison was also built at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName>, in <placeName key="penns"
                        >Pennsylvania</placeName>, upon this construction,<lb/> containing from five
                    to six hundred cells. When the<lb/><placeName key="aubur">Auburn</placeName>
                    state prison was erected, <placeName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</placeName>
                    urged<lb/> them to have the buildings wholly divided into cells,<lb/> seven by
                    nine feet each, but most of the commission-<lb/>ers were afraid to try the
                    experiment fully, but did<lb/> it only in part, and this change from the old
                    plan<lb/> was made from their confidence in the judgment of<lb/> the
                    adviser.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1824">1824</date>, Messrs. <persName key="gtibb1"
                        >Tibbits</persName>, <persName key="salle1">Allen</persName>, and <persName
                        key="shopk1">Hopkins</persName>, were<lb/> appointed by the legislature of
                        <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>, to exa-<lb/>mine and report on
                    certain questions relating to the<lb/> state prisons; the result of their
                    labours was a confir-<lb/>mation of the system that <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName> had recommend-<lb/>ed twenty-two years before. These
                    commissioners,<lb/> on entering on their inquiries, issued a circular,
                    which<lb/> was answered by several gentlemen, and amongst<lb/> them, by
                        <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>. Notwithstanding the fact,
                    that<lb/> loose habits of doing business, and inattention to<lb/> the proper
                    methods of reformation, united to the<lb/> expense of the experiment, the public
                    had, in a good<lb/> degree, become tired of the penitentiary system, and<lb/> it
                    was thought by many, that it would be abandoned<lb/> altogether; yet <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> adhered to his previous<lb/> opinion, and
                    returned the following answer.</p>

                            questions relating to the State Prisons.<lb/>
                            <salute>RESPECTED FRIENDS,—</salute></opener>
                        <p>I received your circular letter, containing a number<lb/> of queries, to
                            which you request distinct replies.</p>
                        <p>First—<q>Is the present system established in the<lb/>
                                <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName> prison, a real system of
                                punishment? Are <lb/>the convicts, in general, less comfortable than
                                they<lb/> would be if at liberty?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—I beg leave to state that, in my opinion,<lb/> the system
                            established in the <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName> State
                            Prison<lb/> is not a real system of punishment calculated to
                            pre-<lb/>vent crimes.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly convicts are, in general, less comforta-<lb/>ble than they
                            would be if at liberty.</p>
                        <p>Second—<q>Have you ever known any satisfactory<lb/> instances of
                                reformation produced by the present, or<lb/> any prison discipline?
                                And, if so, please to state the<lb/> cases particularly, so far as
                                may be proper?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—The general habits of intemperance pre-<lb/>vious to the
                            confinement of convicts, and their ex-<lb/>treme attachment to the use
                            of ardent spirits, has<lb/> scarcely, in any instance, been cured even
                            by a long<lb/> imprisonment; and their minds, owing to a number<lb/> of
                            them being together during the night in one room,<lb/> have been so
                            corrupted, that experience has proved,<lb/> that reformation has rarely
                            taken place. During<lb/> several years that I served as an inspector of
                            our<lb/> state prison, I only recollect two cases of complete<lb/>
                            reformation. One of these has resided many years<lb/> in a neighbouring
                            government, the other, in this<lb/> state; both are, at this time, men
                            of considerable pro-<lb/>perty, much respected and well esteemed. It is
                            not<lb/> known to their present friends and neighbours, that<lb/> they
                            ever were under confinement. Each of them <lb/><pb n="79" facs="SW_TE1834_076"/>were four
                            years in our state prison, and, on account<lb/> of orderly conduct and
                            good behaviour, pardoned.</p>
                        <p>Third—<q>Has there been sufficient experience of<lb/> solitary
                                confinement, to enable you to answer the<lb/> same question in
                                relation to that mode of punish-<lb/>ment? And so far as your
                                experience or observation<lb/> may extend, please to state the
                                result?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—There has been no experience in the state<lb/> prison of
                                <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>, that would serve to
                            ascertain<lb/> how far <emph rend="italic">continual</emph> solitary
                            confinement may eventu-<lb/>ally produce reformation; recourse has only
                            been had<lb/> to it, as a temporary punishment for bad conduct in<lb/>
                            the prison—in this way it has produced good effects,<lb/> and has
                            generally been the means of enforcing clean-<lb/>liness, preserving
                            order, and good behaviour, even<lb/> among the most hardened
                            convicts.</p>
                        <p>When I was a member of the Board of Inspectors,<lb/> by-laws were
                            enacted, which declared, that all con-<lb/>versation, (except such as
                            might be necessary whilst<lb/> at work,) want of cleanliness, whistling,
                            attempting<lb/> to sing, &amp;c., were offences against the laws of
                            the<lb/> prison, and should meet with <emph rend="italic"
                                >immediate</emph> punishment,<lb/> by confinement in a solitary cell
                            on bread and water,<lb/> from one to three days, or longer, according to
                            the<lb/> nature of the offence. By a faithful and rigid execu-<lb/>tion
                            of these laws, the quiet and order of this prison<lb/> was, with some
                            exceptions, perfectly preserved; and,<lb/> as regarded neatness and
                            extreme cleanliness, no<lb/> prison in the world could surpass it.</p>
                        <p>Fourth—<q>If you shall be of opinion that the pre-<lb/>sent, or any
                                system of prison discipline, may be made<lb/> to produce material
                                and permanent reformation in<lb/> any large proportion of cases,
                                then be pleased to state<lb/> how, and in what way, in your opinion,
                                it becomes<lb/> operative towards that end? What are the
                                circum-<lb/>stances in the system which will tend to change the<lb/>
                                character of the convict, and how do they, or will<lb/> they,
                                operate? What can be done to make them<lb/> more effectual?</q>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="SW_TE1834_077"/>
                        <p>Answer—The subjoined general remarks, will serve<lb/> as a reply to this
                            query.</p>
                        <p>Fifth—<q>Can you suggest any means by which the<lb/> compulsory labour of
                                convicts, can be made to cover<lb/> the expense of supporting and
                                guarding them? or<lb/> any, by which the labour of the convicts of
                                this prison,<lb/> can be made more productive than at
                            present?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—I beg to make the same reference, as a<lb/> reply to this
                            query.</p>
                        <p>Sixth—<q>Can you suggest any means by which the<lb/> expense may be
                                diminished, and how? Can the guard<lb/> be dispensed with? Can the
                                rations be lessened with<lb/> propriety, or made cheaper?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—If the prison was rightly constructed, no<lb/> military guard
                            would be wanted; but, I apprehend<lb/> the expenses of the prison in
                            this city cannot be<lb/> diminished, unless the plan and construction of
                            it<lb/> should be completely altered. Not being acquainted<lb/> with the
                            quality and amount of the rations at present<lb/> served to the
                            convicts, it is impossible for me to say<lb/> how far they may, with
                            propriety, be lessened, or<lb/> made cheaper.</p>
                        <p>Seventh—<q>Please to state briefly your views of the<lb/> most effectual
                                system for the protection of society<lb/> against crimes; and
                                therein note such alterations, if<lb/> any, as you would suggest, in
                                the present system of<lb/> management?</q></p>
                        <p>Answer—My views as to the most effectual means<lb/> for protecting
                            society against crimes, will appear in<lb/> the subsequent remarks.</p>
                        <p>GENERAL REMARKS.</p>
                        <p>Many reasons might be offered, why the success of<lb/> the Penitentiary
                            System in this state has not been<lb/> equal to the expectations of its
                            early patrons, and of<lb/> the public at large.</p>
                        <p>1st. The inspectors have generally been changed<lb/> with every change of
                            our political rulers; hence, men<lb/> inadequate to the task, were
                            frequently appointed to <lb/><pb n="81" facs="SW_TE1834_078"/>fill the important office of
                            inspectors. These fre-<lb/>quent changes have produced a very great
                            increase<lb/> of expenses, and materially tended to prevent
                            suita-<lb/>ble and important improvements in the general
                            sys-<lb/>tem.</p>
                        <p>2d. The number of pardons that have been grant-<lb/>ed, has been attended
                            with most serious injury, and<lb/> very much prevented the good effects
                            that the system<lb/> might otherwise have produced. Pardon should
                            be<lb/> granted only on the discovery of facts unknown at<lb/> the
                            trial, which, if known, would probably have pro-<lb/>duced an acquittal.
                            In fact, it may be truly said,<lb/> that under a mild system, pardons
                            materially contri-<lb/>bute to the increase of crimes.</p>
                        <p>3d. In the <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName> prison, the rooms
                            lodge each<lb/> about twenty convicts, and owing to so many being<lb/>
                            brought together every night, they corrupt each other,<lb/> and thus
                            prevent complete order in the prison, and<lb/> all chance of reformation
                            is effectually defeated; the<lb/> elder criminals serve as teachers to
                            the younger, and<lb/> prepare them for the commission of greater
                            crimes<lb/> than those for which they have been convicted. Thus<lb/> the
                                <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName> prison, in place of
                            answering the pur-<lb/>pose for which the convicts are confined, viz.
                            their<lb/> reformation, becomes a nursery and seminary of vice.</p>
                        <p>4th. The authority given to the inspectors to in-<lb/>flict corporal
                            punishment for violating the laws of<lb/> the prison, respecting good
                            order, &amp;c. has no doubt<lb/> had a very injurious effect, for, it is
                            directly opposite<lb/> to the mild system that ought to prevail in a
                            peni-<lb/>tentiary. It must tend to harden the minds of the<lb/>
                            convicts, and materially lessen the chances of reform-<lb/>ation. To
                            adopt such a mode of punishment, is<lb/>extremely unwise, because the
                            more mild plan of<lb/> occasional confinement in solitary cells on bread
                            and<lb/> water, has been proved by experience, effectually to<lb/>
                            answer the most important purposes of strict and<lb/> rigid discipline.
                            The reasons above assigned are, in<lb/> my opinion, sufficient to show
                            why the Penitentiary <lb/><pb n="82" facs="SW_TE1834_079"/>System has failed to answer,
                            fully, the end and pur-<lb/>poses for which it was intended,
                            particularly as it<lb/> regards reformation.</p>
                        <p>I now shall respectfully offer for the consideration<lb/> of the
                            commissioners, my views of the most effectual<lb/> system for the
                            protection of society against crimes,<lb/> and the most certain means to
                            promote the reforma-<lb/>tion of convicts.</p>
                        <p>First. The great preventive of offences is doubtless<lb/> an early
                            attention to moral and religious instruction,<lb/> and thus to fortify
                            the infant mind with good princi-<lb/>ples. The observation made by John
                            Locke, is re-<lb/>markably appropriate and excellent:—<quote>I think, I
                                may<lb/> say, that, of all the men we meet with, nine parts of<lb/>
                                ten, are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by<lb/> their
                                education.</quote> That a careful attention to educate<lb/> the
                            children of parents in low circumstances through-<lb/>out the State,
                            would go far towards the prevention<lb/> of crimes, is demonstrated by
                            the fact, that in cons-<lb/>quence of a diligent search being made by a
                            com-<lb/>mittee of the <orgName key="nyfss">New-York Free School Society</orgName>, it was<lb/>
                            ascertained that but one boy of those who had re-<lb/>ceived their
                            education in the schools of that institu-<lb/>tion, had been convicted
                            of a petty crime, although<lb/> several hundreds who had not been at the
                            Free<lb/> Schools, had been tried at the Quarter Sessions, and<lb/> been
                            committed to the City Penitentiary, for vagran-<lb/>cy and various other
                            offences. We are told by high<lb/> authority—<quote type="biblical"
                                >Train up a child in the way he should<lb/> go, and when he is old,
                                he will not depart from it.</quote></p>
                        <p>The great error of all governments has been, not<lb/> affording
                            instruction to the lower class of society,<lb/> and inflicting
                            punishments often very disproportion-<lb/>ate to offences. It is
                            evident, that civilization has not<lb/> effected all the moral changes
                            and improvements that<lb/> can be produced in the constitution of human
                            society,<lb/> nor have laws and government been carried to the<lb/>
                            utmost limits of perfection. It is, therefore, highly<lb/> incumbent for
                            us to cherish the firm and unshaken<lb/><pb n="83" facs="SW_TE1834_080"/>conviction, that it
                            is not beyond the bounds of hu-<lb/>man effort to devise a system, that
                            will combine in<lb/> its tendency, the <emph rend="italic"
                                >prevention</emph> of crimes, and the reform-<lb/>ation of convicts.
                            Let us then ask any sagacious<lb/> observer of human nature, what should
                            be the inci-<lb/>pient step in order to protect society against
                            crime.<lb/> The answer is plain. To afford them a common<lb/> school
                            education, and fasten on their minds a know-<lb/>ledge of their duties
                            towards God, and carefully in-<lb/>struct them by means of the Holy
                            Scriptures, in the<lb/> principles of the Christian religion. Let, then,
                            the<lb/> present laws for common schools be cherished and<lb/> improved,
                            in such manner as will oblige parents of<lb/> the poorer classes in
                            society, to send their children to<lb/> some one of the common schools,
                            to be instructed in<lb/> reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in a
                            knowledge<lb/> of the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>By a legislative act, rules should be prescribed for<lb/> enforcing a
                            strict regard to the perfect cleanliness of<lb/> the persons of the
                            children, to their moral conduct, to<lb/> oblige the teacher to read at
                            the opening of the school,<lb/> daily, a chapter from a work entitled
                            Scripture Les-<lb/>sons, which is, on many accounts, preferable to
                            the<lb/> Bible for the use of schools, as it contains the most<lb/>
                            important part of the Scriptures appertaining to vir-<lb/>tue and good
                            morals. This book has been translated<lb/> into most of the languages of
                            Europe, and is exten-<lb/>sively used in the common schools in that
                            quarter of<lb/> the globe, and also in the United States. To make<lb/>
                            it the duty of all overseers of common schools, to em-<lb/>ploy such
                            teachers only, as are men of suitable quali-<lb/>fications, sober and
                            exemplary characters. Every<lb/> inducement should be used to encourage
                            parents (in<lb/> every place where it is practicable) to send their<lb/>
                            children to school, as soon as they reach three years<lb/> of age. This
                            might be done, by making it the duty<lb/> of overseers of each school,
                            occasionally to visit the<lb/> parents of the children, as has been done
                            by the trus-<lb/>tees of the <orgName key="nyfss">New-York Free School Society</orgName>.
                            Although<lb/><pb n="84" facs="SW_TE1834_081"/>the latter have, at present, under their
                            care, above<lb/> 4000 children, who receive a gratuitous education
                            at<lb/> the schools under their charge ; yet, notwithstanding<lb/> their
                            care and diligence in endeavouring to prevail<lb/> on parents to send
                            their children to school, it is be-<lb/>lieved that there are 8000
                            children in the city, who<lb/> are brought up without the advantage of
                            school<lb/> learning. An inspector might be appointed, in the<lb/>
                            manner other officers of the state are appointed, who<lb/> should be of
                            a respectable character and talents, and<lb/> be allowed a good salary;
                            his duty should be to visit,<lb/> once in each year, every common school
                            throughout<lb/> the state, and inquire into the condition of each
                            school,<lb/> the number of scholars; whether the laws of the state<lb/>
                            are duly complied with; the salary, name, general<lb/> character, and
                            qualifications of the teachers, and an<lb/> account of all the receipts
                            and expenditures; he should<lb/> make his report annually, to the
                            superintendent of<lb/> common schools, who should be directed to
                            present<lb/> the same to the legislature.</p>
                        <p>Next to providing for the moral and religious edu-<lb/>cation of
                            children, by means of common schools<lb/> throughout the state, it would
                            be productive of in-<lb/>calculable advantage, to erect a suitable
                            prison, solely<lb/> for the confinement of boys under sixteen years
                            of<lb/> age, considered as vagrants, or guilty of petty thefts,<lb/> or
                            other minor offences: it is believed that there are<lb/> but few amongst
                            the most guilty of this description<lb/> of juvenile delinquents, who
                            may not, by proper dis-<lb/>cipline, be subdued and reclaimed, by the
                            establish-<lb/>ment of a well-regulated prison for criminal youth.<lb/>
                            In Massachusetts, there is a prison for young convicts<lb/> in each
                            county. A number of the citizens of <placeName key="nycit"
                                >New-<lb/>York</placeName>, conceiving the great benefit that would
                            be de-<lb/>rived, by erecting a suitable building for the reception<lb/>
                            of such objects as has been described, have associated<lb/> for the
                            purpose, and have been incorporated by the<lb/> name of <q>The Society
                                for the Reformation of Juvenile<lb/> Offenders in the city of
                                    <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>.</q> This establish-
                            <lb/><pb n="85" facs="SW_TE1834_082"/>ment is in so great a state of forwardness as to
                            be<lb/> nearly ready for the reception of suitable objects. It<lb/> is
                            to be denominated the House of Refuge, and youth,<lb/> not exceeding
                            sixteen or seventeen years of age, are<lb/> to be committed there by the
                            criminal courts, instead<lb/> of being sent to the City Penitentiary, or
                            State Prison,<lb/> as has heretofore been the practice. At night
                            they<lb/> are to lodge in separate cells, and during the day, to<lb/> be
                            employed in some useful labour; they are to be<lb/> instructed in
                            reading, writing, and arithmetic. The<lb/> utmost degree of cleanliness
                            is to be strictly observed,<lb/>throughout every part of the building;
                            and in the<lb/> persons of the boys, good morals and decent
                            beha-<lb/>viour, are to be rigidly maintained; the careful and<lb/>
                            frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures is to be en-<lb/>forced. The
                            trustees are empowered to bind them<lb/> as apprentices, to the
                            sea-service, to a trade, or to<lb/> farmers. A similar establishment
                            might be formed<lb/> at <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, to
                            serve for <placeName key="troy">Troy</placeName> and other towns on the<lb/>
                            <geogName key="nrive">North River</geogName>, and the state might be
                            divided into con-<lb/>venient districts, and one establishment of
                            this<lb/> nature erected in each district.</p>
                        <p>A distinct and separate building should be erected on<lb/> the premises
                            attached to the state prison, for the confine-<lb/>ment of adults, males
                            and females, such as common<lb/> drunkards, prostitutes, those who keep
                            houses of ill<lb/> fame, or gambling-houses, or for those guilty of
                            small<lb/> petty thefts, or vagrants. This prison should be
                            divi-<lb/>ded into cells about the size of six feet by four.</p>
                        <p>A single magistrate should be vested with power to<lb/>commit persons to
                            this prison from three to thirty days.<lb/> Each prisoner should be
                            obliged to wash his face and<lb/> hands every morning. Rigid care should
                            be taken<lb/> to have each cell well ventilated, and kept perfectly<lb/>
                            clean; and this care should be extended, as far as pos-<lb/>sible, to
                            their clothes and personal appearance. He<lb/> should be confined in a
                            separate cell, and fed only on<lb/> bread and water, have no work, and
                            no bed, except<lb/> a single blanket. The prisoners should be allowed
                            <lb/><pb n="86" facs="SW_TE1834_083"/>no tobacco, and should be deprived of every kind
                            of<lb/> amusement; they should be permitted to have no<lb/> books,
                            except the Bible, and perhaps it might be most<lb/> beneficial that that
                            only be allowed them, when, in<lb/> the judgment of the keeper, their
                            minds appeared to<lb/> be in a disposition to read it with profit. No
                            person<lb/> should be permitted to converse with any prisoner,<lb/>
                            except the keeper, or those appointed to have the<lb/> superintendence
                            of the prison, or a magistrate. If the<lb/> prisoner be guilty of a
                            second offence, he should be<lb/> tried for it, and receive such
                            punishment as the court,<lb/> in their discretion, shall award him,
                            either to be re-<lb/>committed, or sentenced to the state prison.</p>
                        <p> The plan of confining the above description of<lb/> minor offenders in
                            solitude <emph rend="italic">without employment</emph> from<lb/> three
                            to thirty days, cannot fail, frequently, of having<lb/> the most
                            beneficial effect, as the prisoner will be then<lb/> forced to reflect
                            on his past life. It may also tend to<lb/> convince the convict that his
                            punishment is just; and,<lb/> unless this effect be produced on the mind
                            of the<lb/> prisoner, unless he be led to believe that his own<lb/>
                            welfare, as well as the public good, is consulted in<lb/> his
                            punishment, it will be in vain to expect reforma-<lb/>tion ; but, on the
                            contrary, to confine a man in a soli-<lb/>tary cell for months, or
                            years, is a punishment which<lb/> may appear to the criminal
                            unnecessarily harsh and<lb/> unjust, hardens his temper, and excites
                            those feelings<lb/> of enmity towards his species, that the thought
                            of<lb/> doing them an injury by the commission of new<lb/> crimes is
                            gratifying to him.</p>
                        <p>If it should be urged that solitary confinement will<lb/> be expensive,
                            it may be answered, that any expense<lb/> which it can possibly
                            occasion, should be considered<lb/> as nothing in comparison to the
                            accomplishment of<lb/> the great object which it concerns. And, besides,
                            in<lb/> proportion as crimes are lessened or decreased, or as<lb/> they
                            are summarily punished, the expenses of the<lb/> state, in relation to
                            the apprehension, detention, and<lb/> prosecution of criminals, are
                            diminished.</p>

                        <p>There is, as it appears to me, a moral and religious<lb/> view of this
                            subject, which should not be without its<lb/> influence. We are too apt
                            to forget while we are<lb/> providing for the protection of persons and
                            property<lb/> by passing laws for the punishment of crimes, that<lb/>
                            the human beings who may become obnoxious to<lb/> these laws, have also
                            their claims upon us. If it be<lb/> admitted that the infliction of
                            solitude, from three to<lb/> sixty days, for minor offences, will, while
                            it sup-<lb/>presses criminality in an equal degree with any other<lb/>
                            mode of punishment, also tend to reform the offender<lb/> more than any
                            other course would do, we are bound<lb/> by every feeling of humanity,
                            and by all the precepts<lb/> of the christian religion, to adopt that
                            course which<lb/> may raise a fellow-creature from degradation, fit
                            him<lb/> for usefulness in this life, and prepare him for that<lb/>
                            which is to come.</p>
                        <p><emph rend="italic">State Prisons, or Penitentiaries.</emph>—Great
                            inconveni-<lb/>ence, and apparent injustice, is frequently
                            produced,<lb/> in making the distinction of the punishment of those<lb/>
                            guilty of petty larceny, and those guilty of grand lar-<lb/>ceny:—a
                            person charged with committing the <emph rend="italic">former</emph>,
                            is<lb/> at present liable to be sentenced to the county prisons,<lb/> at
                            hard labour, for a term not exceeding three years;<lb/> and if guilty of
                            the <emph rend="italic">latter</emph>, for a term not less than<lb/>
                            three years, or not exceeding fourteen years. To<lb/> steal an article
                            of the value of twenty-five dollars, or<lb/> less, is deemed petty
                            larceny; and, if the value of the<lb/> article stolen exceeds
                            twenty-five dollars, it is termed<lb/> grand larceny. So that the
                            stealing of a watch,<lb/> valued at twenty-five dollars, is deemed petty
                            larceny,<lb/> but if a watch, valued at twenty-six dollars, grand<lb/>
                            larceny. Now, the moral turpitude being the same,<lb/> it is therefore
                            certainly absurd to make any differ-<lb/>ence in the punishment.</p>
                        <p>Although the moral turpitude of committing an<lb/> offence, in law deemed
                                <emph rend="italic">petty</emph> larceny, may frequently<lb/> be the
                            same as that denominated <emph rend="italic">grand</emph> larceny, I
                            do<lb/> not mean to contend that there should be no line of <lb/><pb
                                n="88" facs="SW_TE1834_085"/>distinction to mark the difference between them; but<lb/>
                            considering that, in order to graduate the punishment<lb/> as near as
                            possible to the nature of the offence, much<lb/> must necessarily be
                            left to the discretion of the court,<lb/> I would respectfully suggest
                            the propriety of an alter-<lb/>vation in our penal code, so as that
                            petty larceny,<lb/> should consist in stealing articles not exceeding
                            the<lb/> value of one hundred dollars. If this were done, the<lb/>
                            convict might be sentenced to a longer or shorter<lb/> confinement,
                                <emph rend="italic">according to his general character</emph>,
                            and<lb/> other circumstances, and <emph rend="italic">not according to
                                the value of<lb/> the goods stolen</emph>. An old offender stealing
                            goods to<lb/> the value of ten dollars, should certainly, in most<lb/>
                            cases, be punished with more severity than a <emph rend="italic"
                                >young</emph><lb/> offender stealing to the value of <emph
                                rend="italic">fifty</emph> dollars. Unless<lb/> there be a careful
                            and due discrimination of charac-<lb/>ter, in fixing duration of
                            punishment, courts may<lb/> frequently commit extreme and barefaced
                            injustice.<lb/> It is equally as sound a maxim in jurisprudence as<lb/>
                            in morals, <said who="undetermined">that he who punishes another for
                                offend-<lb/>ing against justice, should himself be just.</said></p>
                        <p>The state prison in this city is so badly contrived,<lb/> that it never
                            can be successfully used as a Penitenti-<lb/>ary ; it should be sold,
                            and a new one erected a few<lb/> miles from the city, constructed on the
                            same plan as<lb/> the state prison at <placeName key="aubur"
                                >Auburn</placeName>, to have separate cells, so<lb/> that the
                            prisoners might lodge separately. Every cell<lb/> should be properly
                            ventilated by means of a small<lb/> aperture next the ceiling, of three
                            inches diameter.</p>
                        <p> The prisoners ought to be kept constantly employ-<lb/>ed at such work as
                            the overseers of the prison should<lb/> think most suitable. To purchase
                            raw materials to<lb/> be worked up in the prison, has frequently been
                            at-<lb/>tended with loss, owing to want of skill in purchas-<lb/>ing,
                            and bad management in disposing of manufac-<lb/>tured articles to the
                            best advantage. The most<lb/> preferable plan would be, to make
                            contracts for<lb/> the labour of the convicts, with shoe makers,
                            stone-cut-<lb/>ters, &amp;c. &amp;c. the contractors furnishing the raw
                            ma-<lb/><pb n="89" facs="SW_TE1834_086"/>terials; but no contractor should be allowed to
                            enter<lb/> the prison, or to have any intercourse whatever with<lb/> the
                            convicts. The prisoners might safely be employ-<lb/>ed during the day in
                            the yards, and effectually pre-<lb/>vented from all improper intercourse
                            or conversation<lb/> with each other, provided the prison discipline,
                            before<lb/> recommended in the answer to the third query, be<lb/>
                            rigidly enforced. The cells should not be used, ex-<lb/>cept to confine
                            a convict on a low diet, when he vio-<lb/>lates any by-law of the
                            prison. The by-laws relating<lb/> to the government of the convicts,
                            such as preserving<lb/> the greatest degree of cleanliness in the
                            persons, and<lb/> in the rooms, halls, kitchen, and throughout
                            every<lb/> part of the prison, &amp;c. should be very minutely
                            de-<lb/>tailed, printed and fixed in different parts of the<lb/> prison,
                            and no offence against those rules should ever<lb/> escape being
                            punished, under any pretence whatever.</p>
                        <p>The confinement of criminals in a solitary cell du-<lb/>ring the whole
                            time of their sentence, say, from one<lb/> to five years, or more,
                            appears to be unnecessarily<lb/> severe. Suppose the term of his
                            punishment to be<lb/> three years, and that he should have some kind of
                            <lb/>daily employment, yet it appears to me, that the pro-<lb/>ject is
                            cruel and unjust, as it is highly probable<lb/> the health of the
                            convict would be impaired if not de-<lb/>stroyed, and in many cases it
                            would produce insanity.<lb/> We well know, that cruel and severe
                            punishment<lb/> has never proved sufficient to deter persons from
                            per-<lb/>petrating crimes; and to confine a man for years in<lb/> a
                            solitary cell, will be more likely to harden his<lb/> mind, and
                            brutalize his disposition, than to produce<lb/> his reformation. I am
                            very willing to admit, that<lb/> the observations I have made, may not
                            be correct in<lb/> every instance, as cases may occur, that will serve
                            to<lb/> prove, that a man may be confined in solitude for<lb/> several
                            years without injury to his health, and also<lb/> that reformation has
                            effected its perfect work; but I<lb/> am well assured that such
                            instances would very sel-<lb/>dom occur.</p>

                        <p>It is acknowledged by all, who have reflected on<lb/> the best means of
                            establishing a penitentiary system,<lb/><said who="undetermined">most
                                likely to protect society against crimes,</said> that<lb/> the
                            construction of the building should be such, as to<lb/> prevent the
                            convicts from improper intercourse with<lb/> each other; and that it is
                            impossible this important<lb/> end can be attained, unless each be at
                            night lodged<lb/> separately in a cell. It is in vain to expect any<lb/>
                            beneficial effects under the best regulations that can<lb/> be devised,
                            if the prison admit a number of prisoners<lb/> to lodge in one room.</p>

                            intercourse prevented;<lb/> this has been fully demonstrated by my own
                            expe-<lb/>rience as an inspector, during the first four years<lb/> after
                            the state prison in this city was erected. It is<lb/> only necessary to
                            punish any offender the moment he<lb/> commits an offence, by
                            confinement in a solitary cell<lb/> on bread and water. No person should
                            be allowed<lb/> to visit the prison, unless accompanied by a
                            magis-<lb/>trate or one of the inspectors. In the foregoing part<lb/> of
                            this communication, I have stated my sentiments, on<lb/> the
                            indispensable necessity of preserving the most per-<lb/>fect degree of
                            cleanliness, in the person of the prisoners,<lb/> and throughout the
                            prison, as it will produce the<lb/> best moral effects in the
                            preservation of order, and<lb/> aid materially in the reformation of the
                            convicts.</p>
                        <p>No undue severity should be exercised towards<lb/> prisoners. The best
                            general system of government<lb/> and management is by mild
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p> The plan of fixing tasks, or agreeing to make al-<lb/>lowance for extra
                            work performed by convicts, ought<lb/> not to be adopted; it is bad
                            policy, as it tends to<lb/> lessen too much the principle of punishment.
                            It<lb/> would be much better to give the convict, when dis-<lb/>charged
                            on the expiration of his sentence, a small<lb/> sum to serve him till he
                            can get into a situation to<lb/> earn something by his own industry, and
                            if he be<lb/><pb n="91" facs="SW_TE1834_088"/>inclined to endeavour to go to work, from three
                            to five<lb/> dollars will be sufficient to give him, and if he has
                            no<lb/> disposition to seek for employment, to give him even<lb/> a

                            more necessary, that convicts during their confine-<lb/>ment should

                            and absurd, cer-<lb/>tainly do not reflect, that to advise and admonish
                            the<lb/> most profligate and abandoned, is the usual practice<lb/> of

                            our holy religion. We ought not to<lb/> refrain from using such means as
                            may be in our<lb/> power, to produce an amendment and change in the<lb/>
                            dispositions of convicts, from an apprehension that<lb/> a <emph

                        <p>I do not approve of dividing the prisoners into dif-<lb/>ferent classes,

                            for the<lb/> different descriptions of convicts, this plan of
                            classi-<lb/>fication in any one prison will be useless, except<lb/>

                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> answered these inquiries, and others
                    in<lb/>different walks of life took up the pen. Among them<lb/> was <persName

                    Caldwell</persName>, of Transylvania<lb/> University, also wrote upon state

                    his favourite science, phrenology. <persName key="ccald2">Dr.

                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> lived to see his state prison

                        <p>The result of the wise la-<lb/>bours of these excellent men was the
                            perfecting of a<lb/> scheme of prison discipline, which had been
                            begun<lb/> partially at <placeName key="aubur">Auburn</placeName>, and
                            which is substantially the<lb/> model on which the reforms attempted in
                            most of the<lb/> other States have been conducted. It consists,
                            prin-<lb/>cipally, of the solitary confinement of the convicts<lb/>
                            during the night, and the time of taking their meals;<lb/> of labour
                            during the day; and of silence at all times,<lb/> except for the
                            purposes of communication with their<lb/> keepers; they are never
                            allowed to address each other,<lb/> not even by signs or looks. The
                            strictest supervision<lb/> is, of course, necessary, to secure
                            uninterrupted and<lb/> industrious labour, and to prevent the evil
                            communi-<lb/>cations which would otherwise abound. The advan-<lb/>tages
                            of this system are, that it affords an opportunity<lb/> alternately for
                            silent and solitary reflection, for the<lb/><pb n="94" facs="SW_TE1834_091"/>salutary
                            reflection of the mind upon itself; and for<lb/> that mental activity
                            upon other objects, and that re-<lb/>laxation from the severer task of
                            thinking, which is<lb/> at once necessary to preserve the healthy state
                            of the<lb/> mind and body, and to give efficacy to the meditation<lb/>
                            which is thus encouraged. But this alternation of<lb/> labour and
                            reflection is not the only, nor, perhaps, the<lb/> greatest advantage of
                            the plan. The unaided thoughts<lb/> of the corrupt and hardened might
                            recur to topics<lb/> which would be any thing but salutary; but, in
                            the<lb/> silence and darkness of night, the voice of religious<lb/>
                            instruction is heard; and, if any circumstances can<lb/> be imagined,
                            calculated to impress the warnings, the<lb/> encouragements, the
                            threats, or the hopes of religion<lb/> upon the mind, it must surely be
                            those of the convict<lb/> in his cell, where he is unseen and unheard,
                            and<lb/> where nothing can reach him but the voice which<lb/> must come
                            to him, as it were, from another world,<lb/> telling him of things
                            which, perhaps, never before<lb/> entered into his mind; telling him of
                            God, of eter-<lb/>nity, of future reward and future punishment, of
                            suf-<lb/>fering far greater than the mere physical endurances<lb/> of
                            the present life, and of joy infinitely beyond the<lb/> pleasures he may
                            have experienced. These instruc-<lb/>tions frequently discover to the
                            guilty tenant of the<lb/> cell, what seems often not to have occurred to
                            him,<lb/> the simple fact, that he has a spiritual nature; that he<lb/>
                            is not the mere animal which his habits and hitherto<lb/> uncontrolled
                            propensities would indicate; and this is<lb/> a discovery which alone
                            may, and does effect, a great<lb/> change in a man's whole character. He
                            feels that he<lb/> is a being superior to what he had thought
                            himself,<lb/> and that he is regarded as one having higher powers<lb/>
                            than he had supposed. The first step in the path of<lb/> improvement is
                            a prodigious one; a new ambition is<lb/> created, and the encouragement
                            of it is the principal<lb/> thing now needed. This encouragement it is
                            part of<lb/> the system to give. The spiritual guide of this
                            out-<lb/>cast flock must study the character and previous cir-<lb/><pb
                                n="95" facs="SW_TE1834_092"/>cumstances of every individual; he must adapt him-<lb/>self
                            and his instructions to their wants; he must<lb/> teach the ignorant,
                            arouse the careless, touch, if it be<lb/> possible, the impenitent, lead
                            the willing, and be <quote type="biblical">all<lb/> things to all men,
                                if by any means he may save<lb/> some.</quote> To the morning and
                            evening services of de-<lb/>votion, are to be added the more direct and
                            elaborate<lb/> instructions of the Sabbath, and the no less
                            important<lb/> influences which may be effected in private
                            inter-<lb/>course with the convict. The Sunday school may<lb/>
                            communicate the most valuable information on many<lb/> subjects; and
                            every improper influence may be, and<lb/> ought to be, absolutely
                            excluded. It is this system<lb/> of addressing the intellectual and
                            moral qualities of<lb/> man, of treating the convict as a being of a
                            compound<lb/> nature—both physical and spiritual—that constitutes<lb/>
                            the peculiar merit of the prison discipline, which is<lb/> now about to
                            be introduced. No new discovery has<lb/> been made, unless it be
                            considered one that criminals<lb/> may sometimes be made susceptible of
                            moral influ-<lb/>ences. It is only the adaptation of well known
                            prin-<lb/>ciples to a new class of subjects. It is merely carry-<lb/>ing
                            to the lowest, the most ignorant, and the most<lb/> degraded class, that
                            plan of education which is nearly<lb/> universal among us, and which
                            should be entirely so<lb/> every where. The exercise of mere force,
                            which has<lb/> been so long considered the only means of
                            punish-<lb/>ment, is at length yielding to the rapidly
                            strength-<lb/>ening conviction of the superior efficacy of moral<lb/>
                            influence.</p>

                    these<lb/> meetings by plans proposed by Mr. Eddy. There was<lb/> a field back
                    of the <placeName key="newyh">Hospital</placeName> of seven acres, which<lb/>
                    might have been purchased for one hundred pounds<lb/> an acre, and he urged the
                    Board to buy it without<lb/> delay, but in this he was, unfortunately for the
                    insti-<lb/>tution, overruled; yet nothing abated his ardour in the<lb/> cause of
                    this charity. The annual allowance from<lb/> the legislature to the hospital was
                    five thousand dol-<lb/>lars, and this was limited to four years. In <date

                    again visited <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and<lb/>procured the

                    procured an exten-<lb/>sion of the grant for five years. Notwithstanding<lb/>
                    this liberality, the governors could not extend their<lb/> plans according to
                    their wishes, and they did the<lb/> best they could until <date when="1806"
                        >1806</date>, when they again sent<lb/> their faithful representative with a
                    petition, the <lb/><pb n="97" facs="SW_TE1834_094"/>prayer of which was for an extension of these
                    grants<lb/> for fifty years, and it was allowed. The indefati-<lb/>gable
                    philanthropist did not become wearied in his<lb/> cause, for in <date
                        when="1810">1810</date> he again succeeded in getting an<lb/> additional sum

                <p>Early in the year <date when="1815">1815</date>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr.

                        <placeName key="newyh">Hospital</placeName>,<lb/> which enforced the
                    propriety of introducing an in-<lb/>stitution for lunatic patients, more
                    extensive than<lb/> had heretofore been in existence in this country.<lb/> The
                    communication is full of good sense without any<lb/> pretensions; and, although
                    all the sentiments it con-<lb/>tains are now familiar to us, they were novel
                    then<lb/> to most of those who had paid attention to the sub-<lb/>ject of
                    insanity. This communication is mentioned<lb/> in the history of the hospital,
                    and the proceedings<lb/> had thereon.</p>
                <p>An appeal was again made to the legislature for<lb/> assistance, and <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was requested to proceed<lb/> to <placeName
                        key="alban">Albany</placeName> and present a memorial, but this he
                    de-<lb/>clined for various reasons. It is a painful and labo-<lb/>rious task to
                    attend a winter session of a delibera-<lb/>tive body, and he thought he had done
                    more than<lb/> his share of this labour. No one can tell how irksome<lb/> it is
                    to talk with hundreds of persons, clothed with<lb/> authority, often captious,
                    sometimes suspecting self-<lb/>ishness, and generally impatient listeners,
                    when<lb/> caught in the lobbies or out of doors; and then it is<lb/> natural for
                    every man to feel an aversion to any one<lb/> who often comes on errands of
                    solicitation. To do<lb/> much and offend but few, was the peculiar gift of<lb/>
                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>. The Governors of the <placeName
                        key="newyh">Hospital</placeName> would<lb/> not vote to relieve him from
                    this duty, but particular-<lb/><pb n="98" facs="SW_TE1834_095"/>ly evaded the subject by leaving it
                    to <persName key="pjay1">Peter A. Jay</persName>,<lb/> Esq. then a member of the
                    legislature, a gentleman<lb/> of talents and weight of character. <persName
                        key="pjay1">Mr. Jay</persName> went to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, hut after a while wrote to <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> to come<lb/> to his assistance. The appeal
                    was made in such<lb/> strong terms, that he could not resist it, and he set<lb/>
                    out for <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and with the exertions of
                        <persName key="pjay1">Mr. Jay</persName>,<lb/> an act was passed, giving ten
                    thousand dollars a year<lb/> for the support of the insane, and for erecting
                    new<lb/> buildings. This act was limited by the act <said who="undetermined"
                        >for<lb/> the better support of the hospital,</said> which granted<lb/>
                    twelve thousand five hundred dollars for fifty years.<lb/> Probably many members
                    had forgotten when the act<lb/> would expire, and those who did remember
                    the<lb/> fact, did not choose to say any thing about it. View-<lb/>ed in any
                    light, it was a liberal donation for a noble<lb/> purpose. Nearly eighty acres
                    of land were pur-<lb/>chased at <placeName key="bloomd"
                    >Bloomingdale</placeName>, and a fine building erected<lb/> for the
                    accommodation of the insane. The success<lb/> of his exertions, and those of his
                    coadjutors, gave<lb/>
                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> the liveliest pleasure, which he took
                    no<lb/>pains to disguise. He always felt himself an in-<lb/>structor of those
                    whose minds were sickly, and he<lb/> believed that, though it was difficult, yet
                    it was not<lb/> impossible to<lb/>

                    derangement is one of deep<lb/> interest to the philanthropist. To mark insanity
                    in<lb/> all its various forms, to go back to the cause of its<lb/> existence,
                    whether moral, physical, or accidental,<lb/> requires acuteness and constant
                    observation. The<lb/> wise and the kind feel assured that they carry with<lb/>
                    them many cures and a thousand anodynes for mise-<lb/>ry. Those who devote a
                    life to doing good, in cu-<lb/>ring or soothing the maladies of the mind,
                    improve <lb/><pb n="99" facs="SW_TE1834_096"/>their own intellects, and at the same time are
                    learn-<lb/>ing lessons for the government of their own passions,<lb/> and
                    purifying their own affections. They find that<lb/> the furious maniac yields to
                    gentle firmness, when<lb/> he would rave at severity; that melancholy may
                    be<lb/> banished by the voice of cheerfulness and kindness,<lb/> when it would

                    be<lb/> quickened into life and mental action by proper<lb/> moral sentiments.
                    It is an acknowledged fact, that<lb/> those who have the care of the insane are
                    generally<lb/> cheerful; one cause of which may be, that they feel<lb/>
                    conscious of being in the way of doing good, and the<lb/> effects of their
                    exertions are constantly before them;<lb/> and, perhaps, another is, that the
                    same mind is unceas-<lb/>ingly dwelling upon the blessings it enjoys in its<lb/>
                    sanity, and draws comparisons between itself, and<lb/> those unfortunate beings
                    who are deprived of reason,<lb/> as we take a more elastic step when we pass a

                <p>The Indians within the United States have been<lb/> harassed, warred upon, driven
                    from their primitive<lb/> abodes, and, at times, hunted down as beasts of
                    the<lb/> forest. Sometimes they were sinned against, but <lb/>often sinning in
                    the causes which produced this dis-<lb/>tress. They thought this whole continent
                    their own,<lb/> and that they were sole proprietors of it. Their<lb/> ideas of
                    national rights and of political economy<lb/> were not very extensive, but their
                    patriotism and<lb/> courage will never be doubted by those acquainted<lb/> with
                    their history. At times, they seemed to wish to<lb/> be friends; at other times,
                    were vindictive and blood-<lb/>thirsty.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Indians were among the fiercest on<lb/> the continent. <persName
                        key="metac1">King Philip</persName> is a noble instance of<lb/> sagacity and
                    love of country ; and the <orgName key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName>, so<lb/>
                    well known in the history of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>, were
                    brave, <lb/><pb n="100" facs="SW_TE1834_097"/>and most generally faithful to their treaties. But
                    it<lb/> often happened, that when the philosopher was con-<lb/>templating them
                    as patriots and warriors, he heard<lb/> of some of their massacres and
                    conflagrations, and<lb/> his resentment arose against them at their
                    barbarous<lb/> disposition. Or, he saw them through the medium<lb/> of taste,
                    and was disgusted with their filthy habits<lb/> and wandering course of life.
                    When <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> began<lb/> his career of active
                    philanthropy, the <orgName key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName> had<lb/> been so
                    far reduced as not to be feared, but rather to<lb/> be pitied. Their case came
                    within the view of the<lb/> charities of his religious order, and he made
                    himself<lb/> acquainted with their situation, their habits, and cha-<lb/>racter.
                    In <date when="1793">1793</date>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>,

                    attended the meeting for making<lb/> a treaty, held by <persName key="pschu1"
                        >General Schuyler</persName>, and other com-<lb/>missioners, with the
                    Indians, seven hundred of whom<lb/> were present. <persName key="teddy1">Mr.

                    on<lb/> their return, made so favourable a report to the<lb/>

                    exer-<lb/>tions in the cause—considerable sums were appropri-<lb/>ated to
                    instruct and civilize them. He was not very<lb/> sanguine, in this charity, of
                    doing much good, notwith-<lb/>standing the great interest he took in the welfare
                    of<lb/> the Indians. He saw that their original character<lb/> was every day
                    changing, and that the whites, some-<lb/>times honestly, and by fair contract,
                    but often impro-<lb/>perly, were encroaching on their grounds: but there<lb/>
                    was another side to the question; a race of industrious<lb/> men, adorned with
                    all the arts and sciences of civi-<lb/><pb n="101" facs="SW_TE1834_098"/>lization, was growing up and
                    occupying a space for<lb/> a village, where thousands were supported, that
                    would<lb/> not have furnished <said who="undetermined">room and verge
                        enough</said> for a<lb/> dozen aboriginal hunters, according to their
                    notions<lb/>of life. But, if such men as <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName> had been in<lb/> the Council for Indian affairs, the tribes
                    would have<lb/> faded away, if that is their fate—and who can doubt<lb/>
                    it?—with less suffering and less repining than is now<lb/> witnessed. His
                    hospitable mansion was a wigwam<lb/> to the travelling Indian, where he drank
                    when thirsty<lb/> and ate when hungry. He sometimes had a dozen<lb/> Indians,
                    men, women, and children, in the house at<lb/> once. Among his Indian
                    acquaintance, was the fa-<lb/>mous <persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName>,
                    of the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca</orgName> tribe. This chief<lb/> was a
                    warrior and orator of high intellectual powers<lb/> and commanding mien. His
                    head was the admira-<lb/>tion of the phrenologist, and his rifle was as
                    un-<lb/>erring as death. This man exhibited all that was<lb/> noble in the
                    savage; he was brave, sagacious, and<lb/> patriotic, but he yielded to the
                    weakness of intem-<lb/>perance, and showed the worst as well as the best<lb/>
                    qualities of their fallen nature. His tribe once de-<lb/>posed him from power as
                    a chief, for his imprudence;<lb/> but he had energy of character enough to
                    redeem<lb/> himself, and regain his power in his tribe—a singu-<lb/>lar
                    occurrence in savage or civil life. To <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                        Eddy</persName>,<lb/><persName key="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> was a
                    study, and so was <persName key="teddy1">Eddy</persName> to <persName
                        key="redja1">Red<lb/>Jacket</persName>, for he, too, with all his
                    fierceness, was a phi-<lb/>lanthropist and a philosopher. Since <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s death,<lb/>the state of the Indians has
                    excited much feeling in the<lb/>community, but the time is rapidly approaching,
                    when<lb/> this subject will only be a bygone tale. In New Eng-<lb/>land, there
                    are a few remnants of several once power-<lb/>ful tribes, but they are mixed
                    with the Africans, and<lb/>have no importance in the community. Though
                    some<lb/>of their ancient territories are, in some instances, ap-<lb/>propriated
                    to their use, and the States act as guardians,<lb/> in order that these shall

                    not to forget that there<lb/> have been philanthropists who have struggled to

                    of civilization and Christianity. The <lb/>following letters will show how much
                    has been done.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Our ears have been open to hear from you these<lb/> many days, but have
                            not heard a word. And we<lb/> suppose you also have expected to hear our
                            welfare,<lb/> and have not heard one word.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—With pleasure we have retained the good<lb/>counsels you given
                            us when you were here our place.<lb/> We have been endeavoured to follow
                            the way you<lb/> pointed out for us. Now we will also inform you
                            <lb/>that our nation at large enjoy their health ever since<lb/> you
                            left us. This, we acknowledge, is merely from<lb/> the <emph
                                rend="italic">good Spirit</emph>. We are sorry to hear that many
                            of<lb/> our white brothers at <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName>, have been taken<lb/> away by death. This, also, we
                            believe, is by the<lb/> will of the same <emph rend="italic"
                                >Spirit</emph>.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—We believe that you have heard the<lb/> childish conduct of our
                            brethren, the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>, with<lb/> regard
                            to their land affairs, therefore, 'tis needless that<lb/> we should say
                            any thing about it.</p>
                        <p>As we look upon you to be our true Friends, we<lb/> write to you as such;
                            you are sincerely wished that<lb/> our poor Nations should be build up
                            so as to become<lb/> civilized people; we, also, have an earnest wish
                            for<lb/> the same. We ever have endeavoured to promote the
                            happi-<lb/>ness of our Nation here, but our depend ance is
                            wholly<lb/><pb n="103" facs="SW_TE1834_100"/>on him who is able to do more for us than we
                            can<lb/> ask. Still, we believe, that in some respects he will<lb/> not
                            do any thing without our endeavours.</p>
                        <p> Brothers—By your good counsels, you have given<lb/> us good
                            encouragement to go on in the good way,<lb/> and although we have been
                            endeavoured to do what<lb/> we have told you, but as we are new
                            beginners we<lb/> find ourselves to be as children who could not
                            walk<lb/> strait or go alone without little help by some Friend.</p>
                        <p>And we also find some real obstructions in the way<lb/> which we can
                            avoid if we can get some help. And<lb/> as you are our Friends, we will
                            open our minds<lb/> freely unto you. Here we have upwards than
                            sixty<lb/> families who are not acquainted how to make cloth<lb/> of no
                            kind; it has been therefore necessary for each<lb/> one to go out from
                            the Town, at times, to seek some<lb/> articles of clothing among the
                            white traders; and<lb/> the traders generally set up great price on
                            their<lb/> goods.</p>
                        <p>In this way of living, among so many families,<lb/> have spend many many
                            a days in one year. Besides<lb/> all this, there are some Indians who,
                            while they seek-<lb/>ing where to purchase some necessary articles
                            for<lb/> their poor families, they have been overtaken by the<lb/>
                            strong Heroe, and robbed by him, and come home<lb/> almost naked and
                            starved.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—This is one obstruction on our way; in<lb/> order to avoid it,
                            we would ask your assistance. If<lb/> you can find it in your minds so
                            as to do it with<lb/> ease to trust us few articles of clothing, that we
                            may<lb/> keep little store in our Town, that our people may<lb/> not
                            spend much of their time as they have done, and <lb/>that the white
                            traders may not take all the advan-<lb/>tages on this respect as they
                            always did. And the<lb/> great Heroe (whose name is <emph rend="italic"
                                >Rum</emph>) should not rob<lb/> our Indians as he has done these
                            many years. This<lb/> means will fasten our Nation at one place, we
                            the<lb/> subscribers, engage to pay you at such a time as we<lb/> may
                            agree. If such thing can take place here, it <lb/><pb n="104" facs="SW_TE1834_101"/>would
                            also great deal help our brethren, the <orgName key="oneida"
                                >Oneidas</orgName><lb/> and <orgName key="tuscarora"
                                >Tuscaroras</orgName>. This, Brothers, is our request—and<lb/> we
                            leave it to your consideration—and desire to hear<lb/> your voices as
                            soon as you can find it convenient to<lb/> send answer. This is all what
                            we have to say.</p>

                        <p>A few days ago we received your letter, dated<lb/>
                            <date when="1795-11-19">19th of last month</date>. The account you give
                            us of your<lb/> welfare affords us much satisfaction, and we
                            rejoice<lb/> to find that you retained the counsel and advice we<lb/>
                            gave to you at <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName>, and our
                            written commu-<lb/>nications at <placeName key="broth"
                                >Brothertown</placeName>. We hope you will dili-<lb/>gently attend
                            to the voice of the good Spirit, which<lb/> is placed in all men's
                            hearts, and which is all sufficient<lb/> to lead out of all bad
                            practices—and as you closely<lb/> pursue those ways which is consistent
                            with this<lb/> divine Spirit, you will witness, by experience, that
                            it<lb/> will be your strength, your good Counsellor, and your<lb/> true
                            Comforter. Since our return home we have been <lb/><pb n="105" facs="SW_TE1834_102"/>very
                            thoughtful about our Indian Brethren, and in-<lb/>tended soon to have
                            wrote to you.</p>
                        <p>Our minds, as well as your other Friends in this<lb/> city, have been
                            much employed in thinking in what<lb/> way we could best serve you; we
                            are sensible you<lb/> want assistance, and we are very desirous of
                            helping<lb/> you to become Farmers, and learn some useful trades,<lb/>
                            so that you may not find it necessary to go so much<lb/> out among the
                            white people, which has been already<lb/> of great hurt to your young
                            men, by exposing them<lb/> to be overtaken by the great Hero, as you
                            very justly<lb/> observe. But, Brothers, we must tell you in plain<lb/>
                            words, that unless you are in earnest, and particu-<lb/>larly the peace
                            makers and chiefs among yourselves,<lb/> to make by-laws to prevent your
                            Nation from going<lb/> so much among the white people, or bringing
                            Rum<lb/> into your Nation, we may be discouraged from lend-<lb/>ing you
                            assistance. Now, Brothers, we want you to<lb/> be wise, study your own
                            good, and endeavour to<lb/> promote your own happiness. We fully depend
                            on<lb/> you to use exertions to make a reform in your Nation,<lb/> and
                            that you will, in the first place, strive to leave<lb/> off drinking
                                <emph rend="italic">Rum</emph>, as being the first and great
                            step<lb/> to your becoming a sober and industrious, and, in<lb/> time, a
                            civilized people; and hoping this happy<lb/> change may take place, you
                            may likely again receive<lb/> another visit next summer from some of our
                            Society;<lb/> and in order to encourage you to go on in well-doing,<lb/>
                            we have agreed to comply with your request in<lb/> sending you a few
                            goods, in confidence that you will<lb/> pay us punctually for them in
                            twelve months.</p>
                        <p>As we have endeavoured to point out the path<lb/>which leads to your
                            happiness in this world and the<lb/> next, so we hope you will be
                            favoured with strength<lb/>and good resolutions to walk in it; and, as

                            furnish-<lb/>ing you with some goods, so we particularly request<lb/> of
                            you to be very cautious how you suffer them to<lb/> go out of your

                            the future favour and friendship<lb/> of our Society; which, that it may

                        <p>In all my intercourse and acquaintance, I have<lb/> endeavoured to give
                            you proofs that I am your friend.<lb/> Of this truth I trust you are
                            well convinced. If, <lb/>then, you believe me to be your friend, you
                            will listen<lb/> to my talk; and if you think I have understanding<lb/>
                            to discern what is for your best good, you will attend<lb/> to my
                            advice.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—I have often shown you what good things<lb/> the white people
                            enjoy, and explained how you might<lb/> also enjoy them. You have
                            answered, that what I<lb/> told you was very good, and that you were
                            willing <lb/><pb n="107" facs="SW_TE1834_104"/>to adopt the useful ways of the white people
                            by <lb/>degrees, but that you could not lay aside your old<lb/> customs
                            all at once. This was a wise answer. It<lb/> will be necessary for you
                            to continue your hunting<lb/> while the game is so plenty as to be worth
                            pursuing.<lb/> But you already know that the game is becoming<lb/>
                            scarce, and have reason to expect, that in a few years<lb/> more it will
                            be gone. What then will you do to feed<lb/> and clothe yourselves, your
                            wives and children?<lb/> Brothers, this is an important question; think
                            well<lb/> upon it; the oldest hunters may, perhaps, find some<lb/> game
                            as long as they live; but before the young men<lb/> grow old, all the
                            game will be destroyed; the young<lb/> men, then, and the boys, should
                            learn to get food and<lb/> clothing without hunting. How are they to do
                            this?<lb/> By cultivating the ground as the white people do;<lb/> for
                            with what grows out of the ground they can<lb/> purchase all other
                            necessaries. If you make fences<lb/> to enclose many fields, you can
                            then securely raise<lb/> corn, wheat, and hay in abundance, to feed
                            your<lb/> families, and as many cattle and hogs as you want,<lb/> and
                            the cattle and hogs will give you more meat than<lb/> you could ever
                            obtain by hunting, even when game<lb/> was plentiest.</p>
                        <p>Now, Brothers, I have the good pleasure to inform<lb/> you, that your
                            good friends, the Quakers, have formed<lb/> a wise plan to show your
                            young men and boys the<lb/>most useful practices of the white people.
                            They will<lb/> choose some prudent good men to instruct them.<lb/> These
                            good men will do this only for the love they<lb/> bear to you, their
                            fellow men, as children of the Great<lb/> Spirit, whom they desire to
                            please, and who will be <lb/>pleased with the good they do to you. The
                            Quakers<lb/> and the good men they employ, will ask nothing<lb/> from
                            you, neither land, nor money, nor skins, nor<lb/> furs, for all the good
                            they will render unto you; they<lb/> will only request your consent, and
                            the attention of<lb/> the young men and boys to learn what will be
                            so<lb/> useful.</p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="SW_TE1834_105"/>
                        <p>Brothers—If this first attempt succeeds, the way<lb/> will be opened in
                            which your young people may<lb/> learn other useful practices of the
                            white people, so<lb/>as to enable them to supply all their own wants,
                            and<lb/> such as choose it may learn to read and write.</p>
                        <p> Having thus explained to you the plan of your<lb/> friends, the Quakers,
                            I conclude with heartily recom-<lb/>mending it to your adoption, as
                            better calculated to<lb/> procure lasting and essential benefits to your
                            Nations<lb/> than any plan ever before attempted. Wishing it<lb/> great
                            success, I remain your friend and brother,</p>

                        <p>The Society of Friends, always manifesting a<lb/> desire to promote the
                            best interest of the Indians,<lb/> have now formed a plan to introduce
                            among them<lb/> the most necessary arts of civil life, and have
                            raised,<lb/> and will raise, money, and employ agents, to carry<lb/> it
                            into effect, or at least to make a fair experiment<lb/> to change their
                            present habits, and to adopt in their<lb/> places the practice of those
                            most necessary arts. In<lb/> this attempt, the Friends will need the
                            assistance of<lb/> all well disposed men, who are capable of
                            deriving<lb/> pleasure from the happiness of their fellow men, and<lb/>
                            are therefore willing to promote it. But, of all men,<lb/> those who
                            understand the language of the Indians,<lb/> if possessed of capacity
                            and humanity, have it in<lb/> their power to do them most good; for this
                            reason,<lb/> the Friends earnestly desire your aid; their great<lb/>
                            object is, not to teach peculiar <emph rend="italic">doctrines</emph>,
                            but useful<lb/>

                            <lb/><pb n="109" facs="SW_TE1834_106"/> connected with it. This is beginning at the
                            right<lb/> end, and, if so much can be accomplished, their far-<lb/>ther
                            improvements will follow of course.</p>
                        <p>The agents whom the Friends mean to engage to<lb/> reside among the
                            Indians, will be men divested of all<lb/> mercenary views, and devoted
                            for the time solely to<lb/> the pursuit of the object above
                            explained.</p>
                        <p>To the request of the Friends I add mine, that you<lb/> will embrace

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>The Society of Friends have formed a plan to<lb/> instruct the Indians of
                            the <orgName key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName> in husbandry<lb/> and
                            the most necessary arts of civil life. The good-<lb/>ness of the design,
                            and the disinterestedness of the<lb/> motives, must recommend it to the
                            favour and support<lb/> of all who wish the happiness of their fellow
                            men.<lb/> You are of this number, and as the Indians have<lb/>
                            confidence in you, it will be in your power greatly<lb/> to promote the
                            success of the plan; and I am sure<lb/> you will not need urging to
                            exert it, on all fit occa-<lb/>sions. The persons who will be employed
                            by the<lb/> Friends in this benevolent undertaking, will make<lb/>
                            themselves known to you, and ask your advice and<lb/> assistance. You
                            will oblige me by presenting my<lb/> kind regard to your brother and
                            sister, and I beg you<lb/> to be assured of my esteem and
                            friendship.</p>

                            they hoped their trade was well worth their<lb/>attention; that the

                            introducing the plough<lb/>among them, had been considered and approved
                            by<lb/>the women, who had the greatest interest in it, as<lb/>the labour
                            fell wholly on them; that they had also<lb/>approved of the request for
                            teachers to be sent among<lb/>them to instruct their young people; that

                            recom-<lb/>mend, from our knowledge of him, as your good<lb/>friend. We
                            are satisfied he has the welfare of your<lb/>Nation much at heart, and,
                            as we have given you<lb/>many proofs of our steady friendship, we hope
                            you<lb/>will now closely attend to such advice as <persName key="wfloy1"
                                >General<lb/>Floyd</persName> may give you. He will kindly inquire
                            into<lb/> your situation, and you must make known your<lb/> wants to
                            him; he will advise you what by-laws and<lb/>regulations may be
                            necessary for you to make among <lb/>yourselves, and you will inform him
                            of such as you<lb/> have already made, so that he may give you his
                            senti-<lb/>ments thereon. Having had several conversations<lb/>with him
                            on the subject of your affairs, we shall<lb/> leave him to inform you of
                            the supplies that is pro-<lb/>posed to be handed you this summer. You
                            need not<lb/>fresh assurances from us, how desirous we are
                            to<lb/>promote your welfare every way, as we believe a<lb/>reformation
                            is really began among you; we earnestly<lb/>recommend to those sober men
                            and women who have<lb/>so nobly stepped forward in so good an
                            undertaking,<lb/>that they persevere in a steady conduct, and, by
                            set-<lb/>ting examples of sobriety and industry, induce others<lb/>to
                            join them, not only in refraining themselves from<lb/>the least use of
                            spirituous liquors, but to put your<lb/>laws in full force against all
                            offenders in this respect.<lb/>Until this shameful practice is entirely
                            laid aside,<lb/><pb n="112" facs="SW_TE1834_109"/> you will labour under many great
                            disadvantages,<lb/>and will prevent us from serving you so fully as
                            we<lb/>wish to do.</p>
                        <p>We trust you will closely attend to <persName key="wfloy1">General
                                Floyd's</persName><lb/>counsel, which will be for your good, as we

                        <p>Before you cover your Council Fire, we beg your<lb/>attention to the
                            voice of your brethren. The different<lb/><pb n="113" facs="SW_TE1834_110"/>tribes living at
                                <placeName key="oneida">Oneida</placeName> country, speaks to you in
                            re-<lb/>membrance of the friendship you have manifested<lb/>towards them
                            in all our treaties; we ourselves have<lb/>held Councils at different
                            times, to contemplate the<lb/>welfare of our nations, because we cannot
                            but groan<lb/>to see our situation; it is also melancholic to
                            reflect<lb/>on the ways of our forefathers.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—You, also, sometimes sorry to see the de-<lb/>plorable situation
                            of your Indian Brethren, for which<lb/>you have given us many good
                            counsels; though we<lb/>feel willing to follow your counsels, but it has
                            made<lb/>no effect as yet.</p>
                        <p>Our situation is still miserable. Our ancestors have<lb/>been conquered,
                            immediately after you came on this<lb/>Island, by the strong Heroe, who
                            does still reign<lb/>among Indian tribes with tyranny, who has
                            robbed<lb/>us of every thing that was precious in our eyes.<lb/>We need
                            not mention every particular, how this<lb/>tyrant has used us, for your
                            eyes have been open to<lb/>behold our dismal situation.</p>
                        <p>By the power of our enemy our eyes have been<lb/>blinded; our young men
                            became willing slaves to<lb/>this despotic Heroe, so that we have
                            displeased the<lb/>good Spirit, and we could not become
                            civilized<lb/>people.</p>
                        <p>In looking back, we see nothing but desolation of<lb/>our mighty men; in
                            looking forward, we foresee the<lb/> desolation of our tribes. Our
                            Chiefs have used their<lb/>endeavours to reform their respective people,
                            but,<lb/>having seen no success, they seem discouraged, and<lb/>hang
                            down their heads.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—In remembrance of your kind promises,<lb/>we unite our cries to
                            you for help.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, you are ready to think whatman it must<lb/>be that have abused
                            so much of our brethren; never<lb/>was such Heroe, or tyrant, heard that
                            ever meddled<lb/>with Indians. But, in reality, he is your own
                            begot-<lb/>ten son, and his name you call Rum, and the names<lb/>of his
                            officers, are Brandy, Wine, and Gin, and we<lb/><pb n="114" facs="SW_TE1834_111"/>know that
                            you have the power to control him ; and,<lb/>as we desire to live in
                            peace, and to become civilized<lb/> nations, we earnestly entreat you to
                            use your power<lb/>and wisdom to prevent all people, whether white
                            or<lb/>black, who may cause the Rum, and the other spirit-<lb/>uous
                            liquors, to come in the hands of our tribes<lb/>throughout your State.
                            In compliance with this, our<lb/> request, we will acknowledge your
                            friendship.</p>

                        <p>Thy favour of <date when="1796-10-19">19th ultimo</date>, to <persName
                                key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>, is<lb/> now before us, with the
                            contents of which we are<lb/><pb n="115" facs="SW_TE1834_112"/>much pleased. The delay of the
                            buildings, and lay-<lb/>ing out the money designed for that, in articles
                            more<lb/> immediately necessary for the Indians, we think a<lb/>very
                            judicious step, as, while it will tend to convince<lb/>them how much we
                            wish to serve them, they will<lb/>also receive more immediate benefits.
                            We hope, by<lb/>this time, the goods proposed to be sent them
                            when<lb/>thou wast here, have reached them. Thou wilt ob-<lb/>serve
                            several additions to them, that were agreed to<lb/> before thou left us,
                            which was in consequence of our<lb/>interview with the Governor.</p>
                        <p>As the articles will, probably, be ready for distri-<lb/>bution before
                            thou comest away, thou mayest proba-<lb/>bly learn whether they are
                            suitably adapted to their<lb/>wants, and from thence form a judgment how
                            to<lb/> proceed in future. When suitable opportunity can be<lb/>had to
                            consult with them, we think there would be<lb/>a propriety in doing it.
                            And, therefore, as it is<lb/>probable, some supplies of clothing,
                            blankets, &amp;c.,<lb/>may be wanted for the winter season, it would
                            be<lb/>agreeable to us if thou wouldest endeavour to obtain<lb/>such
                            knowledge of the articles most necessary, and<lb/>furnish us with the
                            list thereof. We also think there<lb/> will be a propriety in making an
                            inquiry of them,<lb/>what it is probable they will want next season, as
                            that<lb/>will afford us time to procure the articles, both
                            in<lb/>quantity and quality, much better adapted to their<lb/> use, and,
                            perhaps, a saving. This spring, we found<lb/>much difficulty in
                            procuring some things, particularly<lb/>the hoes, axes, scythes,
                            &amp;c., some of which are short<lb/>of the quantity designed, and, we
                            fear, may also be<lb/> deficient in the quality, though we spared no
                            pains<lb/>to procure them of the most proper kinds.</p>
                        <p>If thou shouldest have another opportunity with<lb/> the Indians before
                            thy return, we wish to inform<lb/>them of our uniting with thee in what
                            thou hast done;<lb/>and we also unite in sentiment with thee, on
                            the<lb/>absolute necessity of their making <q><emph rend="italic">strait

                        <p>Since our last, we have been without any of<lb/>thy favours, and although
                            we much approved of what<lb/>thou didst, as being for the most immediate
                            benefit<lb/>of the Indians, and have paid the bills thou
                            drewest,<lb/>yet we have since had cause to regret furnishing<lb/>them
                            with any supplies, till their school house was<lb/>built. We now find
                            that the law expressly directs,<lb/>that the school house shall be first
                            built, and a mas-<lb/>ter provided, and until this is done, the Governor
                            is<lb/>restrained from handing us any more money than<lb/>may be thought
                            sufficient for those purposes. Of<lb/>course, when we called on him, in
                            expectation of<lb/>receiving the money, we could get none, as he
                            said<lb/>the house must be first completed, as the law directs.</p>
                        <p>We have now no way of being paid our advances,<lb/>but by setting about
                            and completing the school house<lb/>with all possible expedition ; and,
                            on consulting with<lb/>the Governor, we have approved of erecting only
                            a<lb/>school house at present, and, at a future time, erect<lb/>another
                            house, to serve for to transact their town<lb/>business in, and as a
                            meeting house. We have, there-<lb/>fore, with his approbation, changed
                            the plan of that<lb/>we sent thee, and, enclosed, thou wilt find one
                            calcu-<lb/>lated for a school house only. Near where the old<lb/>one
                            stands, on <emph rend="italic"><persName key="jtuhi1">John
                                    Tuhis</persName>'s land</emph>, is thought to be an<lb/>eligible
                            spot for the new house.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, if the Indians are informed that the Go-<lb/><pb n="117" facs="SW_TE1834_114"/>vernor
                            is restrained by law, from granting any farther<lb/>support to them,
                            until the house is finished, they will<lb/>generally turn out, and
                            endeavour by their exertions<lb/> to complete the building in a short
                            time.</p>
                        <p>We are of opinion, that logs be collected, and sawed<lb/>into pieces
                            about four or five inches thick, and as<lb/>wide as the timber will
                            admit of, to be placed on the<lb/>top of each other, and pinned and
                            dove-tailed toge-<lb/>ther. The building then to be boarded on the
                            outside,<lb/>with boards to stand upright, not lengthways.
                            These<lb/>boards may be planed, so as they can be painted,
                            if<lb/>thought necessary, at a future day. The roof to be<lb/>shingled;
                            the lower pieces of the building to be pitch<lb/>pine or white oak, to
                            prevent decay. The house<lb/>should stand about eighteen inches above
                            the ground,<lb/>underpinned with brick or stone, and till this can
                            be<lb/>done, it may remain, perhaps, till next year, supported<lb/>on
                            blocks. The floor should be pitch pine plank, or,<lb/>if not to be had,
                            of white pine, and ceiled above<lb/>with boards. The floor and ceiling
                            should be grooved,<lb/>but need not to be planed.</p>
                        <p>On this plan we wish thee to procure as many men<lb/>as can work, and to
                            proceed immediately, and erect<lb/>a house in the most convenient
                            situation that can be<lb/>obtained; and thou wilt readily see the
                            necessity of<lb/>sending us an acoount of the cost thereof, as soon
                            as<lb/>it can be ascertained, which, if some part is done by<lb/>the
                            job, may be done even before the building is<lb/>finished. Thou wilt
                            please engage young <persName key="ewamp1">Wampey</persName>,<lb/> or
                            some other, for a master, at a stipulated salary,<lb/>until we can
                            procure one that may be better quali-<lb/>fied.</p>
                        <p>The Governor agrees to advance us five hundred<lb/>dollars towards
                            erecting the proposed house; but thou<lb/>wilt remember, no more can be
                            got till the building<lb/>is finished, or the cost thereof known, so as
                            to report<lb/>it to the Governor. It will be also necessary,
                            that<lb/>thou sendest us an account of articles purchased for,<lb/> and
                            supplied to, the Indians.</p>

                        <p>Thou mayest readily procure money for going on<lb/>with the building,
                            from any of the store keepers, for<lb/>bills on us, which we would be
                            glad thou couldest<lb/>make at thirty days' sight, if in thy power. It

                        <p> Grandfather—When I look on you, I see your tears<lb/>flowing down from
                            your eyes, on account of the dust<lb/>that flew about on the way, as you
                            were coming<lb/>from your fire-place hither.</p>
                        <p>In remembrance of the ancient customs of our<lb/>ancestors, I now stretch
                            forth my hand, and wipe off<lb/>your tears, that you may see your

                            grand-<lb/>children, and also clean your throat, and loose
                            your<lb/>tongue, that you may speak freely.</p>
                        <p>Grandfather—And also I find that your heart is<lb/> hanging downwards, on
                            account of the many losses<lb/>in your Nation these many days; and,
                            according to<lb/>the customs of our forefathers, I now set your
                            heart<lb/>upright, and lay aside all the sound which the white<lb/>birds
                            have sounded on your ears, that you may, with-<lb/>out prejudice, be

                        <p>Grandfather—Having done so much, then I see<lb/>mud all over your legs
                            and feet, for an account of<lb/>the long muddy path in which you have
                            walked<lb/>through. I now wash your legs and feet, but still
                            I<lb/>discover some briars and thorns sticking fast in your<lb/>feet;
                            now I pull out every one of them, and I take<lb/><emph rend="italic"

                        <p> I am glad to find that you still retain our talk, <lb/><pb n="120" facs="SW_TE1834_117"/>
                            which passed between us at <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>, when we<lb/>saw each other there, (about
                            four years ago,) at which<lb/>time I took hold on your hand, and
                            directed you to<lb/>my fire-place, which invitations our Chiefs, with
                            our<lb/> young men, do now renew.</p>
                        <p>I spread this <emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="del"
                                    >unnukkcon</foreign></emph>, or mat, wide, on which I<lb/>put
                            you; likewise those pillows to lay your heads<lb/>on; then I stretch
                            forth my hand on your fire-place,<lb/>and roll your mat, which you used
                            to sit on, and<lb/>spread it over on the other mat, which I just
                            made<lb/>ready for you, that you may feel more easy and
                            com-<lb/>fortable; here you will eat with your grandchildren<lb/>out of
                            one dish, and use one spoon; by the side of<lb/> this fire-place you can
                            cook what you please, and at<lb/>night you can lay down to rest, and
                            dream about the<lb/>welfare of your men, women, and children. In
                            the<lb/>morning you can get up, and promote the same.</p>
                        <p> Grandfather—Lastly, I let you know that I put a<lb/>broom by the side of
                            this bed, so that, whenever you<lb/>feel something hard on this bed,
                            then when shall<lb/>use the broom to sweep off every thing, that
                            nothing<lb/>may interrupt your rest.</p>
                        <p>(<foreign xml:lang="del">Nunnchtkchk</foreign>. String of wampum
                            delivered.)</p>
                        <p> Grandfather—once more attend.</p>
                        <p> We will now let you know the reasons which in-<lb/>duce your
                            grandchildren to give you such invitations.</p>
                        <p> 1st. Because I believe that it is the will of the<lb/>great Good Spirit,
                            that our ancestors did enter into<lb/>covenant, and established a strong
                            friendship between<lb/> them, which covenant we ever have
                            maintained<lb/>bright.</p>
                        <p>2d. Because, by the goodness of the same Spirit,<lb/>we obtained this
                            good dish, wherein we may eat<lb/>peaceably; and, by his kind
                            providence, we were en-<lb/>abled to see your dismal situation; and
                            farther, I<lb/>believe, that it is the same good Spirit who
                            influenced<lb/>our hearts to have the compassionate feelings
                            towards<lb/>your Nation.</p>
                        <p>3d. Because I believe, that if you can only once<lb/><pb n="121" facs="SW_TE1834_118"/> make
                            out to bring the whole of your Nation here,<lb/> you can have better
                            chance to try to live as a people,<lb/>because this dish is much better
                            than your old dish.</p>
                        <p>4th. Because you will have the privilege of hear-<lb/>ing the glad
                            tidings of the Gospel preached, and your<lb/>children will be instructed
                            to read and write.</p>
                        <p>5th. Because here we can live together as one<lb/>family, and counsel one
                            another, and comfort<lb/>and exhort one another daily, so long as we are
                            allowed<lb/>to live this side of eternity.</p>

                        <p>I am glad that, by the goodness of the Great<lb/>Spirit, we were allowed
                            to meet together by the side<lb/>of this fire-place, to smoke the pipe
                            of friendship, as<lb/>our ancestors were accustomed to do.
                            Grandchildren,<lb/>I am glad to find a token of your friendship,
                            which<lb/>you manifested at your grandfather's arrival at
                            this<lb/>fire-place; likewise, ever since, for which we
                            are<lb/>extremely thankful, and ever shall be gratefully
                            re-<lb/>membered.</p>
                        <p>Grandchildren—At our arrival, you wiped away<lb/>the tears from our eyes,
                            which were caused by the<lb/>filth and dust which blew into them in our
                            long<lb/>journey, as also, on the account of the many tall<lb/>trees,
                            which are fallen and lost amongst us. Like-<lb/>wise, you have cleared
                            out my ears and throat, and<lb/>set my heart upright. Likewise, you have
                            wiped off <lb/><pb n="122" facs="SW_TE1834_119"/>the mud from my legs and feet, and, finding
                            them<lb/>full of briars and thorns, you reached thither your<lb/>hands,
                            and plucked them all out, and applied the<lb/>healing oil of our
                            deceased ancestors upon them.</p>
                        <p>Grandchildren—Since your performance of this<lb/> kindness to your
                            grandfather, I see you clearly; I<lb/>see the tears running down on your
                            eyes, on the<lb/>account of the many losses in your Nation, and
                            the<lb/>many high trees that are fallen.</p>
                        <p>Grandchildren—Now, in remembrance of our an-<lb/>cient covenant, I
                            stretch forth my hands, and raise<lb/>up your head, and obliterate from
                            your eyes and mind<lb/>all tears and sorrow, and fix your eyes forward,
                            that<lb/>they may not be obstructed from looking forward<lb/>on the
                            happy days which are coming, in looking back<lb/>on the trees which are
                            fallen.</p>
                        <p>Grandchildren—I also cleanse your ears, that you<lb/>may hear plainly ;
                            and strengthen your tongues, that<lb/>you may be enabled to speak the
                            things which are<lb/>profitable for your Nation, both temporally and
                            spi-<lb/>ritually. Likewise, I set your heart upright, that you<lb/>may
                            be capable of contemplating the welfare and<lb/>happiness of your old
                            men, women, and children.</p>
                        <p>Now, Grandchildren, attend.</p>
                        <p>By these strings you renew the kind invitation<lb/>you gave us, when we
                            saw each other in <placeName key="phila">Philadel-<lb/>phia</placeName>.
                            I think it needless to repeat the same, but for<lb/>which we again thank
                            you. Likewise, Grandchil-<lb/>dren, be it known unto you, that we have
                            deeply<lb/> considered your invitation, and finding it
                            heartily<lb/>sincere, and your dish a lasting good one, and your<lb/>
                            paths so good and straight, we accept of your invi-<lb/>tation, and lay
                            hold on it with both of our hands,<lb/>hoping that the great Good Spirit
                            may enable and<lb/>protect us, in promoting each other's welfare
                            and<lb/>happiness, and that we may live and die together by<lb/> the
                            side of your fire-place.</p>
                        <p>Now, Grandchildren, I must tell you, now that I<lb/>am about turning my
                            eyes towards my fire-place,<lb/><pb n="123" facs="SW_TE1834_120"/> hoping that, as you have
                            begun and entered in this<lb/>good path, you may stiil continue to
                            persevere there-<lb/>in ; and although we shall be absent some time
                            in<lb/>body, our hearts shall still be present with you.</p>

                            causes them to give us light—that Great<lb/>Spirit and common Father of

                            should<lb/>do one another all the good we can; and it is on<lb/>this

                            our local settlements<lb/>in the world, or whatever difference there may
                            be in<lb/>our colour. And, as we are convinced it is not in<lb/>our
                            power to perform our religious duties to Him<lb/>that hath created us,
                            without his assistance, so we<lb/>conceive it to be our duty, when we
                            are about to<lb/>enter upon such weighty business as, I apprehend, this
                            is,<lb/>thus to sit down in stillness, in order to endeavour<lb/>to feel
                            after the operation of his spirit in our hearts;<lb/>and we believe that
                            this cannot be attained by our <lb/><pb n="125" facs="SW_TE1834_122"/> own natural powers,
                            but must be under the influence<lb/>of the Good Spirit.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that there is an evil spirit, which<lb/>is always
                            striving to lead us into wrong things: that<lb/> spirit which leads us
                            to hate and destroy one another;<lb/>and in this persuasion of mind, we
                            believe it neces-<lb/>sary for us to sit down in stillness and quiet, to
                            wait<lb/>upon the Great Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Under these impressions, we are concerned often<lb/>to assemble ourselves
                            together, that we may indivi-<lb/>dually come under an exercise and
                            concern, to be<lb/>rightly directed in our religious movements;
                            and<lb/>once in the year we assemble at certain places, in<lb/>order to
                            have a general and full conference, to know<lb/> how things are amongst
                            us as a people.</p>
                        <p>One of these meetings is held at <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>, and<lb/>another at <placeName key="balt1"

                        <p>At our <orgName key="bym">yearly meeting at <placeName key="balt1"
                                    >Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, several years<lb/>past, our
                            minds were brought under a concern on<lb/>behalf of our brethren, the
                            Indians; and remember-<lb/>ing the friendship that had subsisted between
                            our<lb/>society and the Indians, from the first settlement of<lb/>our
                            fathers upon this continent, and at the same time<lb/>recollecting that
                            the country to the westward was<lb/>fast settling, apprehensions arose
                            in our mind, that,<lb/>as the game became scarce, they would be
                            brought<lb/>under sufferings; and, as there had been long
                            wars<lb/>between some of the white people and the Indians,<lb/>we had
                            not had, for a long time, an opportunity of<lb/>taking our brothers, the
                            Indians, by the hand.</p>
                        <p>Now, brothers, as we are thus led by the concerns<lb/>that arose in our
                            council, some of us were appointed<lb/>to go out into the wilderness,
                            and endeavour to get<lb/>amongst our brethren, the Indians, that we
                            might<lb/>have some talk with them; and amongst those who<lb/> were
                            appointed, this, my brother, who sits at my<lb/>right hand, was one; and
                            I have thought that he,<lb/>perhaps, can give a more full account, both
                            of the<lb/>times, and of our first movements at the concern. </p>

                        <p> About six years ago, we believe, the Good Spirit<lb/>put into our
                            hearts, at our great council, held in this<lb/>town, to endeavour to do
                            something for the Indians;<lb/>and, about four years ago, two others,
                            besides myself,<lb/>went over the Great Mountains, westward, in
                            order<lb/>to see your situation, and to know your
                            disposition,<lb/>whether you would receive any thing from us or not.</p>
                        <p>We wished to go to <placeName key="sand">Sandusky</placeName>, expecting
                            to find<lb/>the greatest number of Indians at that place. We<lb/>could
                            not get a guide till we got to the forks of <geogName key="sciot"
                                >Scioto</geogName>,<lb/>where we agreed with one to take us to
                                <persName key="izane1">Isaac<lb/> Zane's</persName>. At that place,
                            we were informed that a<lb/>number of chiefs were at <placeName
                                key="detro">Detroit</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>We sent for some <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> chiefs, who
                            resided<lb/> about 25 miles from <persName key="izane1">Isaac
                                Zane</persName>'s, and had a confer-<lb/>ence with them. We informed
                            them of the desire<lb/>our society had, to do something for the Indians
                            that<lb/> would be useful to them. From thence we went to<lb/><placeName
                                key="usand">Upper Sandusky</placeName>. <persName key="izane1">Isaac
                                Zane</persName> piloted us, and there,<lb/> also, we had a
                            conference with some of the <orgName key="delaware"
                            >Delaware</orgName><lb/> chiefs. We wanted to know whether they
                            would<lb/>be willing to be instructed, on their own lands, in<lb/>a way
                            to procure a sufficiency for them to eat; to<lb/> have a mill to grind
                            their corn, and have their chil-<lb/>dren instructed to read and write?
                            They informed<lb/>us, that they could not give us an answer at that
                            time,<lb/>but would lay our proposals before their council.</p>
                        <p>About three years ago, we received a speech and<lb/>a belt of wampum from
                            a council held at <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>;<lb/>the
                            speech did not contain an answer to the propo-<lb/>sals made to them,
                            but an invitation to us to attend<lb/>their council. (A short

                        <p>Two years, last Spring, seven of us went over<lb/> the <geogName

                            to be held till<lb/>about two weeks after. Not being accustomed
                            to<lb/>their mode of living, and finding a considerable num-<lb/>ber of
                            the Indians, at that place, intoxicated with<lb/>liquor, we were much
                            discouraged, and concluded<lb/>we might as well return home again. The
                            Indians,<lb/>however, notwithstanding their situation, treated
                            us<lb/>very kindly. We got together several Chiefs of the<lb/><orgName

                        <p>We were glad when we heard, that some of our<lb/>red brethren were come
                            to this city, and felt our<lb/>minds drawn to take them by the hand, in
                            order that<lb/>we might have an opportunity of knowing them.</p>
                        <p> As we had not been acquainted with their situa-<lb/><pb n="128" facs="SW_TE1834_125"/>tions
                            and circumstances, we have not been able to<lb/> judge, whether any
                            thing we had to propose to do<lb/> for them, would be accepted?—Whether
                            they were<lb/> under the necessity of applying to some other mode<lb/>
                            for a livelihood ?—Whether the game in their coun-<lb/>try was in
                            plenty?—We have thought, brothers, that<lb/>if it should not yet be the
                            case, that the game is<lb/> scarce, it probably will be the case at some
                            time;<lb/>and, therefore, we thought it would be best for our<lb/>red
                            brethren, to give some attention to the cultiva-<lb/>tion of the
                            soil.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the subjects which has claimed our<lb/>consideration. And,
                            feeling in our hearts, that we<lb/>loved the Indians, and wished their
                            welfare, it was<lb/>our concern that they might be instructed to
                            turn<lb/>their attention to the cultivation of their lands. And,<lb/>as
                            we believe, brothers, that we derive very great<lb/>advantages from
                            reading books, which contain much<lb/>instruction, and wishing our
                            brethren, the Indians,<lb/>should also derive the same advantage with
                            us, we<lb/>have wished that they should candidly let us
                            know,<lb/>whether they desire these things, that we might do<lb/>for
                            them whatever is in our power to do.</p>

                        <p>Friends and Brothers—Your red brethren believe, <lb/><pb n="129" facs="SW_TE1834_126"/>that
                            one man—one Great Man, made all the men that<lb/> are on the earth; and

                            of.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—It appears to us, your red<lb/> brethren, that you

                            We have been <lb/>led astray by inferior spirits; we now hope,

                        <p>Brothers and Friends—The long and destructive<lb/>wars that have raged in

                            among them,<lb/>have caused their numbers to be greatly
                            diminished.<lb/>Those that have come amongst us, have very

                        <p>Friends and Brothers—We find that you are now<lb/>disposed, with open

                            together with the<lb/> great chief of the white people, whom we are
                            now<lb/>about to apply to for help.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—At the treaty of <placeName key="greenv"
                                >Grenville</placeName>,<lb/> which is now a little past six years
                            ago, we received<lb/>some presents, by the hands of the great war chief
                            of<lb/> the Americans, (<persName key="gwayn1">General
                            Wayne</persName>,) said to be sent to us<lb/>by our brothers, the
                            Quakers. After this treaty, I<lb/>was invited, by the great chiefs of
                            the Americans,<lb/> to visit them. It is now four years since I
                            visited<lb/>them, at <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>,
                            whilst the great council was<lb/>held at that city. I had there
                            opportunity to see our<lb/>brothers, the Quakers, and received from
                            their mouths<lb/><pb n="130" facs="SW_TE1834_127"/>some talks: all these talks I wrapped up
                            in my heart,<lb/>and, when I returned home to my brothers, I
                            com-<lb/>municated to them, faithfully, all those good things<lb/>which
                            you had told us you were desirous to do for us.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers—I am happy to say, that<lb/> these, my red brothers,
                            now present with me, are<lb/>chiefs, who, in their own country, are
                            equally great<lb/>with myself. They were rejoiced to hear
                            your<lb/>words, delivered to them, through me, four years ago,<lb/>and
                            they are now equally glad with myself, to hear<lb/>from the mouths of
                            our brothers, the Quakers, the<lb/>same good words again.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—If we understand you right,<lb/>you wish to add
                            comfort to our women and children,<lb/> by teaching us some of your ways
                            of living. I am<lb/>glad that the Great Spirit has put this into
                            your<lb/>hearts, and am sorry that your exertions have not<lb/>yet been
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—I now assure you, that you<lb/>hear the voice of the
                                <orgName key="potaw">Patawattamy</orgName>, <orgName key="miami"
                                >Miami</orgName>, <orgName key="delaware">Delaware</orgName>,<lb/>
                            <orgName key="shawnee">Shawanese</orgName>, <orgName key="wea"
                                >Weas</orgName>, <orgName key="eel">Eel River</orgName>, <orgName

                                >Kickapoo</orgName>,<lb/> and <orgName key="kaska"
                                >Kaskaskias</orgName> tribes of Indians, and that, if you<lb/>wish
                            to do any thing for any of these nations of<lb/>Indians, they will be
                            ready, at all times, to receive<lb/>you—and we, also, will be ready, at
                            all times, to ren-<lb/>der you any assistance in our power.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—This is the first time that<lb/>the Great Spirit has
                            brought us to take our brethren,<lb/>the <orgName key="bym">Quakers of
                                    <placeName key="balt1">Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, by the
                            hand, and we re-<lb/>joice to hear them mention the same things to
                            us,<lb/> that have heretofore been mentioned to us, by our<lb/>
                            brothers, the <orgName key="pym">Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                    >Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—I, some time past, received from our<lb/> brothers, the <orgName
                                key="pym">Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>, some tools,<lb/> amongst which
                            were two ploughs. I used them, and<lb/>did all I could to keep them from
                            wearing out. I was<lb/>pleased with them: they have now become
                            necessary<lb/>to be repaired. We have nobody amongst us that<lb/>can
                            mend them, and they are now useless to me. </p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="SW_TE1834_128"/>
                        <p> Brothers and Friends—It is now five days since<lb/>we took our brothers,
                            the <orgName key="pym">Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                    >Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>,<lb/>by the hand—we then
                            talked over these things to-<lb/>gether. They have promised me, that at
                            their next<lb/>great council, they will hold a talk about these
                            things,<lb/>and consider what they can do for us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—If our brothers, the <orgName key="bym"
                                >Quakers<lb/>of <placeName key="balt1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, desire to do any thing for the
                            Indians, I<lb/>wish to give them full information of the place
                            where<lb/>we may be found generally together. The great<lb/>council of
                            our tribes of Indians, is held at <placeName key="fwayn">Fort
                                Wayne</placeName>,<lb/>at the time we receive our annuity from the
                            United<lb/>States. At that time, any communications our
                            brothers<lb/>wish to make to their red brethren, will be
                            safely<lb/>handed to us by your white brother, our interpreter,<lb/>now
                            with us, who is our agent at that place. (He<lb/>then sat down, but,
                            after a short pause arose again.)</p>
                        <p>Brothers—I must add a few words farther: I find<lb/>that I have not fully
                            answered all the questions that<lb/>our brothers have put to us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—It is the real wish of your<lb/>brothers, the
                            Indians, to engage in the cultivation of<lb/>our lands. And although the
                            game is not yet so<lb/>scarce, but that we can get enough to eat, we
                            know<lb/>it is becoming scarce, and that we must begin to<lb/>take hold
                            of such tools as we see are in the hands of<lb/>the white people.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—We are now on our way to<lb/>see the great chiefs of
                            the Americans at their council.<lb/>We are glad to find that they
                            remember their red<lb/>brethren, and rejoice to believe that the Great
                            Spirit<lb/>has put it into the heart of the great chief of the<lb/>white
                            people to do us such services as will add to the<lb/>comfort of his red
                            children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—I will now only add, that<lb/>I rejoice to believe,
                            that your friendship to your red<lb/>brethren is a friendship that is
                            pure—a friendship<lb/>that comes from the heart—you want no
                            compensa-<lb/>tion from the Indians for your services to them. You
                            <lb/><pb n="132" facs="SW_TE1834_129"/>do not want to take away our lands from
                            us—you<lb/>have always made use of this language to us; and<lb/>it has
                            always been with pleasure that I have com-<lb/>municated it to our
                            brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—We are a jealously disposed people—al-<lb/>most every white man
                            that comes amongst us, endea-<lb/>vours all he can to cheat us; this has
                            occasioned jea-<lb/>lousy among us. But your talks, brothers, are
                            different;<lb/>we believe you, when you say you want no
                            compensa-<lb/>tion from us, for your services to your red brethren.</p>

                        <p>I rejoice to hear that you have so much compas-<lb/>sion on your red
                            brethren. As my friend the <persName key="lturt1"
                                >Little<lb/>Turtle</persName> has observed, it is not the first time
                            that we<lb/>have received tokens of friendship from you.</p>
                        <p>It is some years since the treaty of <placeName key="greenv"
                                >Grenville</placeName>,<lb/> where we first experienced the
                            friendship of our<lb/>brothers, the Quakers. He was there informed
                            of<lb/>their good wishes, and of the great friendship they<lb/>had for
                            their red brethren.</p>
                        <p>He returned home, and informed us of all the great<lb/>talks he had with
                            our brothers, the <orgName key="pym">Quakers of<lb/><placeName
                                    key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>.</p>
                        <p>It is truly pleasing to me, brothers, to hear the<lb/>same talks my
                            friend had informed me of, now<lb/> repeated, on my arrival at
                                <placeName key="balt1">Baltimore</placeName>, by our friends<lb/>and
                            brothers the Quakers.</p>
                        <p>I hope, brothers, that the Great Spirit, who has the<lb/>disposal of men,
                            will assist you in your laudable<lb/>undertakings, and enable you to be
                            of service to your<lb/>red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers—The talks that you have<lb/>now delivered to us,
                            shall be carefully collected,<lb/>wrapped up, and put in our hearts—we
                            will not<lb/>forget them. On our return home, we will have<lb/>them
                            communicated from the head to the mouth of<lb/>the <geogName key="wabas"
                                >Wabash</geogName>—from this to the <geogName key="missi"

                            strikes the lakes, thence round by <placeName key="michi"
                                >Michili-<lb/>mackanack</placeName>, until they come back again to
                            the same<lb/>place.</p>
                        <p>What we say to you, you may he assured does not<lb/>come from one man, it
                            comes from many—and what<lb/>you have now said to us, you speak it to
                            but a few,<lb/>but it shall be communicated to many.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—I observed to our friends the<lb/><orgName key="pym"
                                >Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>, five days ago, what I
                            now<lb/>say to you: That we wish our brothers, the Quakers,<lb/>to
                            render us those services which they have proposed.<lb/>We promise that
                            nothing shall be wanting on our<lb/>part, to give aid to so desirable a
                            thing in our country.</p>
                        <p>Our situation, at present, will not admit of carrying<lb/>such a plan so
                            fully into execution as might be<lb/>desired by our brothers; but that,
                            I hope, will not<lb/>prevent you from making trial. If we had such<lb/>
                            tools as you make use of, and which add so much to<lb/>your comfort—for
                            we have been lost in wonder at<lb/>what we have seen amongst you—if we
                            had these<lb/>instruments, we should, I hope, be willing to
                            use<lb/>them; and in the course of a little time, there would<lb/>be
                            people amongst us, that would know well how<lb/>to use them, through the
                            assistance they might<lb/>obtain from you, and the rest of our white
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—Whatever goods you may<lb/>have in store for your
                            red brothers, we cannot but<lb/>wish that you will show them to us as
                            soon as pos-<lb/>sible.</p>
                        <p>That we can yet live upon the game of our country<lb/>is true; but we
                            know that this will not be the case<lb/>long. Brothers, from the great
                            things, and the aston-<lb/>ishing wonders which we have seen among you,
                            and<lb/>finding they all come out of the earth, it makes me<lb/>anxious
                            to try if I cannot get some for myself. I<lb/> hope, brothers, that by
                            the aid of the Great Spirit,<lb/>and of our friends and brothers, the
                            Quakers, together<lb/>with the government of the United States, that
                            we<lb/>shall yet be enabled to get these good things for our-<lb/><pb
                                n="134" facs="SW_TE1834_131"/>selves—such as will make us, our women, and
                            our<lb/>children happy.</p>
                        <p>Brothers—We do not know what our brothers, the<lb/><orgName key="pym"
                                >Quakers of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>, may have in
                            contemplation<lb/>to do for their red brethren, but we hope it will
                            be<lb/>something that will add to our comfort; we hope<lb/>it will be
                            something by which we shall profit; some-<lb/>thing by which we shall be
                            enabled to cultivate our<lb/>lands, and live by the fruits of the earth.
                            We have<lb/>been walking in a thorny path; we want to get into<lb/>your
                            track and follow it; and the sooner this is<lb/>put into our power, I am
                            convinced the better it will<lb/>be for our red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—I have not much to say<lb/>further; what has now
                            been said to you is the voice<lb/>of the <orgName key="potaw"

                                <orgName key="kaska">Kaskas-<lb/>kias</orgName> tribes of Indians. I
                            rejoice, brothers, that we<lb/>now know each other, and hope if you have
                            any<lb/>thing to communicate to your red brethren, that it<lb/>will come
                            to us through your good brother, <persName key="wwell1"
                                >William<lb/>Wells</persName>, our interpreter, who resides in our
                            country.<lb/>We can place great confidence in him. He is the
                            only<lb/>white man in our country we will trust; we shall<lb/>then get
                            it, and do now assure you, that it shall be<lb/>faithfully sent to all
                            these people, in the manner you<lb/>wish it to be.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—I hope the Great Spirit will<lb/> assist you in your
                            undertakings to do your red<lb/>brethren good. Your movements towards
                            the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyan-<lb/>dots</orgName>, have not met with
                            that success which they<lb/>deserved. It makes me sorry to find an
                            answer from<lb/>them of the kind you have mentioned. There is
                            a<lb/>great deal, brothers, in having a good interpreter,<lb/>and
                            beginning at the right end of the business.</p>

                        <p>When the talks, which we had last evening at<lb/> this place, ended, I
                            believe it was generally under-<lb/>stood, that the subject matter which
                            had been<lb/>spoken upon, was satisfactory; but, on considering
                            fur-<lb/>ther, some of us thought that there were some things<lb/>of
                            considerable importance, which had not been<lb/>spoken upon—and thought
                            that it would be right<lb/>to have another opportunity.</p>
                        <p>We are, accordingly, again assembled—and, see-<lb/>ing that it has been
                            the will of the Great Spirit, and<lb/>Father of us all, to permit us
                            thus to come together<lb/>again, it is my desire that any thing we may
                            feel<lb/>in our hearts, that may be likely to have a tendency<lb/>to
                            promote the good of our red brethren, may be freely<lb/>spoken.</p>

                        <p>I may tell you, I have been made glad, that I have<lb/>an opportunity of
                            sitting once more with you; and<lb/>as I have found, that the more I am
                            with you, the<lb/>more the love I have felt for you has increased,
                            and<lb/>the stronger has been my desire for your welfare,<lb/>and that
                            this love has taken away all fear of giving<lb/>offence; I feel myself
                            authorized, I think, as a bro<lb/>ther, to use freedom of speech with
                            you, and in the<lb/> freedom which I feel, under the influence of
                            that<lb/>love which, I trust, has been impressed upon my<lb/>heart by
                            the Great and Good Spirit, who, as he has<lb/>made us all of one blood,
                            so he requires of us, that<lb/>we should love one another. I may tell
                            you, brothers,<lb/>that, when I was in the Indian country, I had
                            fre-<lb/>quent opportunities of observing the pernicious
                            con-<lb/>sequences of the use of spirituous liquors, with which <lb/><pb
                                n="136" facs="SW_TE1834_133"/>the Indians were furnished by the traders; and as I<lb/>
                            have reason to believe, that you who are now present<lb/>are wise men,
                            who have eyes in your heads, and are<lb/>able to see things as they
                            really are, I have felt a<lb/>desire in my heart to know your opinions,
                            and what<lb/>is your judgment concerning this thing—the
                            using<lb/>spirituous liquors to excess; believing, brothers, that<lb/>if
                            you have seen things in the same light in which I<lb/>have seen them,
                            that you would be desirous that a<lb/>stop might be put to the evils,
                            that arise from the use<lb/>of so destructive a liquor. I may tell you,
                            brothers,<lb/>who are now present, as well as the Indians in<lb/>
                            general, that I have believed that there is not any<lb/>thing that
                            stands more in your way to improvement<lb/>than this, the too frequent
                            use of spirituous liquors:<lb/>and I have thought, that if you are of
                            the same mind<lb/> with us, who are your friends, and have your
                            good<lb/>at heart, that it would be right for us to take the<lb/>subject
                            into our serious consideration, to endeavour<lb/>to discover, whether
                            there may not be some step<lb/>taken, that would put a check upon this
                            pernicious<lb/>thing.</p>
                        <p>Now, brothers, as a hint of this sort was omitted<lb/>when we were
                            together last evening, some of us did<lb/>not find our minds easy: we
                            thought it ought to<lb/> have come under consideration, hoping that you,
                            who,<lb/>as I have already said, have eyes in your heads, and<lb/>can
                            see for yourselves, have had this subject under<lb/>your consideration.
                            We now hope, brothers, that<lb/>you will express yourselves freely to us
                            on this sub-<lb/>ject, and let us know how it has happened to
                            you.<lb/>After which, perhaps, it will open a way for some<lb/> further
                            observations from us.</p>

                        <p>I am happy to find, that it has pleased the Great<lb/>Spirit, that we
                            should again, this evening, meet in<lb/>the same house, in which we held
                            our council yester-<lb/>day. I am happy to find, that it is the will of
                            the<lb/>Great and Good Spirit, that we should discover, there<lb/>was
                            something yesterday not mentioned, that was<lb/>highly necessary for the
                            welfare of your brethren.</p>
                        <p>Friends and Brothers—I am glad to find that it has<lb/>pleased the Great
                            Spirit, to put a wish in your hearts,<lb/>to know our opinions on the
                            subject you have men-<lb/>tioned ; a subject of the greatest moment to
                            us.<lb/>What you have said, relative to our being one flesh,<lb/>and one
                            blood, is true. Your brothers, the Indians,<lb/>believe, that it is in
                            this light the Great Spirit con-<lb/>siders all mankind.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—My brother chiefs, that are<lb/>now present, with
                            myself, are happy to find, that you<lb/>have a good opinion of us. You
                            say, that you ap-<lb/>prehend we have eyes in our heads, and can
                            clearly<lb/>see for ourselves, those things that are injurious to
                            us.<lb/>This, my friends and brothers, is the case; we clearly<lb/>see
                            these things: my brother chiefs, that are now<lb/> present with me, as
                            well as myself, have long seen<lb/>them; we have long lamented these
                            great evils that<lb/>have raged in our country, and that have done
                            your<lb/>red brethren so much harm; we have applied for<lb/>redress, and
                            endeavoured to have them removed from<lb/>amongst us.</p>
                        <p>When our forefathers met first on this Island, your<lb/>red brethren then
                            were numerous; but since the<lb/>introduction amongst us of what you
                            call spirituous<lb/>liquors, and what, we think, may be justly
                            called<lb/>poison, our numbers are greatly diminished: it
                            has<lb/>destroyed a great part of our red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad to hear you<lb/>observe, that freedom
                            of speech ought always to be<lb/>made use of amongst brothers; this,
                            brothers, really<lb/>ought to be the case. I will now, therefore,
                            take<lb/><pb n="138" facs="SW_TE1834_135"/>the liberty to mention, that most of the
                            existing<lb/>evils amongst your red brethren, have been caught<lb/>from
                            the white people; not only that liquor that<lb/>destroys us daily, but
                            many diseases that our fore-<lb/>fathers were ignorant of, before they
                            saw you.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad, with my<lb/>brother chiefs, that are
                            now present, to find that you<lb/>are ready to assist us in every thing
                            that will add to<lb/>our good: we hope that the Great Spirit will aid
                            you<lb/>in all your good undertakings, with respect to us.<lb/>We
                            plainly perceive, brothers, that you see that very<lb/>evil that
                            destroys your red brethren. It is not an<lb/> evil, brothers, of our own
                            making; we have not<lb/>placed it amongst ourselves; it is an evil
                            placed<lb/>amongst us by the white people; we look up to them<lb/>to
                            remove it out of our country: if they have that<lb/>friendship for us,
                            which they tell us they have, they<lb/>certainly will not let it
                            continue amongst us any<lb/>longer. Our repeated entreaties to those who
                            bring<lb/>this evil amongst us, we find, has not the desired<lb/>effect.
                            We tell them—Brothers, fetch us useful things;<lb/>bring goods that will
                            clothe us, our women, and our<lb/>children, and not this evil liquor,
                            that destroys our<lb/> reason—that destroys our health—that destroys
                            our<lb/>lives: but all we can say on the subject is of no ser-<lb/>vice,
                            nor gives relief to your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—I am glad that you<lb/>have seen into this
                            business as we do—I rejoice to<lb/>find that you agree in opinion with
                            us, and express<lb/>an anxiety to be, if possible, of service to us, to
                            remove<lb/>this great evil out of our country—an evil that has<lb/>had
                            so much room in it—that has destroyed so many<lb/>of our lives, that it
                            causes our young men to say, <said who="undetermined">we<lb/>had better
                                be at war with the white people: this<lb/>liquor that they introduce
                                into our country is more<lb/>to be feared than the gun and the
                                tomahawk; there<lb/>are more of us dead since the treaty of
                                    <placeName key="greenv">Grenville</placeName>,<lb/>than we lost
                                by the six years war before; it is all<lb/>owing to the introduction
                                of this liquor amongst us.</said><lb/>
                            <pb n="139" facs="SW_TE1834_136"/> Brothers, how to remove this evil from our country<lb/>we
                            do not know; if we had known it to be a proper<lb/>subject to have
                            mentioned to you in our council<lb/>yesterday, we should surely have
                            done it. This<lb/> subject, brothers, composes a part of what we
                            intend<lb/>to make known to the great council of our white<lb/>brethren.
                            On our arrival there we shall endeavour<lb/>to explain to our great
                            father, the President; a great<lb/>many evils that have arisen in our
                            country, from the<lb/>introduction of this liquor by the white
                            traders.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends—In addition to what I have<lb/>before observed of
                            this great evil in the country of<lb/>your red brethren, I will say
                            further, that it has<lb/>made us poor. It is this liquor that causes our
                            young<lb/>men to go without clothes, our women and children<lb/>to go
                            without any thing to eat; and sorry am I to<lb/>mention now to you,
                            brothers, that the evil is increas-<lb/>ing every day, as the white
                            settlers come nearer to<lb/>us, and bring those kettles they boil that
                            stuff in<lb/>they call whiskey, of which our young men are
                            so<lb/>extremely fond. Brothers, when our young men<lb/>have been out
                            hunting, and are returning home load-<lb/>ed with skins and furs, on
                            their way, if it happens<lb/>that they come along where some of this
                            whiskey<lb/>is deposited, the white man who sells it, tells them<lb/>to
                            take a little drink; some of them will say no, I<lb/> don't want it—they
                            go on till they come to another<lb/>house, where they find more of this
                            same kind of<lb/>drink; it is there again offered; they refuse; and
                            again<lb/>the third time; but finally the fourth or fifth time<lb/> one
                            accepts of it, and takes a drink, and getting<lb/>one he wants another,
                            and then a third and a fourth,<lb/>till his senses have left him. After
                            his reason comes<lb/>back again to him, when he gets up and finds
                            where<lb/>he is, he asks for his peltry: the answer is, you
                            have<lb/>drank them. Where is my gun? It is gone. Where<lb/>is my
                            blanket? It is gone. Where is my shirt? You<lb/> have sold it for
                            whiskey!! Now, brothers, figure to<lb/>yourselves what a condition this
                            man must be in; he <lb/><pb n="140" facs="SW_TE1834_137"/>has a family at home, a wife and
                            children that stand<lb/>in need of the profits of his hunting: what
                            must<lb/>their wants be, when he himself is even without a<lb/>
                            shirt?</p>
                        <p>This, brothers, I can assure you, is a fact that<lb/>often happens among
                            us. As I have before observed,<lb/>we have no means to prevent it. If
                            you, brothers,<lb/>have it in your power to render us any
                            assistance,<lb/>we hope the Great Spirit will aid you. We shall
                            lay<lb/>these evils before our great and good father; we hope<lb/>he
                            will remove them from amongst us; we shall<lb/>assure him that if he
                            does not, there will not be<lb/>many of his red children living long in
                            our country.<lb/>The Great Spirit, brothers, has made you see as
                            we<lb/>see; we hope, brothers, and expect, that if you have<lb/> any
                            influence with the great council of the United<lb/>States, that you will
                            make use of it in behalf of your<lb/>red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—The talks that you<lb/>delivered to us when we
                            were in council yesterday,<lb/>were certainly highly pleasing to myself,
                            as well as<lb/>to my brother chiefs; we rejoiced to hear you
                            speak<lb/>such words to us; but we all plainly saw, that there<lb/>was a
                            great difficulty in the way, that ought to be<lb/>removed, before your
                            good intentions towards us,<lb/>could be carried into effect: we agree
                            with you,<lb/>brothers, that this great evil amongst us,
                            spirituous<lb/>liquors, must first be removed; after this is done,
                            we<lb/>hope you will find an easy access to us, much easier<lb/>than you
                            can have at present.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—I hope that if we all<lb/>try to prevent the
                            introduction of spirituous liquors<lb/>in the country of your red
                            brethren, that the Great<lb/>Spirit will aid us in it, and that we shall
                            meet with<lb/>no difficulty in doing it; after this is done, we
                            hope<lb/>that the great services you have designed to do for<lb/>us, the
                            great things mentioned by you in our<lb/>council yesterday, may take
                            place, and have that<lb/> success you so much desire.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="SW_TE1834_138"/>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends—You have asked us our<lb/>opinion, on the subject
                            of the introduction of<lb/>spirituous liquors into our country. I have
                            now<lb/>given it to you. If I have given it to you in such<lb/>a manner
                            that you do not understand me, I would<lb/>wish you to say so; all that
                            I have said to you, I<lb/>wish to be made known to every body.</p>
                        <p>We have our enemies in our own country, as all<lb/>other persons have in
                            theirs; it is no unusual thing,<lb/> brothers, to hear some people among
                            us, (you will<lb/>perceive, brothers, that these are people that
                            are<lb/>interested in keeping us ignorant,) when they hear<lb/>talks
                            that have been delivered by our chiefs, to<lb/>people that are capable
                            of rendering us services, they<lb/>say to our people, <said
                                who="undetermined">do you not hear? your chiefs<lb/>have sold
                                you—your chiefs have sold your lands.</said><lb/>They put bad
                            stories in the mouths of our young<lb/>men. For this reason, brothers,
                            all that I have said I<lb/>wish to be made public; I wish every body to
                            know<lb/>it. I only mention this to you, brothers. If it
                            is<lb/>improper, I have no objection to your keeping it<lb/>amongst
                            yourselves; but if it could be made public, I<lb/>would wish it—I have
                            nothing further to say. (Sits<lb/>down.)</p>

                            appointed by that body to visit them, to exa-<lb/>mine their situation,
                            and endeavour to ascertain in<lb/>what manner so desirable a purpose
                            could be effected.<lb/>A part of that committee, after having obtained
                            the<lb/>approbation of the President of the United States,<lb/>proceeded
                            to perform the service assigned them- and<lb/>the result of their
                            inquiries and observations, as<lb/> reported to the <orgName key="bym"
                                >yearly meeting</orgName>, was, that the quantity<lb/>of spirituous
                            liquors, with which those people are<lb/>supplied by traders and
                            frontier settlers, must coun-<lb/>teract the effect of every measure,

                        <p>The truth of this is abundantly confirmed, by a <lb/><pb n="143" facs="SW_TE1834_140"/>speech

                            flow from love.</p>
                        <p>Sisters—We will also inform you, that we, and a<lb/>number of our Sisters

                        <p>Sisters—We find that these friends, who gave us<lb/>many good counsels,
                            are true men—so we believe, that<lb/>you are, also, our true <emph

                        <p>Sisters—We have religious meetings twice in<lb/>every week, to seek after

                            and<lb/>that we may be able to hold out to the end, where<lb/>we shall

                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> made the subject of imprisonment
                    for<lb/> debt, one of deep reflection. He did not believe that<lb/> a man could,
                    by any contract, pledge his liberty par-<lb/>tially; and it is conceded on all
                    sides, that no man<lb/>can make himself a slave, liberty being an
                    unalien-<lb/>able right. He saw that the gaols were crowded<lb/> with poor
                    debtors, sent to those awful places for<lb/>small sums, in general, where their
                    health and morals<lb/>were injured, and their spirits broken down. The<lb/>
                    philanthropist alone, whose feelings are enlisted in<lb/>the spirit of reform,
                    can come to any just calculation<lb/>of the number who, in former times,
                    suffered as poor<lb/>debtors. He knew that more than ten thousand<lb/>were
                    incarcerated in his own State, every year, for<lb/>sums that would not average
                    fifteen dollars each;<lb/>and he had sufficient information from many
                    other<lb/>States, to discover, that the evil existed among them<lb/>generally to
                    as great an extent, according to their<lb/> population. He frequently visited
                    the gaol in the<lb/>city of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, and
                    assisted the prisoners from<lb/>his own purse, and from monies belonging to
                    associ-<lb/>ations among the Friends. He did not live to see<lb/>imprisonment
                    for debt abolished in the State of <placeName key="newyo"
                        >New<lb/>York</placeName>; but he foresaw that the time would come,<lb/>
                    when that blot on the fame of our country would be<lb/>wiped away, not only in
                    this State, but in others.<lb/>He preserved in his diary, a letter, which he
                    believed<lb/>to have been written by the celebrated Indian, <persName
                        key="wbran1">Brandt</persName>,<lb/>who was educated at Dartmouth College.
                    It is so<lb/>full of just remarks, and is, in itself, so great a<lb/>curiosity,
                    that I thought it worthy of being pre-<lb/>served.</p>

                        <opener><salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>Your letter came safe to hand. To give you<lb/>entire satisfaction, I
                            must, I perceive, enter into the<lb/> discussion of a subject, on which
                            I have often thought.<lb/>My thoughts were my own, and, being so
                            different<lb/>from the ideas entertained among your people, I<lb/><pb
                                n="146" facs="SW_TE1834_143"/>should certainly have carried them with me to
                            the<lb/>grave, had I not received your obliging favour.</p>
                        <p>You ask me, then, whether, in my opinion, civili-<lb/>zation is
                            favourable to human happiness? In answer<lb/>to the question, it may be
                            answered, that there are<lb/>degrees of civilization, from cannibals to
                            the most<lb/> polite of European nations. The question is not,<lb/>then,
                            whether a degree of refinement is not condu-<lb/>cive to happiness, but
                            whether you, or the natives of<lb/>this land, have obtained this happy
                            medium. On<lb/>this subject we are, at present, I presume, of
                            very<lb/>different opinions. You will, however, allow me, in<lb/>some
                            respects, to have had the advantage of you in<lb/>forming my sentiments.
                            I was, Sir, born of Indian<lb/>parents, and lived, while a child, among
                            those whom<lb/>you are pleased to call savages. I was
                            afterwards<lb/>sent to live among the white people, and educated
                            at<lb/>one of your schools; since which period, I have been<lb/>honoured
                            much beyond my deserts, by an acquaint-<lb/>ance with a number of
                            principal characters, both in<lb/><placeName key="euro"
                                >Europe</placeName> and America. After all this experience, and<lb/>
                            after every exertion to divest myself of prejudice, I<lb/> am obliged to
                            give my opinion in favour of my own<lb/>people. I will now, as much as I
                            am able, collect<lb/>together, and set before you, some of the reasons
                            that<lb/>have influenced my judgment on the subject now<lb/>before us.
                            In the government you call civilized, the<lb/>happiness of the people is
                            constantly sacrificed to the<lb/>splendour of empire. Hence your codes
                            of criminal<lb/>and civil laws have had their origin; from
                            hence<lb/>your dungeons and prisons. I will not enlarge on an<lb/>idea,
                            so singular in civilized life, and, perhaps, dis-<lb/>agreeable to you;
                            I will only observe, that among<lb/>us we have <emph rend="italic"
                                >no</emph> prisons. We have no pompous parade<lb/> of courts; we
                            have no written laws, and yet judges<lb/> are as highly revered among us
                            as they are among <lb/>you, and their decisions as much regarded.
                            Property,<lb/> to say the least, is as well guarded, and crimes
                            are<lb/>as impartially punished. We have among us, no<lb/><pb n="147" facs="SW_TE1834_144"/>splendid villains above the control of our laws.<lb/> Daring
                            wickedness is here never suffered to triumph<lb/> over helpless
                            innocence; the estates of widows and<lb/>orphans are never devoured by
                            enterprising sharpers.<lb/>In a word, we have no robbery under the
                            colour of<lb/>law. No person among us desires any other reward<lb/>for
                            performing a brave and worthy action, but the<lb/>consciousness of
                            having served his Nation. Our wise<lb/>men are called Fathers—they truly
                            sustain that cha-<lb/>racter ; they are always accessible, I will not
                            say to<lb/>the meanest of our people, for we have none mean,<lb/>but
                            such as render themselves so by their vices.</p>
                        <p>The palaces and prisons among you form a most<lb/>dreadful contrast. Go
                            to the former places, and you<lb/>will see, perhaps, <emph rend="italic"
                                >a deformed piece of earth</emph>, assuming<lb/>airs that become
                            none but the Great Spirit above;<lb/> go to one of your prisons;—here
                            description utterly<lb/> fails. Kill them, if you please—kill them, too,
                            by<lb/> torture; but let the torture last no longer than a day.<lb/>
                            Those you call savages, relent; the most furious of<lb/>our tormentors
                            exhausts his rage in a few hours, and<lb/>despatches the unhappy victim
                            with a sudden stroke.<lb/> Perhaps, it is eligible that incorrigible
                            offenders should<lb/>sometimes be cut off—Let it be done in a way
                            that<lb/>is not degrading to human nature; let such unhap-<lb/>py men
                            have an opportunity, by the fortitude of their<lb/> death, of making an
                            atonement, in some measure,<lb/> for the crimes they have committed
                            during their lives.</p>
                        <p>But, for what are many of your prisoners con-<lb/>fined?—For
                            debt.—Astonishing! And will you ever<lb/>again call the Indian nation
                            cruel? Liberty, to a ra-<lb/>tional creature, as much exceeds property,
                            as the light<lb/> of the sun does that of the most twinkling star.<lb/>
                            But you put them on a level, to the everlasting dis-<lb/>grace of
                            civilization! I knew, while I lived among<lb/>the white people, many of
                            the most amiable contract<lb/>debts, and, I dare say, with the best
                            intentions. Both<lb/>parties, at the time of the contract, expect to
                            find<lb/>their advantage. The debtor, we will suppose, by a <lb/><pb
                                n="148" facs="SW_TE1834_145"/>train of unavoidable misfortunes, fails; here is
                            no<lb/>crime, nor even a fault; and yet, your laws put it in<lb/>the
                            power of the creditor to throw the debtor into<lb/>prison, and confine
                            him there for life!—a punishment<lb/> infinitely worse than death to a
                            brave man; and, I<lb/>seriously declare, I had rather die by the most
                            severe<lb/>tortures ever inflicted on this continent, than
                            languish<lb/>in one of your prisons for a single year. Great
                            Spirit<lb/>of the universe! And do you call yourselves Christ-<lb/>ians
                            ? does, then, the religion of Him whom you call<lb/>your Saviour,
                            inspire this spirit, and lead to these<lb/>practices?—Surely, no. It is
                            recorded of Him, that a<lb/> bruised reed he never broke. Cease, then,
                            to call<lb/>yourselves Christians, lest you publish to the
                            world<lb/>your hypocrisy. Cease, too, to call other nations<lb/>savage,
                            when you are tenfold more the children of<lb/>cruelty than they.</p>

                            an<lb/>undertaking that ranks among the most important<lb/>that has been

                        <p>The question, then, here naturally presents itself,<lb/>Who first
                            projected the system of inland navigation<lb/> from the Lakes to the

                        <p>The claimants to this honour are numerous and<lb/>respectable, and the
                            claims of each to a certain ex-<lb/>tent founded in justice. While the

                            benefactors<lb/>to this work may have his due share of praise,
                            pro-<lb/>portioned to the services he has rendered, it is pro-<lb/>posed
                            to divide them into various classes, designating<lb/>the nature,
                            character, and extent of those services.<lb/>I am fully sensible that
                            fame has given to some a<lb/> degree of reputation to which they are not

                            of<lb/>four great classes: in the first, may be enumerated,<lb/>those
                            foreseeing and predicting from the general<lb/>face of the country, the
                            union of the lakes, the creeks<lb/>and rivers of the west, by measures
                            calculated to<lb/>remove obstructions, improve the natural
                            navigation<lb/>then existing, and ultimately, by different outlets,
                            to<lb/>connect the same with the ocean. In this class, the<lb/>names of

                            most honourable mention in this<lb/>place. Thirdly, those who, in the
                            year <date when="1810">1810</date>, have<lb/>been chiefly instrumental
                            in effecting a direct inter-<lb/>nal communication between <geogName
                                key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName> and the<lb/>Atlantic. In this

                                key="jplat1">Jonas Platt</persName>,<lb/>and <persName key="dclin1"
                                >De Witt Clinton</persName>, stand conspicuous.
                            Fourthly,<lb/>another class of benefactors to this great work,
                            is<lb/>composed of numerous members of both Houses of<lb/>the
                            Legislature, who took a prominent station in<lb/> devising and
                            sustaining the measures necessary to<lb/>carry the same into effect; the
                            various canal com-<lb/>missioners, engineers, surveyors, and many
                            private<lb/>but public spirited citizens, in various parts of the
                            <lb/><pb n="151" facs="SW_TE1834_148"/>state, who have zealously given their personal
                            atten-<lb/>tions and services to this herculean undertaking, and<lb/>to
                            whom too much praise cannot be ascribed: so<lb/>great is the number
                            composing this class, that I am<lb/>compelled, at this time, to forbear
                            from their enume-<lb/>ration. The commissioners of the canal fund,

                            of the Lieutenant Governor, the Comptrol-<lb/>ler, the Attorney General,
                            the Surveyor General, the<lb/> Secretary and Treasurer, to whose special
                            care are<lb/>committed the regulations of the tolls, and other
                            cir-<lb/>cumstances relating to the government of the canal,<lb/>are
                            entitled to high approbation, for their intelligent<lb/>and faithful
                            discharge of the duties assigned them.<lb/>To all these different
                            classes of coadjutors, may be<lb/>ascribed a high and enviable measure
                            of applause.</p>
                        <p>The sagacity of some, in early perceiving the prac-<lb/>ticability, and

                            others, in unremitted exer-<lb/>tions to accomplish it; and the devotion
                            and sacri-<lb/>fices of all to its completion, will be remembered

                        <p>I was one (says he) of the first Directors of the<lb/>Western Inland Lock

                            until the com-<lb/>pany disposed of their property to the state, in

                            in forwarding the<lb/>views of the company, and in improving the
                            inter-<lb/>nal navigation of the state. Our funds were
                            not<lb/>sufficient to extend any improvement, further than<lb/>a few
                            miles west of <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName>. The company had
                            in<lb/> their service, <persName key="wwest1">William Weston</persName>,
                            an eminent engineer,<lb/>from <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>,

                                Schuyler</persName>, the President, I made several journies<lb/>to
                            the westward, in order to explore and examine<lb/>the country, as far as
                            Seneca Lake, in order to ascer-<lb/><pb n="152" facs="SW_TE1834_149"/>tain the practicability
                            of making improvements in<lb/>the navigation, as far as that place.
                            Being well<lb/>satisfied, from my own observation, of the
                            practica-<lb/>bility of making extensive improvements, by means
                            of<lb/>canals, &amp;c., through the western parts of the state,
                            and<lb/>considering the incalculable advantages that would<lb/>result
                            from the completion of such a magnificent<lb/>work, my mind was devoted
                            to its accomplishment.<lb/>As I was active in the prosecution of the
                            improve-<lb/>ments made by the Western Inland Lock
                            Navigation<lb/>Company, the geography and topography of the<lb/>western
                            parts of this state were very familiar to<lb/>my mind, and having been
                            very intimate with Mr.<lb/><persName key="wwest1">Weston</persName>,
                            when he was in this country, employed by<lb/>the company as Canal

                            from <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName> to<lb/><geogName key="cayug"

                            repeatedly with<lb/>him, whilst he was employed on the canals on

                            of the whole face of<lb/>the country fixed in my mind an ardent desire
                            to<lb/> extend a complete canal navigation, from <placeName key="rome"
                                >Rome</placeName> to<lb/><geogName key="sener">Seneca
                                river</geogName>. Occasionally, for many years, I urged<lb/>the
                            Western Canal Company to extend their im-<lb/>provements further west. A
                            vast sum of money had<lb/>been expended by them in improving the
                            navigation<lb/>of the <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogName>, which,
                            for many years, absorbed<lb/>the tolls, and prevented a dividend being
                            made<lb/>among the stockholders. Under these circumstances,<lb/>no
                            importunities of mine could prevail on the com-<lb/>pany to make
                            advances for further improvements.<lb/>In <date when="1810-03">March,
                                1810</date>, I was at <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and
                            it occurred to<lb/>me, that probably the Legislature might be
                            induced<lb/> to appoint commissioners, to examine and explore<lb/>the
                            western parts of the state, for the purpose of<lb/>ascertaining the
                            practicability of extending canal<lb/>navigation, and to estimate the
                            expense, and report<lb/> thereon. 1 was pertectly convinced, that if
                            commis-<lb/>sioners should be appointed, they would make a<lb/>very
                            favourable report. My friend, <persName key="jplat1">Jonas

                                >Senate</orgName>, and on the evening of the <date when="1810-03-12"
                                >12th<lb/>of March</date>, I called upon him, and suggested to him
                            a<lb/>plan, on which I had never consulted any person, of<lb/>proposing
                            to the Legislature, to appoint Commission-<lb/>ers, as before mentioned;
                            and I proposed to him, that<lb/>he should use his endeavours in the

                            replied, he very highly approved<lb/>of my proposition, and asked why
                            not make it the<lb/>duty of these commissioners to explore the
                            country,<lb/>as far as <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>, with
                            the view to ascertain the<lb/>practicability of making a complete canal,
                            from<lb/>thence to the Hudson? We immediately drafted a<lb/>joint
                            resolution, to be offered to both branches of the<lb/>Legislature, which
                            it was agreed he should present<lb/>to the <orgName key="nysen"
                                >Senate</orgName> next morning. We also thought it<lb/>would be
                            proper for us, then to fix on suitable names<lb/>to offer to the
                                <orgName key="nysen">Senate</orgName>, as Commissioners, and
                            we<lb/>agreed in the necessity of selecting persons equally<lb/>from the
                            two great political parties, which then divi-<lb/>ded the state. This we
                            did, according to the best<lb/>judgment we could form, and the following
                            gentle-<lb/>men were named, viz., <persName key="gmorr1">Gouverneur
                                Morris</persName>, <persName key="dclin1">De

                            concluded that I should meet <persName key="jplat1">Judge

                            Chamber, next morning, when I accord-<lb/>ingly attended, and we called
                            out <persName key="dclin1">De Witt Clinton</persName>,<lb/> and showed
                            him the resolution. He expressed his<lb/>hearty concurrence with our
                            plan, and as soon as<lb/>the <orgName key="nysen">Senate</orgName> was
                            formed, <persName key="jplat1">Judge Platt</persName> presented
                            the<lb/>resolution, which we had prepared the previous even-<lb/>ing. It
                            was seconded by <persName key="dclin1">Clinton</persName>, and passed
                            with-<lb/>out a dissenting voice. It passed the house in the<lb/>same
                            manner, within an hour after. In the summer<lb/> of <date when="1810"
                                >1810</date>, I accompanied the other Commissioners,
                            in<lb/>exploring the country, as far as <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogName>. In <date when="1811">1811</date>,<lb/>we made our
                            first report to the Legislature. Several<lb/> laws were enacted,
                            favourable to the prosecution of <lb/><pb n="154" facs="SW_TE1834_151"/>the project,
                            notwithstanding which, the measure<lb/>met with a serious and warm
                            opposition. The war<lb/>with <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>
                            seemed to put a stop to all farther<lb/>proceedings, and many persons
                            entertained serious<lb/>doubts of the practicability of the undertaking,
                            and<lb/>if practicable, that the resources of the state
                            were<lb/>incompetent to secure its completion. Besides
                            these<lb/>difficulties, the measure was opposed, with great<lb/>warmth,
                            on party grounds. Thus circumstanced,<lb/>after the war, the friends of
                            the project appeared to<lb/>be entirely discouraged, and to have given
                            up all<lb/> hopes of the Legislature being induced again to take<lb/>up
                            the subject, or adopt any measure to prosecute the<lb/>scheme. However,
                            I could not thus resign a favourite<lb/>project; and, it appeared to me,
                            that one more effort<lb/> should be made; and <persName key="jplat1"
                                >Judge Platt</persName>, being then (Au-<lb/>tumn of <date
                                when="1815">1815</date>) in the city, holding court, I wrote
                            a<lb/>note, inviting him to breakfast with me the next<lb/>morning. He
                            came, and I proposed to him, that if it<lb/>met his approbation, I would
                            undertake to get up<lb/>a public meeting, to be held at the City Hotel,
                            in<lb/>order to urge the propriety, and policy, of offering
                            a<lb/>memorial to the Legislature, pressing them to prose-<lb/>cute the
                            canal from <geogName key="lakee">Erie</geogName> to the <geogName

                            consented to<lb/>open the business to the meeting, if one could
                            be<lb/>obtained. I then called on <persName key="dclin1">De Witt

                            manner in<lb/>which it was written, it was evident he had a
                            com-<lb/>plete knowledge of the subject, and evinced the un-<lb/><pb
                                n="155" facs="SW_TE1834_152"/>common talents of the author. It was signed by<lb/>many
                            thousands in the city, and throughout the<lb/>state. With the

                            establishing the canal policy<lb/>on a firm basis, and producing the law

                        >Mr.<lb/>Eddy</persName> early saw the great utility of Savings

                    engaged in establishing savings banks in every city,<lb/>town, or village, where
                    they were required. The first<lb/>savings bank that was put into operation in
                    this<lb/> country was established at <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>, but almost<lb/>simultaneously another at

                    in the<lb/>city of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, but he met with
                    many difficulties<lb/>in the attempt. The objections raised were, one

                        when="1819">1819</date>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, with

                    This<lb/>bank has been in full operation ever since. <persName key="teddy1">Mr.

                    than fifty of these savings banks in<lb/>the United States, which have been of
                    an incalcula-<lb/>ble benefit to the poor. A bank not only saves
                    their<lb/>money, which might have been foolishly expended,<lb/>but it gives a

                    when he is pro-<lb/>vident enough to put his spare earnings into such
                    an<lb/>institution.</p>
                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was an active and zealous member
                    of<lb/>the New York Bible Society, and amongst the first to<lb/>lend his aid to
                    its establishment as early as <date when="1806">1806</date>, and<lb/>continued
                    his connexion with it until the time of his<lb/>death. This Society was founded
                    only two years<lb/>after the parent society in <placeName key="lond"
                        >London</placeName>. The origin of<lb/>the Society is a singular fact in
                    history. It is said,<lb/>that a Welsh divine, good as he of the same
                    country<lb/> described by Swift, whose cassock was out at elbows,<lb/>travelled
                    to <placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, and stated to some of the
                    reli-<lb/>gious societies the want of bibles in his flock, and the<lb/>great
                    scarcity of them throughout all <placeName key="wales">Wales</placeName>.
                    This<lb/>statement set the pious to making inquiries, and a <lb/><pb n="157" facs="SW_TE1834_154"/>great want of them was discovered in the army and<lb/>navy, and in fact almost
                    every where. In a short<lb/>time a society was formed, whose growth has
                    no<lb/>parallel in the history of nations. In less than thirty<lb/>years, the
                    branches of this noble society have caused<lb/>the Scriptures to be translated
                    and printed in more<lb/>than a hundred different languages, and spread
                    it<lb/>over the charitable globe. This book is now familiar<lb/>to the <orgName
                        key="eskimo">Esquimaux</orgName> of our northern regions, is spread<lb/>
                    throughout Asia, and is known in Africa. From five<lb/>thousand Bible Societies
                    that can be enumerated,<lb/>issued every year almost an incredible number
                    of<lb/>volumes, and therefore no one will perish for lack of<lb/>vision. These
                    bibles have not only spread the chris-<lb/>tian religion, but have been the
                    means of introducing<lb/>letters where they have been unknown before.
                    The<lb/>first talents of <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName> have been
                    engaged in transla-<lb/>ting them into various languages, previously but
                    little<lb/> known, even to the learned.</p>
                <p>With a sagacity that seems to foresee the results of<lb/>the experience of many
                    years, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was for<lb/>having the bible
                    go out without note or commentary,<lb/>that good sense and faith might have
                    their full influ-<lb/>ence. This is now, after all the experience had on<lb/>the
                    subject, thought to be the best course to pursue.</p>
                <p>The success of these societies have had salutary<lb/>influence among those who
                    have been engaged in<lb/>the cause. Many young men have read the Bible<lb/>with
                    care and attention, who never would have done<lb/>it, if the societies of which
                    they were members had<lb/>not had before them subjects of discussion,

                    praiseworthy to obtain,<lb/>if rightly set before them. Another beneficial
                    effect<lb/>of the Bible, and other societies, of a charitable and<lb/>religious
                    kind, is, that they draw young men from<lb/>gay habits, and give them stability
                    and gravity in<lb/>early life. In truth, it may be set down as an axiom,<lb/><pb
                        n="158" facs="SW_TE1834_155"/>that when institutions of learning and benevolence<lb/>increase,

                        <p>The formation of the <orgName key="ambib">American Bible
                                Society</orgName>, has<lb/>often disposed my mind, to reflect on the
                            past and<lb/>present state of society in the world. In the course<lb/>of
                            such reflections, I am naturally led to admire the<lb/>goodness and love
                            of the divine author of our exist-<lb/>ence, in preparing, in his own
                            way, the improvement<lb/>and melioration of mankind. His wisdom is
                            dis-<lb/>played, in proportioning the degree of light to our<lb/>weak
                            and feeble state. The splendour of the sun<lb/>is preceded by the dawn
                            of day—so it is with respect<lb/>to the many essential and important
                            truths, with<lb/>which the minds of men have been enlightened
                            at<lb/>different periods of the world. Thus, formerly, an<lb/>eye for an
                            eye, a tooth for a tooth, or the life of an<lb/> offender as an
                            expiation for his crime, were the rude<lb/>summary laws, which <emph
                                rend="italic">then</emph> seemed to be the perfec-<lb/>tion of
                            justice. But the mild principles of the Chris-<lb/>tian religion, held
                            out an easy and simple lesson for<lb/>the instruction of men, and taught
                                them—<quote type="biblical">Whatso-<lb/>ever ye would that men
                                should do to you, do you<lb/>even so to them</quote>—<quote
                                type="biblical">love your enemies—do good<lb/>unto them that
                                despitefully use you.</quote>—It is certain,<lb/>that even many of
                            those, who were not baptized into<lb/>the spirit of our holy religion,
                            were considerably in-<lb/>fluenced by these solemn and self-evident
                            truths.</p>
                        <p>It requires but a very slight acquaintance either<lb/>with the principles
                            of human nature, or the history<lb/>of civil society, to be convinced,
                            that until the human<lb/>mind became capable of perceiving the enormity
                            of<lb/> tolerating slavery, and the cruel injustice of holding<lb/>a
                            portion of human beings in a state of abject bond-<lb/>age, we should
                            never have been able to discover<lb/>the necessity of those prudent,
                            humane, and salutary<lb/> regulations, which have taken the place of
                            sangui-<lb/><pb n="159" facs="SW_TE1834_156"/>nary penal laws.—Thus, also, has christian
                            sym-<lb/>pathy been gradually developed, and brought into<lb/>action
                            that spirit of philanthropy, which desires to<lb/>promote the welfare of
                                <emph rend="italic">every</emph> part of the human<lb/>family. Hence
                            we have been led into the exercise<lb/>of those benign affections, which
                            have pointed out to<lb/>us the reasonableness and propriety of pursuing
                            a<lb/> course of mild and humane treatment, towards
                            those<lb/>unfortunate persons who are afflicted with a dimi-<lb/>nution
                            or aberration of intellect.</p>
                        <p>At this auspicious period let us pause—a scene of<lb/>activity presents
                            itself, fraught with an increase of<lb/>knowledge, enlargement of mind,
                            and new powers<lb/>of rational enjoyment.—A new impulse has
                            been<lb/>given to the Christian family, and its influence ex-<lb/>tends

                <p>From observations made upon the state of society<lb/>in the city of <placeName
                        key="nycit">New-York</placeName>, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>
                    came to the con-<lb/>clusion, that one great cause of crime was
                    pauperism,<lb/>which, in most instances in this country, arose
                    from<lb/>ignorance in the poorer classes of the people; and, that<lb/><pb
                        n="161" facs="SW_TE1834_158"/>those who would do the best for the community, must<lb/>strike at
                    the root of this evil, by teaching the children<lb/>of the poor to read and
                    write, that they might be<lb/>able to find useful employment, or learn some
                    trade<lb/>to enable them to earn a competent subsistence.<lb/>As this subject
                    was deeply impressed on his mind,<lb/>he frequently corresponded with his friend
                        <persName key="pcolq1">Patrick<lb/>Colquhoun</persName>, of <placeName
                        key="westm1">Westminster</placeName>, who entertained similar<lb/>views, and
                    he had, of course, the light of that<lb/>powerful mind to assist him. <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was tho-<lb/>roughly convinced of the
                    efficacy of the system of<lb/>general instruction in operation in the Eastern
                    States;<lb/>but, he thought, that it would be quite impossible to<lb/>bring the
                    Legislature of <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName> to pass a law
                    for<lb/>such a school system, at that time;—such a one<lb/>must grow up
                    radically with a people—it cannot<lb/>easily be done, after the population is
                    numerous, and<lb/> wealth has greatly increased. The rich man will<lb/>not
                    consent that he should be taxed, according to his<lb/>property, to maintain
                    schools, and then see that<lb/>money distributed in districts, according to the
                    num-<lb/>ber of children under a certain age, such as usually<lb/>attend an
                    instructor the whole or a portion of a<lb/>year.</p>
                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> had frequently conversed with
                    his<lb/>friends, <persName key="jmurr1">John Murray, jun.</persName> and
                        <persName key="mfran1">Matthew Franklin</persName>, on<lb/>the subject of
                    schools; and, in <date when="1805-02">February, 1805</date>, they<lb/>proposed
                    to him, to form an association of Friends,<lb/>to establish a free school, for
                    the benefit of poor child-<lb/>ren, not members of their religious society. To
                        this<lb/><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> objected, as he thought
                    it would be impos-<lb/>sible to raise funds sufficient to support a school,<lb/>
                    except on a small scale, if it was confined to Friends<lb/>alone. He then
                    proposed to call to his aid a num-<lb/>ber of respectable citizens, of different
                    religious de-<lb/>nominations. The meeting was called; it was gene-<lb/>rally
                    attended by the most active classes in the city,<lb/>and a committee was
                    appointed to raise funds by<lb/> subscription; and, also, to apply to the
                    Legislature<lb/><pb n="162" facs="SW_TE1834_159"/>for assistance. An act of incorporation, under
                    the<lb/>name of the <orgName key="nyfss">Society for establishing a Free
                        School</orgName>,<lb/>in the city of <placeName key="nycit"
                        >New-York</placeName>, for the education of such<lb/>poor children as do not
                    belong to, or are not provided<lb/>for by, any religious society, was obtained.
                    The school<lb/>was soon opened, and twelve scholars admitted. From<lb/>this
                    exertion, grew the splendid system of education<lb/>now in operation in the
                    state of <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>. There had<lb/>been some
                    legislative provisions previously enacted,<lb/>but the act had expired, without
                    producing any<lb/>beneficial effects. At the commencement of the sys-<lb/>tem,
                    the instruction was confined to the poor, who<lb/>were not otherwise provided
                    for; at length it extend-<lb/>ed to all classes, and the reluctance that was
                    felt, by<lb/>those in good circumstances, to sending their child-<lb/>ren to
                    these common schools, is every day diminish-<lb/>ing, and will soon cease
                    altogether. The first men<lb/>of New England were educated in their
                    common<lb/>schools.* <note resp="editor" rend="asterisk"> * In New England, although every man
                        who pays a tax, has a vote not<lb/>only in general elections, but, also, in
                        town offices, and in raising money<lb/> and expending it; yet, the wealthy
                        and well-to-do, have to take care of<lb/>the poor; for, in many instances,
                        they have been opposed to raising money<lb/>for their common schools. In a
                        town in <placeName key="mass">Massachusetts</placeName>, of no
                        inconsidera-<lb/>ble size, where education is under the best of regulations,
                        a proposition was<lb/>made, in town-meeting, to establish another school. A
                        poor man who often<lb/>admired his own eloquence in these primary
                        assemblies, opposed the measure<lb/>on the ground of oppressive taxation and
                        spoke so strongly that many began<lb/>to doubt the expediency of
                        establishing another school at that time. A friend<lb/> to the proposition
                        for another school followed the orator. He had prepared<lb/> to meet this
                        influence. He showed, in the first place, that the speaker, who<lb/> alone
                        opposed the measure, had been the father of ten sons, who were all edu-<lb/>
                        cated at the common schools in town, and that these sons had, on an
                        ave-<lb/>rage, been at school seven years each. The gentlemen who argued in
                        favour<lb/>of the additional school, next exhibited the school tax, from the
                        time the oppo-<lb/>ser first paid a tax, to that year, and showed that his
                        proportion of the whole<lb/>sum, for the seven years schooling of his boys,
                        had been 39 cents only.<lb/> They were bright boys, and often obtained
                        prizes of books. Such is preju-<lb/>dice without calculation. EDITOR.

                <p>Though not the first among the states of the con-<lb/>federacy to introduce the
                    system of universal educa-<lb/>tion, <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>
                    may, with some truth, be said to<lb/>have surpassed all the other states, in the
                    liberality,<lb/>as well as the sound policy, of her provisions for
                    its<lb/>maintenance. She has happily taken the due means<lb/>between relying
                    wholly upon taxation on the one<lb/>hand, and upon accumulated funds on the
                    other, for<lb/>the support of schools throughout her community.<lb/>She has
                    avoided the error of applying all her legis-<lb/>lation to a single class of
                    institutions; thus showing<lb/>a spirit above the petty jealousy that would
                    annihi-<lb/>late the higher, and a sense and patriotism that im-<lb/>peratively
                    forbade her to neglect the lower semina-<lb/>ries of learning. We do not find
                    colleges and uni-<lb/>versities multiplied till one actually devours
                    another,<lb/>while the mass of the community is without even<lb/>the ordinary
                    rudiments of knowledge; nor do we<lb/>perceive, on the contrary, the avenues to
                    classical at-<lb/>tainments so hedged about by the expensiveness,
                    the<lb/>useless requisitions, and the forbidding ceremonials<lb/>which might
                    appal the youth, whose <emph rend="italic">treasures were<lb/> only of the
                        mind</emph>, from attempting to gain the station<lb/>in society, for which
                    his natural endowments had<lb/>qualified him.</p>
                <p>There does not appear any ostentatious display<lb/>of extravagance in her
                    expenditures for education,—<lb/>nor any of that niggardly parsimony which
                    would<lb/>compel the people to buy a cheap commodity of<lb/> learning, sure, at
                    the same time, that it must be a<lb/><emph rend="italic">poor</emph> one.</p>
                <p>She has not hesitated, while prosecuting the most<lb/>magnificent schemes for
                    improving the value of her<lb/>physical resources, to devise and execute plans
                    far<lb/>more magnificent for the development of her intel-<lb/>lectual
                    treasures. It has not been the spirit of her<lb/><pb n="164" facs="SW_TE1834_161"/>measures to
                    consign a whole generation <emph rend="italic">now existing</emph><lb/>to
                    brutish ignorance, in order that the <emph rend="italic">next</emph>
                    might<lb/>riot in its earnings, and sink in the same manner<lb/>into oblivion,
                    without having been provided with<lb/>means of any rational enlargement of the
                    most<lb/> ennobling faculties. She has not been terrified by<lb/>the fear that
                    the coming age, which is to be the heir<lb/>of her noble heritage of knowledge,
                    freedom, and<lb/>moral power, should be compelled to pay out of its<lb/>immense
                    resources, a few of the millions by which<lb/>that heritage was originally
                    obtained. She has per-<lb/>ceived it to be sound policy to incur a <emph
                        rend="italic">debt</emph>, when the<lb/>transaction is sure to multiply a
                    hundred fold the<lb/>power of repaying it. The system of internal
                    im-<lb/>provements, instead of absorbing and annihilating<lb/>those very
                    resources which are wanted to sustain<lb/>public spirit and intelligence, by
                    means of education,<lb/>is, in <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>, made
                    to minister directly and effec-<lb/>tually to that object, and thus to react in
                    producing<lb/>again the foresight and discernment which were<lb/>alone requisite
                    to, understand the utility of those<lb/>improvements, even before they had an
                    existence.</p>
                <p><emph rend="italic">Origin of the System.</emph> The foundation of a sys-<lb/>tem
                    of common schools was laid in this state nearly<lb/>forty years ago. The first
                    act to that effect was<lb/>passed <date when="1795-04-09">April 9, 1795</date>,
                    appropriating out of the annual<lb/>revenues of the state, twenty thousand
                    pounds annu-<lb/>ally, for five years, for the purpose of encouraging<lb/>and
                    maintaining schools in the several cities and<lb/>towns in the state. The
                    several counties were re-<lb/>quired to raise a sum equal to one half of that
                    appro-<lb/>priated to each by the state. At the expiration of<lb/>this law, in
                        <date when="1800">1800</date>, the legislature refused to renew it;<lb/>but,
                    in <date when="1805">1805</date>, impelled, probably, by a sense of the<lb/>
                    deprivation under which the state laboured, in being<lb/>again thrown back upon
                    voluntary, iridividual, or<lb/>local efforts, the legislature passed an act,
                    providing<lb/>that the nett proceeds of five hundred thousand acres<lb/>of
                    vacant and unappropriated public lands should<lb/><pb n="165" facs="SW_TE1834_162"/>be applied to
                    form a permanent fund for the support<lb/>of common schools. In the same year,
                    three thou-<lb/>sand shares of bank stock were ordered to be sub-<lb/>scribed by
                    the state, and to belong to the school<lb/>fund. No part of this fund was to be
                    applied to its<lb/> ultimate object, until the interest should amount
                    to<lb/>fifty thousand dollars annually.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1811">1811</date>, measures were taken to organize and
                    es-<lb/>tablish, in active force, a system of schools; such a<lb/>system was
                        <emph rend="italic">reported</emph> in <date when="1812">1812</date>, and
                    the first distribu-<lb/>tion of money under the provisions of <date when="1805"
                        >1805</date>, and in<lb/>accordance with this system, were made in the year<lb/>
                    <date when="1816">1816</date>. Besides the avails of the lands, and of
                    the<lb/>bank stock, above mentioned, the legislature enacted,<lb/>in <date
                        when="1819">1819</date>, that one half the amount to be received
                        from<lb/><emph rend="italic">quit rents</emph>; the <emph rend="italic"
                        >loans</emph> of <date when="1790">1790</date>, and of <date when="1808"
                        >1808</date>; the <emph rend="italic">shares</emph><lb/>of the capital stock
                    of the Merchant's Bank, held by<lb/>the state; the nett proceeds of <emph
                        rend="italic">lands escheating</emph> to<lb/>the state, in the military
                    tract; and the nett proceeds<lb/>of the <emph rend="italic">fees</emph> of the
                    clerks of the supreme court, should<lb/>all be assigned to this fund. In <date
                        when="1824">1824</date>, a reservation<lb/>in certain grants for lotteries,
                    amounting to forty<lb/>thousand dollars, was added to the fund. In <date
                        when="1826">1826</date>,<lb/>it was enacted, that one hundred thousand
                    dollars<lb/>should be annually distributed, by the state, for the<lb/>support of
                    common schools; but, as the fund then<lb/>produced but eighty-five thousand
                    dollars, the remain-<lb/>ing fifteen thousand dollars were paid trom the
                    gene-<lb/>ral funds of the state. In <date when="1827">1827</date>, further
                    appropria-<lb/>tions, to make up the full amount of one hundred<lb/>thousand
                    dollars, were made from the state loans of<lb/><date when="1786">1786</date>,
                    and from the bank stock still held by the state.<lb/>These two items amounted to
                    one hundred and<lb/>thirty-three thousand six hundred and sixteen dollars.</p>
                <p>In the same year, the credit of the state was<lb/>pledged, in certificates of
                    stock, to a canal company,<lb/>(the Hudson and Delaware,) which certificates
                    were<lb/>to be sold, and the premiums obtained added to the<lb/>school fund;
                    this transaction produced fifty thousand<lb/><pb n="166" facs="SW_TE1834_163"/>dollars; and, finally,
                    a large number of town lots, at<lb/><placeName key="osweg2">Oswego</placeName>,
                    amounting to ninety-one thousand three<lb/>hundred and forty-nine dollars, were
                    sold in the<lb/>same year, and the proceeds, together with all the<lb/>sums
                    obtained from the above-mentioned sources,<lb/>swelled the productive capital at
                    the beginning of<lb/><date when="1828">1828</date>, to one million six hundred
                    and thirty thousand<lb/>eight hundred and ninety-five dollars. The <emph
                        rend="italic">constitu<lb/>tion of the state</emph> provides, that the
                    proceeds of all<lb/>lands which shall be hereafter sold, or disposed
                    of,<lb/>shall belong to the fund for the support of common<lb/>schools. In <date
                        when="1830">1830</date>, these lands consisted of eight hun-<lb/>dred and
                    sixty-nine thousand one hundred and<lb/>seventy-eight acres, estimated at half a
                    million of<lb/>dollars, which, added to the productive capital,<lb/>makes two
                    millions one hundred and thirty thousand<lb/>eight hundred and twenty-five
                    dollars. Besides the<lb/>general fund of the state, there are likewise
                    several<lb/>local funds arising out of certain reserved lands in<lb/>the
                    respective counties. More than eighty towns are<lb/>stated to participate in the
                    benefit of these funds,<lb/>amounting to the sum of about seventeen
                    thousand<lb/>dollars annually.</p>
                <p><emph rend="italic">Progress of the System.</emph> The first distribution
                    of<lb/>public moneys, out of the fund, was made, as we<lb/>have said, in <date
                        when="1816">1816</date>, and not till then, can the system<lb/>be said to
                    have gone into actual operation. An esti-<lb/>mate may be formed of the
                    influence of this system<lb/>by comparing the state of things before the
                    funds<lb/> became available, with that which has existed since.<lb/>In sixteen
                    counties in which the state of schools was<lb/>reported in <date when="1798"
                        >1798</date>, the number of schools was then one<lb/>thousand three hundred
                    and fifty-two, and of scholars<lb/>fifty-nine thousand six hundred and sixty. In
                        the<lb/><emph rend="italic">same counties</emph>, in <date when="1828"
                        >1828</date>, the number of school districts<lb/>established was two
                    thousand five hundred and<lb/>eighty-six, and of scholars attending them, one
                    hun-<lb/>dred and forty-two thousand three hundred and<lb/>seventy-two. Even
                    this comparison falls far short<lb/><pb n="167" facs="SW_TE1834_164"/>of exhibiting the actual
                    increase of schools, and of<lb/> pupils throughout the state; for, in <date
                        when="1798">1798</date>, there were<lb/>in all but twenty-three counties
                    organized, and<lb/>therefore only seven which did not report. But, in<lb/><date
                        when="1828">1828</date>, there were fifty-five counties, divided into
                    seven<lb/> hundred and forty-two towns and wards, and eight<lb/>thousand two
                    hundred and ninety-eight school dis-<lb/>tricts, containing four hundred and
                    forty-one thou-<lb/>sand eight hundred and fifty-six children. It is
                    true,<lb/>there are other causes besides the inherent efficacy of<lb/>the
                    system, which should be regarded in accounting<lb/>for the rapid increase of
                    schools and pupils. The<lb/>new counties formed subsequently to <date
                        when="1798">1798</date>, were set-<lb/>tled chiefly by emigrants from
                    New-England, who<lb/>brought with them, as an essential part of
                    their<lb/>existence, a habit of regarding <emph rend="italic">universal
                        education in<lb/>common public schools</emph>, as among the primary
                    objects<lb/> for which <emph rend="italic">laws</emph> are to be enacted. And
                    when the<lb/>system had been once established, it is easy to see<lb/>that its
                    operation upon the minds of new companies<lb/>of such emigrants, must be to
                    determine them to select<lb/>the state which had made this munificent
                    provision<lb/>for that, which they consider as one of the first wants<lb/>of
                    their nature, to be their permanent abode, in pre-<lb/>ference to another, where
                    no such allurement was<lb/>held out, whatever might otherwise be the
                    physical<lb/>superiority of the latter. Thus we see, that the sys-<lb/>tem of
                    common schools has reacted, in turn, in favour<lb/>of population, and
                    consequently in favour of wealth<lb/>and of power. physical, moral, and
                    political. </p>

                <p>In <date when="1832">1832</date>, the number of academies had risen

                    observe, that a liberal spirit has<lb/>been manifested in furnishing to these
                    institutions<lb/><pb n="171" facs="SW_TE1834_168"/> various means and implements for cultivating
                    the<lb/> natural sciences, and that some of them have already<lb/>become useful
                    to science, by their application of these<lb/>means. We may refer particularly
                    to the numerous<lb/> sets of meteorological observations occasionally
                    pub-<lb/>lished by the <q>Regents,</q> and which are all made at<lb/>the

                <p>As the latter are generally taught but a part of<lb/>the year, that is, on an

                    New-York Corresponding<lb/>Association for the Promotion of Internal

                        >De<lb/>Witt Clinton</persName> was chosen President, and
                        Doctor<lb/><persName key="smitc1">Samuel L. Mitchell</persName>, and the

                    the committee of correspondence and publication.<lb/>The association exerted
                    themselves for several years<lb/>with great assiduity, and the labours of the
                    chairman<lb/>were very arduous, but promptly discharged. Who<lb/>has now the

                    valuable information<lb/>must have been collected by such indefatigable
                    and<lb/>intellectual men as formed that association; and it is<lb/>well known,
                    that their publications were numerous.</p>
                <p>On the great subject of slavery, which is now agi-<lb/>tating the world,
                        <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> took an early part. He<lb/>saw
                    millions suffering in bondage, and willed them<lb/>to be free; but this was not
                    enough; he knew that<lb/>means must be applied to ends, and that it was
                    in<lb/>vain to deplore the condition of the Africans without<lb/>strenuous
                    exertions. He was an active member of<lb/>the Abolition and Manumission
                    Societies, and corres-<lb/>ponded with the philanthropists of <placeName
                        key="euro">Europe</placeName> on the<lb/>subject, as well as with the
                    leaders in the cause of<lb/>freedom in <placeName key="haiti">Hayti</placeName>.
                    He saw, as every wise man does,<lb/>that the evil was one that increased in
                    magnitude<lb/>every day, and as time advanced, became more diffi-<lb/>cult to
                    eradicate. It was the voice of such philan-<lb/>thropists, that assisted the
                    politicians in fixing the<lb/>boundaries of the slave-trade, which was the
                    first<lb/>step in the march of this charity; and which, if judi-<lb/>ciously
                    followed up, will, in the end, drive the evil from<lb/>this country and the West
                    Indies, and perhaps from <lb/><pb n="173" facs="SW_TE1834_170"/> the world. The curse is becoming
                    more intolerable<lb/>to the man who is considered the wealthy owner
                    of<lb/>slaves, than even the imagination of the opposers of<lb/>slavery could
                    have pictured.</p>
                <p>The great work of emancipation and colonization<lb/>is going on with zeal and
                    success. Beside the Parent<lb/>Colonization Society, fifteen State Colonization
                    Socie-<lb/>ties have been formed, and more than two hundred<lb/>and fifty
                    auxiliaries established. New associations<lb/>are every day forming, to raise
                    the condition of the<lb/>coloured free population; and these societies
                    greatly<lb/>assist each other. These associations, formed for the<lb/>purpose of
                    enlightening and benefiting the world,<lb/>are the great moral engines by which

                        <p>As it may be proper for the Canal Company to<lb/>make an application to
                            the legislature this winter, I<lb/>think it would be right to be
                            prepared early. We <lb/><pb n="174" facs="SW_TE1834_171"/>are in debt to the State
                                15,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. Many reasons may<lb/>be urged to
                            induce the legislature to take so many of<lb/>the unsubscribed shares,
                            as amount to that sum;<lb/>they certainly would be more ready to do
                            this, than<lb/> to relinquish a claim for the interest for four or
                            five<lb/>years, as we proposed last winter. Whilst we are<lb/>obliged to
                            pay 900<emph rend="italic">l</emph>., per year, interest on the
                            above<lb/> debt out of the tolls, we will not be able to divide<lb/>to
                            the stockholders more than two per cent, as a<lb/>dividend. Perhaps some
                            other way may occur to<lb/>thee to propose, for them to afford us
                            pecuniary aid.</p>
                        <p>The claims of the people at <geogName key="stillr">Still-Water</geogName>

                            the stockhold-<lb/>ers refuse to pay, the comptroller would pay for
                            the<lb/> shares held by the state, the claimants might then be<lb/>paid;
                            the corporation dissolved, and the whole stock<lb/>of the Northern
                            Company belong only to the state.<lb/>I take the liberty of sending
                            those hints, in hopes thou<lb/>wilt be so good as to improve them, and
                            if it meets<lb/>thy approbation, to draw a petition to the
                            legislature<lb/>on behalf of the Western Company, containing

                            least once every month, to examine<lb/>into the conduct of the keeper,
                            who should have rules<lb/>made by the inspectors, for his government.
                            The<lb/>rooms should, by law, be directed to be white washed<lb/>twice
                            every year, and no other than a low diet be allow-<lb/>ed, and strictly
                            to prohibit any spirituous liquors. The<lb/> inspectors might be
                            appointed by the county court,<lb/>or supervisors, or by council of
                            appointment. Many<lb/>of the jails at present are taverns; this should
                            be<lb/>by law prevented. An allowance to the keeper<lb/>sufficient to
                            procure a man of fair character should<lb/>be paid out of the public
                            treasury. As our laws now<lb/>are, the keeper, as he must have charge of
                            the debtors,<lb/>must be appointed by the sheriff.</p>
                        <p>If what I have suggested meets thy approbation,<lb/>I know thou wilt
                            considerably improve my plan; if<lb/> so, and thou hast leisure to draw
                            a bill, it will much<lb/>oblige me to be favoured with a copy.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept my best wishes for thy health,<lb/>and believe me

                            <salute>DEAR FRIEND.</salute></opener>
                        <p>During the inclemency of the weather this morn-<lb/>ing, my mind has been
                            turned towards several absent<lb/>Friends, and I determined to let them
                            know it; per-<lb/>haps this may be the only sentiment worth
                            commu-<lb/>nicating to thee; if it so turn out, thou mayest
                            credit<lb/>me accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The peace which has been lately concluded between<lb/>Great Britain and
                            this country, whilst it is a subject<lb/>of general greeting and
                            rejoicing, will, I hope, impress <lb/><pb n="176" facs="SW_TE1834_173"/> our minds with
                            thankfulness to him who is the<lb/> author of every good and perfect
                            gift; and dispose<lb/>us in future to harmonize more with each
                            other.<lb/>That political trick and juggle, by which many
                            have<lb/>contrived to direct the minds of the innocent and<lb/> unwary,
                            brought us to a precipice, to which it is even<lb/>now difficult to look
                            back without shuddering. If<lb/>honesty of intention, and integrity of
                            conduct, were<lb/>but the rule and practice of those appointed to
                            direct<lb/>the affairs of the nation, I think, with the warning<lb/>we
                            have had, we might long remain a separate and<lb/>peaceful people; but
                            whether we are or shall soon<lb/>become fit to receive, and capable of
                            enjoying, such<lb/>blessings, is known only to him whose ways,
                            though<lb/>past finding out, must be infinitely great and good,<lb/>and
                            must have for their object the happiness of his<lb/>creature, man.</p>
                        <p>Not only have I contemplated the subject, as to its<lb/>general effect;
                            but also as to its effect on some of my<lb/>personal friends. I have
                            anticipated the pleasure of<lb/>hearing that it will effectually relieve
                            those in <placeName key="newyo">New<lb/>York</placeName>, who have been
                            threatened with pecuniary loss<lb/>and embarrassment, by reason of the
                            failure of Min-<lb/>turn and Champlin, and that they themselves
                            will<lb/>be restored to a state of as much ease and affluence<lb/>as
                            will do them good. I should be made glad by<lb/>hearing from thee, to
                            this effect.</p>
                        <p>Another anticipation I have indulged in. That<lb/>thyself and wife will
                            give us your company at the<lb/>time of the next <orgName key="nym"
                                >Yearly Meeting</orgName>. Nor do I mean to<lb/>confine it to you
                            only, but such other of the family<lb/>as may accompany you.</p>
                        <p>Present my Sally's love to <persName key="heddy1">Hannah</persName> and
                            the children,<lb/>and accept the assurance of my esteem.</p>

                                are enforced; and, especially, to ascertain the<lb/>influence
                                thereof, on the subjects of such treatment,<lb/>as well as their
                                effect on the general condition of<lb/>society.</said></p>
                        <p>Since the establishment of this institution, many<lb/>of its zealous and
                            benevolent founders have gone<lb/>down to the grave. Some few, however,
                            continue<lb/> actively interested in its concerns; who were
                            early<lb/>engaged in those humane exertions, which, regardless<lb/>of
                            the influence of prejudice, and the example of<lb/>ages, aimed at the
                            accomplishment of a reformation<lb/>in the penal jurisprudence of
                                <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>. With<lb/>these are
                            now united others, who, from a conviction<lb/>of the importance and
                            utility of those labours, as well<lb/>as knowledge of the success of the
                            experiments<lb/> which flowed from them, have been induced to
                            give<lb/>their assistance to the same philanthropic cause.</p>
                        <p>To both these descriptions of our members it hath<lb/>become an
                            interesting inquiry, what have been the<lb/>effects produced in your
                            state by the adoption of a<lb/>meliorated code of criminal laws?
                            Whether, allowing<lb/>for the increase of population, since their
                            creation, crimes<lb/>have diminished in their number, or degree of
                            enor-<lb/>mity? Whether individuals, who, by their errors,<lb/>have
                            unhappily been the subjects of your peniten-<lb/>tiary system, are,
                            since its wholesome correction,<lb/>restored to usefulness in the
                            community? and, gene-<lb/>rally, whether the moral condition of society
                            has<lb/>been improved, and the security of its members pro-<lb/>moted,
                            by the abolition of punishments, which were<lb/>not less vindictive and
                            cruel, than was the employ-<lb/><pb n="178" facs="SW_TE1834_175"/>ment of them degrading to
                            the character of our spe-<lb/>cies?</p>
                        <p>It is not only for our own satisfaction, that we are<lb/>desirous of
                            obtaining whatever information you can<lb/>furnish in relation to these
                            interesting subjects, but<lb/>because we believe the combined experience
                            of all<lb/>those who have been engaged in this great object of<lb/>state
                            polity, cannot fail to advance its value in the<lb/> estimation of
                            others, and thereby subserve, at once,<lb/>the purposes of justice, and
                            the cause of humanity.</p>
                        <p>We believe that, in our own country, the number<lb/>of its friends is
                            gradually multiplying; and it is with<lb/> peculiar satisfaction, we
                            have heard of the exertions<lb/>which some benevolent individuals, in
                            their private<lb/>capacity, as well as enlightened statesmen, in
                            their<lb/>public character, are employing in Great Britain,
                            to<lb/>render the laws of that kingdom less sanguinary.—<lb/>These
                            advocates of reformation have had the candour<lb/>to acknowledge, that
                            they were encouraged to com-<lb/>mence the laudable work, from the
                            success which<lb/> had followed our experiments; and hence we see
                            the<lb/>importance of embodying all the evidence which can<lb/>be
                            collected, to support, in <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>,
                            this effort of<lb/>mercy, and of diffusing these beneficent

                            amelioration of the penal laws.</p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="SW_TE1834_176"/>
                        <p>Some years ago, I was led to reflect on the state of<lb/>the criminal
                            code in this state, and warmly impressed<lb/>with the belief, that all
                            laws not founded on the<lb/>principles of truth and justice, the common
                            feelings<lb/>of humanity, and the rights of mankind, should
                            be<lb/>repealed; I took a very decided and active part in
                            en-<lb/>deavouring to obtain a repeal of our former system,
                            and<lb/>establishing one more consistent with the pure prin-<lb/>ciples
                            of Christianity. In <date when="1796">1796</date>, our laws were
                            altered,<lb/>a state prison was directed to be built, and I was<lb/>
                            appointed one of the board of inspectors. My zeal<lb/>for promoting a
                            plan, which I conceived would tend<lb/>to soften the dispositions of
                            those concerned in govern-<lb/>ment, and thereby enlighten and prepare
                            their minds<lb/> for still more improving the condition and state
                            of<lb/>mankind, induced me to leave extensive mercantile<lb/>pursuits,
                            and reside near the prison, about two miles<lb/>from the city, in order
                            that I might strictly attend to<lb/> its concerns. To reduce such a
                            description of men<lb/>to a regular course of labour, decent behaviour,
                            and<lb/>cleanliness, was a task that required unremitting<lb/>attention,
                            and on the success of the scheme, depended<lb/> whether society should
                            revive the former, or continue<lb/>the new system. I was exceedingly
                            anxious that<lb/>our prison should furnish a model for other states,
                            <lb/>and have therefore attended, when in health, almost<lb/>daily, to
                            superintend its concerns, and every winter<lb/>for five years past,
                            visited <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, in order to promote
                            <lb/>the passing of such laws or alterations of former<lb/>ones, as were
                            deemed necessary, to perfect the pre-<lb/>sent code. I have lately
                            published an account<lb/>of the prison, for the information of the
                            public;<lb/>and with a view to excite other states to follow
                            our<lb/>example. I take the liberty now, to present thee<lb/>with one of
                            those publications, which will give full<lb/>information of the
                            management, economy, &amp;c. of the<lb/>prison.</p>
                        <p>I understand there are some prisons in <placeName key="engl"

                            I should<lb/><pb n="180" facs="SW_TE1834_177"/>be very glad to obtain information of the kind
                            of<lb/>work carried on; if the product is sufficient to pay<lb/>for
                            their support, clothing, &amp;c. I expect there are<lb/>printed accounts
                            of them; and also some late books,<lb/>or pamphlets, on crimes and
                            punishments, and on<lb/> prisons. I therefore take the liberty to
                            request of<lb/>thee, to be so obliging as to give my good friend,<lb/>
                            <persName key="cwilk1">Charles Wilkes</persName>, a memorandum of such
                            as in thy<lb/>opinion may be worth my procuring. I should be<lb/>very
                            glad to obtain the report of the Committee of<lb/>the House of Commons,
                            on Bentley's plan; also, any<lb/>or
                            all of his writings. I have <persName key="jhowa1">Howard</persName>,
                            and the first<lb/>edition of Police of <placeName key="lond"
                                >London</placeName> and Thames. If thou<lb/>hast published any thing
                            lately, be pleased to insert<lb/>it in the list. My friend <persName
                                key="cwilk1">Wilkes</persName> will take the trou-<lb/>ble of
                            procuring from the booksellers, and forward-<lb/>ing to me, such books
                            as thou wilt be so obliging as<lb/>to recommend.</p>
                        <p>I enclose the last report of the inspectors of the<lb/>state prison to
                            the legislature; they passed a law to<lb/>build a prison, for solitary
                            confinement, on the plan<lb/>recommended in the Report. I have often
                            thought<lb/>that this would be an excellent plan in the city
                                of<lb/><placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, for the punishment
                            of petty offences, and<lb/>for preventing greater ones.</p>
                        <p>I am clearly of opinion, that <emph rend="italic">all</emph> prisons
                            intended<lb/>for the confinement of convicts for a term of
                            years<lb/>should be so constructed as that they should lodge
                            in<lb/>separate rooms; by being kept thus solitary and sepa-<lb/>rate
                            from each other, it would be more likely to<lb/>produce reformation, and
                            prevent escapes.</p>
                        <p>There are in the prison 145 of the convicts employ-<lb/>ed at shoemaking,
                            and that business has hitherto<lb/>been carried on, by purchasing
                            leather, &amp;c., and dis-<lb/>posing of the shoes and boots when
                            manufactured.<lb/>As this required a considerable capital, and
                            was<lb/>always attended with inconvenience, we have lately<lb/>dropped
                            conducting the business in this mode, and<lb/>have agreed with
                            shoemakers in the city, to take in<lb/><pb n="181" facs="SW_TE1834_178"/>work at a fixed
                            price, for making each pair of shoes<lb/>and hoots, according to the
                            size and quality—in this<lb/>manner of employing those 145 men, they now
                            earn<lb/> twelve hundred dollars per month, and it is now cer-<lb/>tain,
                            that the labour performed by the prisoners will<lb/>be more than
                            sufficient to support and clothe them,<lb/>pay for bringing them from
                            the counties, and other<lb/>incidental expenses.</p>
                        <p>I have hitherto acted as agent, but the system being<lb/>now completed,
                            equal to my most sanguine expecta-<lb/>tion, I intend this summer to

                        <p> Your very acceptable letter of the <date when="1802-06-06">6th
                                June</date>, accom-<lb/>panied by your valuable and interesting
                            publication,<lb/>giving an account of the State Penitentiary House
                            in<lb/>the city of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, was
                            recently left, at my house<lb/>in <placeName key="westm1"
                                >Westminster</placeName>, by <persName key="cwilk1">Mr.
                                Wilkes</persName>, and has since been<lb/>transmitted to me to the
                            country, to which I have<lb/>retired for a short time, with a view to a
                            little<lb/>relaxation from the labours attached to an arduous<lb/>public
                            duty.</p>
                        <p> My temporary retirement has furnished me with<lb/>an early opportunity
                            of perusing with attention, and<lb/>also with much interest, your very
                            excellent state-<lb/>ment of important and useful facts, and I
                            consider<lb/> myself under infinite obligations to you, not only
                            for<lb/>the knowledge of these facts, but for the acquaint-<lb/>ance of
                            the worthy and respectable author, who has<lb/>devoted so much time, and
                            made so many sacrifices,<lb/>to promote the cause of humanity, and the
                            good of<lb/>his fellow creatures.</p>
                        <p>It is a peculiar gratification to me, to have thus<lb/><pb n="182" facs="SW_TE1834_179"/>
                            discovered that my literary productions have fallen<lb/>under the
                            cognizance of one who is able, and also<lb/>so thoroughly disposed, to
                            carry the principles they<lb/>contain, on the subject of crimes and
                            punishments,<lb/>into practice; and it is no small gratification to
                            me<lb/>to find, that upon a subject so interesting to virtue<lb/>and
                            humanity, our sentiments are completely in<lb/>unison.</p>
                        <p>Your exertions, and those of your worthy colleagues,<lb/>appears to have
                            done much for the State of <placeName key="newyo"
                                >New<lb/>York</placeName>, and I entertain no doubt of the
                            sentiments of<lb/>all the worthy and reflecting part of the
                            community<lb/>being on your side in a short time; that the great<lb/>and
                            good work, your unexampled perseverance has<lb/>so happily accomplished,
                            will produce consequences<lb/>which will not only bring conviction to
                            the minds of<lb/>the most prejudiced, but also that you will live to
                            see<lb/>and experience that reward, in the ultimate and<lb/>complete
                            success of the design, which, to a mind like<lb/>yours, must go far
                            beyond the praises and encomiums<lb/>of the world. Your details are so
                            clear, so accurate<lb/>and interesting, that they will be read with
                            avidity<lb/>all over Europe.</p>
                        <p>To me it has been no small gratification, although<lb/>I have, on account
                            of the war and other circumstan-<lb/>ces, made as yet small progress in
                            the objects I have<lb/> recommended to be adopted in this country, that
                            my<lb/>writings have been translated into most of the<lb/>languages in
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>, with a prospect of
                            general<lb/> benefit to mankind, since, in all countries, the
                            vices<lb/>and crimes of individuals are similar, and only differ<lb/>as
                            to their extent.</p>
                        <p>I had read some years since, with the most heart-<lb/>felt pleasure, two
                            different accounts of that most<lb/>excellent institution, the
                            Penitentiary House in the<lb/>city of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>, which is the more valuable as<lb/>it
                            furnishes an irrefragable proof to all <placeName key="euro"
                                >Europe</placeName>, as<lb/>well as America, that the great
                            desideratum has<lb/> been accomplished, of rendering the labour of
                            crimi-<lb/><pb n="183" facs="SW_TE1834_180"/>nals productive, to a degree more than equal
                            to their<lb/>maintenance, and what is of more importance,
                            of<lb/>restoring them again to society with amended morals,<lb/>and in a
                            situation to become useful instead of<lb/>noxious members of the
                            community.</p>
                        <p>The criminal police is an object of the greatest im-<lb/>portance in all
                            countries, but particularly in America,<lb/>not only as a new country,
                            but as a Republic, ex-<lb/>posed, from peculiar circumstances, to be
                            contami-<lb/>nated by importations of the scum and outcasts of<lb/>all
                            Europe. This, and other considerations, have<lb/>excited great doubts in
                            my mind, whether the intro-<lb/>duction of Europeans in the present
                            state of the popu-<lb/>lation of America, is not, upon the whole,
                            injurious.<lb/>This is exemplified in no inconsiderable degree
                            in<lb/>the comparative view you have given of the coun-<lb/>tries to
                            which the different classes of convicts belong.<lb/>It might be
                            difficult and invidious to exclude the<lb/>white people of Europe, and
                            might be a reflection<lb/>upon the national character; but, surely, this
                            policy<lb/>does not apply to the negroes of the West Indies,<lb/>who, I
                            perceive, tend, in no inconsiderable degree,<lb/>to increase the
                            calendars of delinquency.</p>
                        <p>You have been rightly informed, that several very<lb/> expensive Houses
                            of Correction have been estab-<lb/>lished in <placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName>, within the last twenty years,<lb/>under the
                            authority of acts of Parliament, the out-<lb/>lines of which I have laid
                            before the public; but<lb/>although the expense has been excessive, (in
                            one in-<lb/>stance 80,000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. sterling,) I am
                            sorry to say, that, how-<lb/>ever excellent the theory, by a fatality
                            which is not<lb/>easy to be explained, no results that can be held
                            out<lb/>as an example, can be exhibited. In one or two,
                            in<lb/>particular, <emph rend="italic"><placeName key="oxfor"
                                    >Oxford</placeName> and <placeName key="glouc1"
                                    >Gloster</placeName></emph>, where, (like the Peni-<lb/>tentiary
                            House at <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>) some benevolent
                            cha-<lb/>racters have devoted much time and attention to the<lb/>economy
                            of the establishments, the labour of the con-<lb/>victs has been
                            rendered, in a certain degree produc-<lb/>tive.—We have a superb
                            establishment in <placeName key="midse">Middlesex</placeName>,<lb/><pb
                                n="184" facs="SW_TE1834_181"/>to which I bestowed much attention at the outset,<lb/>but,
                            instead of being seconded, I found myself coun-<lb/>teracted in all my
                            anxious cares to introduce a sys-<lb/>tem of useful and productive
                            labour, and I lament to<lb/>say, that, in addition to fourscore thousand
                            pounds<lb/>laid out in the buildings, it costs the county
                                nearly<lb/>4000<emph rend="italic">l</emph>. sterling a year, to
                            maintain the prisoners.—<lb/>Contemplating the difficulties and the
                            consequent<lb/>failure of most of the plans founded on <persName
                                key="jhowa1">Mr. Howard</persName>'s<lb/>ideas, and considering the
                            obstructions which are<lb/>opposed to evils, in their nature so
                            gigantic, I have<lb/>been induced to give a decided preference to
                                <persName key="jbent2">Mr.<lb/>Bentham</persName>'s plan, as briefly
                            explained in my treatise<lb/>on the police, (6th edition) where he
                            proposes to<lb/>enter into a contract for the labour of convicts,
                            and<lb/>to become responsible for the reformation of their<lb/>manners
                            and vices.—When I return to <placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, I
                            will<lb/>procure from that gentleman a copy of the detail of<lb/>his
                            plan and will have great pleasure in transmit-<lb/>ting it to you, with
                            such other publications as apply<lb/>to the subject of Penitentiary
                            Houses. I will also send,<lb/>if I can possibly procure it, a copy of a
                            report of the<lb/>Committee of the House of Commons.—The whole<lb/>of
                            the reports have been reprinted in four volumes,<lb/>among which
                            twenty-eight treats of Police. They<lb/>are all extremely interesting,
                            and, I think, you will<lb/>be desirous that they should have a place in
                            your<lb/>library; when I have the pleasure of seeing <persName
                                key="cwilk1">Mr.<lb/>Wilkes</persName>, I will consult with him how
                            far I should go<lb/>in this respect. The first edition of the police of<lb/>
                            <placeName key="lond">London</placeName> may be considered as only an
                                <emph rend="italic">imperfect sketch</emph>.<lb/>It is in the
                            sixth-edition of that work that you will<lb/>find those interesting
                            topics discussed, to which your<lb/>attention is at present so laudably
                            directed.</p>
                        <p>The last report of your committee is extremely<lb/>interesting, and you
                            press upon the attention of the<lb/>legislature, with great propriety,
                            the evils arising<lb/>from the excessive multiplication of <emph

                                >public houses</emph>. Nothing tends so much to the corrup-<lb/><pb
                                    n="185" facs="SW_TE1834_182"/>tion of morals, or to promote habits of idleness,
                            ulti-<lb/>mately generating crimes: 1200 of these receptacles<lb/>of
                            vice in so small a city as <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>,
                            are to be con-<lb/>sidered as an evil of the greatest magnitude. In
                            the<lb/> metropolis of the British Empire, which contains<lb/>twelve
                            times the number of inhabitants, the magis-<lb/>trates do not grant
                            licences to more than about 4000,<lb/>although, taking in the towns and
                            villages in the<lb/>vicinity, we have upwards of 5000 in the whole.
                            I<lb/>have been at great pains, in forming and enforcing<lb/>rules and
                            orders for the proper regulation of publi-<lb/>cans, in different
                            districts of the metropolis, where I<lb/>have acted as a magistrate—a
                            copy of which I will<lb/>send you. The indiscriminate mixture of young
                            and<lb/>old offenders, in the same prison, I observe, is men-<lb/>tioned
                            with great propriety in your last report. I<lb/>have always considered
                            this practice (which also<lb/>prevails here) as one of the greatest
                            nurseries of<lb/>crimes; and I am glad to find you have brought it<lb/>
                            under the review of your legislature. The remedy<lb/>you propose,
                            appears to me to be the wisest and most<lb/>effectual that can be
                            devised.</p>
                        <p>Your proposition to authorize the police magis-<lb/>trates to try, in a
                            summary way, all persons committing<lb/>minor offences, such as petty
                            assaults, drunkenness,<lb/>and acts of vagrancy, &amp;c., will prove a
                            great relief to<lb/> juries, and will tend much to the diminution
                            of<lb/>crimes. In this country, the legislature finds it<lb/>necessary
                            every session, to extend the summary<lb/> jurisdiction of magistrates;
                            and experience has shown,<lb/>(as these magistrates are responsible,)
                            that instead of<lb/>abridging, it extends the liberty of the innocent
                            part<lb/>of the community; and I can safely affirm, that had<lb/>it not
                            been for these summary jurisdictions, it would<lb/>have been impossible,
                            in any degree, to have kept<lb/>the vices and crimes of the people
                            within any mode-<lb/>rate bounds. The present state of society and
                            morals,<lb/>in <emph rend="italic">what is called the civilized
                                world</emph>, render a species<lb/>of energy necessary, which can
                            only be attained by<lb/><pb n="186" facs="SW_TE1834_183"/>summary proceedings. The great
                            inlets to vice,<lb/>idleness, and crimes, are, <emph rend="italic">ill
                                regulated public houses,<lb/> gaming, horse-racing, cock-fighting,
                                profane swearing</emph>,<lb/>and <emph rend="italic">a contempt of
                                religious duties on a Sunday</emph>: to<lb/>which may be added,
                            generally, every species of dis-<lb/>sipation, which has a tendency to
                            congregate multi-<lb/>tudes of people on the same spot. In a new
                            country<lb/>like America, where the general prosperity of the<lb/>nation
                            depends, in so eminent a degree, on the morals<lb/>of the people, the
                            legislature cannot promote the true<lb/>welfare of the state, in a
                            greater degree, than by<lb/> authorizing magistrates to correct these
                            evils, by<lb/>inflicting mild punishments in a summary way, and<lb/>by
                            commuting, in various instances that will occur,<lb/>the punishment of
                                <emph rend="italic">imprisonment</emph> by <emph rend="italic"

                            in<lb/>America, also requires appropriate laws, which will<lb/>apply to
                            both sexes; and those should be adminis-<lb/>tered in a summary way by
                            the magistrates, by<lb/><emph rend="italic">imprisonment</emph>, or
                                <emph rend="italic">mild pecuniary fines</emph>. In like

                            circuitous process of indictment and trial by<lb/>jury. The expense of
                            such prosecutions in this<lb/>country, tend much to the increase of the
                            evils of<lb/>prostitution, while, through the medium of the
                            chi-<lb/>cane of the law, many notorious delinquents
                            escape<lb/>justice.</p>
                        <p>I could not have conceived, until I perused your<lb/>accurate reports,
                            that such a number of larcenies<lb/>could have been committed in the

                            impossible that depredations to such an extent<lb/>should be committed,
                            unless there were many <emph rend="italic">receiv-<lb/>ers of stolen
                                goods</emph>; such as <emph rend="italic">purchasers of old

                                rags, and hand stuff &amp;c.</emph><lb/>These classes of dealers
                            require the watchful eye of<lb/>the legislature, and much advantage
                            would be derived,<lb/>from restraining them from dealing, unless under
                            the<lb/> authority of a licence, with power to the magistrates<lb/><pb
                                n="187" facs="SW_TE1834_184"/>to withhold it on the succeeding year, in case of any<lb/>
                            information of improper conduct, and to forfeit it,<lb/>in case of
                            conviction—a power also to constables, to<lb/>stop and examine the
                            persons who convey parcels,<lb/>&amp;c. after dark, and to punish the
                            offenders if they<lb/> cannot give a satisfactory account to the
                            magistrate,<lb/>how they obtained the same, would tend much to<lb/>the
                            prevention of crimes. It is by these precau-<lb/>tions, and by mild
                            summary punishments, that the<lb/>calendars of delinquency are to be
                            diminished in<lb/>every country, and a wise legislature will look
                                to<lb/><emph rend="italic">prevention as a primary object</emph>,
                            that there may be<lb/>occasion as seldom as possible, to resort to
                            punish-<lb/>ment.</p>
                        <p>As temperance operates powerfully in preventing<lb/>diseases in the human
                            body, so will preventives tend<lb/>to diminish the evils in the body
                            politic. In America,<lb/>where old prejudices do not exist, and where
                            the<lb/>laws in their progress are verging towards maturity,<lb/>this
                            preventive system can be much easier accom<lb/>plished than in
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>, and if the legislature is
                            true<lb/>to itself, it will see the vast importance of

                                >New<lb/>York</placeName>, has been considered of so much interest
                            and<lb/>importance, by several very elevated characters in
                            this<lb/>country, that a proposition has been made to reprint<lb/>it. It

                            in this<lb/>country. According to your desire, I have occasion-<lb/>ally
                            been employed, for some time past, in collecting<lb/>every publication
                            which appears to me to bear on<lb/>subjects of this nature, as well as
                            on other topics of<lb/>political economy, which have appeared to me to
                            be<lb/>analogous. The whole are sent in a box addressed<lb/>to you, by

                            particularly to request that<lb/>you will accept of them from me, as a
                            mark of my<lb/> esteem and regard.</p>
                        <p>You will trace in these various tracts a very great<lb/>portion of zeal
                            and genuine philanthropy, as well as<lb/>strong marks of extensive
                            reading and profound<lb/>knowledge, on subjects calculated to promote

                            considerable proportion of the lower classes of<lb/>society; and hence
                            it is that crimes multiply, and<lb/>that the adult becomes often
                            enervated and useless to<lb/>society at that period of life, when labour
                            ought to<lb/>be most productive.</p>
                        <p>Upon the subject of education, the reports which I<lb/>have transmitted,
                            published by the society for better-<lb/>ing the condition of the poor,
                            furnish many excellent<lb/>hints and suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The next object, as it relates to criminal offences,<lb/>and which is of
                            the highest importance to civil<lb/>society, is a proper attention to
                            those, whose indi-<lb/>gence or idleness render them burdens upon
                            the<lb/>other classes of society. This evil becomes a hydra<lb/>in every
                            nation, where appropriate regulations do not<lb/>exist for educating the
                            offspring of indigent and<lb/> profligate parents, or orphans who are
                            cast upon the<lb/>public; and also for propping up adults, reduced to
                            a<lb/><pb n="190" facs="SW_TE1834_187"/>state of extreme poverty and wretchedness, so as
                            to<lb/>compel them, at least to the extent of their abilities,<lb/>to
                            assist themselves. The want of appropriate regu-<lb/>lations, under an
                            accurate and correct management,<lb/>as it applies to this very
                            difficult branch of political<lb/>economy, is one of the chief causes of
                            the numerous<lb/>criminal offences which afflict society in <placeName

                        <p>Upon this important branch of political economy,<lb/>much useful
                            information will be found in the reports<lb/>of the society of the poor,
                            exhibiting a vast scope for<lb/>the exertion both of public and private
                            benevolence,<lb/>particularly the latter; as it respects the former,

                                >Jeremy Bentham</persName>,<lb/>Esq., furnish much curious and
                            important matter,<lb/>which will be read with great interest by the
                            philo-<lb/>sopher, the statesman, and the philanthropist.</p>
                        <p>Periods of scarcity are not so likely to happen in<lb/>America as in
                                <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>: yet as the food of man
                            rises<lb/>to an enormous price in the United States, as often<lb/>as
                            extraordinary demands are made upon you, the<lb/>condition of your poor,
                            in the large cities, must, in a<lb/>certain degree, claim the occasional
                            attention of the<lb/>benevolent; and therefore, as it may be interesting
                            to<lb/> know what has been accomplished in this country,<lb/>and
                            particularly in this great metropolis, during the<lb/>recent periods of
                            scarcity, I have taken the liberty<lb/>to send you several tracts, and
                            other papers, upon this<lb/>subject, which have been chiefly compiled by
                            myself<lb/>for the use of the public, and the various societies<lb/>with
                            which I was connected, where I generally had<lb/>the labouring oar.
                            These papers are the more inte-<lb/>resting, as they tend to prove how
                            much may be<lb/>gained by an economizing system, and at how small<lb/>an
                            expense, under proper management, it is possible<lb/><pb n="191" facs="SW_TE1834_188"/>to
                            feed and to prop up families in distress. The<lb/>attention and labour
                            are indeed excessive; and the<lb/>reward to the numerous benevolent

                            will find much useful<lb/>and interesting information, calculated to
                            improve<lb/> the state of civil society, as it relates to the
                            poor,<lb/>and to analogous distempers, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the
                            last<lb/>subject, namely, analogous fevers, and particularly<lb/>the
                            typhus or jail distemper, you will find some<lb/>new and interesting
                            information, in a tract detailing<lb/>a variety of successful
                            experiments, which has been<lb/>published and circulated by the society
                            for bettering<lb/>the condition of the poor, by which it appears
                            emer-<lb/>sion in water, or the shower bath, is a certain cure.</p>
                        <p>Turning from this subject, to that which relates to<lb/>the preservation
                            of morals, and the prevention of<lb/>criminal offences, I must refer you
                            to my observations<lb/>on public houses, (of which I send you two
                            copies,)<lb/>and also my treatise, recently published, on the
                            duty<lb/>of a constable. The first will furnish some useful<lb/>hints
                            relative to regulations which, ere long, will be<lb/>found necessary in
                            America, (particularly in the large<lb/>towns,) with respect to dram
                            shops, and the excessive<lb/>and unrestrained use of spirituous liquors,
                            than which,<lb/>when indulged in to excess, nothing can be
                            more<lb/>pernicious, both to the health and morals of the<lb/>labouring
                            people. It is the chief source of the multi-<lb/>plication of crimes,
                            which afflict society in the city<lb/>of <placeName key="nycit"
                                >New-York</placeName>;—to which I might add, those persons<lb/>who
                            are permitted, without control or inspection, to<lb/><pb n="192" facs="SW_TE1834_189"/>deal
                            in <emph rend="italic">old metals, old ships stores, and apparel
                                and<lb/>furniture bought at second hand</emph>. The first,
                            namely,<lb/>dram shops, corrupt the morals; while the second,
                            by<lb/>holding out facilities to thieves, by purchasing what-<lb/>ever
                            may be offered for sale, without asking questions,<lb/>and that too at
                            an under price, become the fosterers of<lb/>crimes.</p>
                        <p>In the tract on constables, you will see, under<lb/> various heads, what
                            provisions our laws have made<lb/>for the prevention of the corruption
                            of morals, and<lb/>the commission of crimes. By the adoption of
                            the<lb/>farther regulations recommended in my treatise on<lb/>the police
                            of the metropolis, and also by the select<lb/>committee of the House of
                            Commons, much might be<lb/>done in this country to diminish the number
                            of<lb/> offenders of all descriptions. Not being able to pro-<lb/>cure a
                            copy of this very interesting report in a separate<lb/>volume, an
                            opportunity is afforded me of requesting<lb/>your acceptance of the
                            whole of the interesting reports<lb/> of the select committee on
                            finance, from which the<lb/>statesman, the politician, the financier,
                            and the poli-<lb/>tical economist, will be able to acquire much
                            useful<lb/>information, highly beneficial to America. The<lb/>

                        <p>On the subject of prisons in this country, I have<lb/>only farther to
                            call your attention to a work just<lb/> published by <persName
                                key="jniel1">James Nield</persName>, Esq., who, following the<lb/>

                            poor persons confined for civil debts, to whom, as<lb/>you will observe
                            from his work, and also from his<lb/>exertions as treasurer of the

                        <p>On the subject of punishments, I send you inclosed<lb/>the last statement
                            of the delivery of the gaol at <placeName key="newga">New-<lb/>
                                gate</placeName>, which has been recently sent me by the

                            the<lb/>disposal of prisoners for the last year, for the

                            at the Old Bailey. In this statement, how-<lb/>ever, neither the

                            believe they are equal, or per-<lb/>haps exceed, the number stated in
                            the last (sixth<lb/>edition) of the treatise on the police.</p>
                        <p>The only use which can be made of this melan-<lb/>choly catalogue of
                            depravity, is to stimulate those in<lb/>power, in every country, to the
                            adoption of such<lb/>measures, as shall forewarn the unwary, arrest
                            the<lb/><pb n="194" facs="SW_TE1834_191"/>hands of evil doers, and thereby lessen the
                            demand<lb/>for punishment. To you, sir, and to many other<lb/>benevolent
                            characters, the United States are under<lb/> great obligations; but your
                            labours are not yet<lb/>terminated. Since by punishment alone, we are
                            not<lb/>to look for that amelioration in the state of society,<lb/>which
                            is to arise from the diminution of crimes,<lb/>the minds of your chief
                            magistrates and active<lb/>senators, ought ever to be alive to the means
                            of<lb/>prevention. To those who are likely to commit<lb/>offences, there
                            cannot be a greater act of humanity;<lb/>while on society at large, a
                            greater benefit cannot be<lb/>conferred. It is not the mere loss of
                            property that<lb/>is to be deplored. In the ramifications of vice
                            extend-<lb/>ed broad and wide, a nation bleeds at every pore in<lb/>that
                            general contamination, which poisons the mind,<lb/>renders the corporeal
                            functions useless, and abridges<lb/> that industry and exertion in
                            beneficial labour, which<lb/>constitutes the support of every state and
                            body<lb/>politic.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to frame excellent laws to punish<lb/>delinquents. The
                            history of all civilized countries,<lb/>has proved how inefficacious
                            they are in the improve-<lb/>ment of morals. With every attention which
                            human<lb/>wisdom can bestow, where multitudes are congre-<lb/>gated
                            together in gaols, who have long been apostates<lb/>from virtue, vice
                            must in general be triumphant.<lb/>As you advance in population, under
                            the unavoidable<lb/>hazard of contamination by frequent
                            importations<lb/>of depraved characters, who have fled, in many<lb/>
                            instances, from the punishment due to their crimes<lb/>in <placeName
                                key="euro">Europe</placeName>, a vigilant and active preventive
                            police<lb/>becomes necessary. Nor should a free country com-<lb/>plain
                            of such a system, since crimes and criminal<lb/>people constantly
                            abridge the privileges of innocence.<lb/>Restraints which attach only to
                            evil doers, can never<lb/>disturb the proceedings of the peaceful
                            citizen in the<lb/>general intercourse of society. Let the American<lb/>
                            government, before it becomes too unwieldy, guard<lb/><pb n="195" facs="SW_TE1834_192"/>the
                            morals of its people as its best prop. What may<lb/>be found easy and
                            practicable in the yet infant state<lb/>of society, may become
                            difficult, and perhaps impossi-<lb/>ble, when evil habits descend from
                            generation to<lb/> generation, until at length it becomes too gigantic
                            for<lb/>human exertion. Comparatively speaking, the country<lb/>is yet
                            virtuous. To permit it to retrograde, as it<lb/>becomes more wealthy and
                            more populous, by an<lb/> inattention to the general progress of evil
                            habits,<lb/>would be to entail upon posterity an excessive<lb/>calamity.
                            The task is certainly not difficult at<lb/>present, since in the country
                            there is little to fear, and<lb/> hence it would seem, that the energy
                            of police would<lb/>only be necessary in the great towns, checking
                            and<lb/>restraining those propensities, which lead to the
                            cor-<lb/>ruption of morals. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that<lb/>an
                            indulgence in many propensities, which half a<lb/>century ago were
                            divested of their evil consequences,<lb/>from the then infant state of
                            society, became noxious<lb/>as population increases. It is then <emph
                                rend="italic">drunkenness,<lb/>gaming, lewdness</emph>, and other
                            offences, leading to the<lb/>corruption of morals, acquire their sting.
                            They pro-<lb/>mote idleness; while want of employment, where<lb/>labour
                            is necessary for subsistence, is the never failing<lb/>inroad to
                            crimes.</p>
                        <p>I am induced to enlarge upon this subject, from<lb/>the facts you have
                            disclosed, relative to the criminal<lb/>offences committed in the city
                            of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>. They<lb/>appear to me to
                            be of a magnitude to excite a con-<lb/>siderable degree of alarm with
                            respect to the increase<lb/>of criminality in the American towns;
                            inasmuch as<lb/>it would appear that they greatly exceed the number<lb/>
                            of larcenies and misdemeanours, committed in towns<lb/>in Great Britain,
                            of an equal or even a greater popu-<lb/>lation; and although I have not
                            had an opportunity<lb/>of ascertaining the fact, I have an impression on
                            my<lb/>mind, that the annual convictions in the whole of<lb/>Scotland,
                            where the population approaches two<lb/>millions of people, are short of
                            those which take<lb/><pb n="196" facs="SW_TE1834_193"/>place yearly in the state of
                                <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>; and yet
                            that<lb/>country, from the rapid influx of riches and luxury,<lb/>and
                            extensive manufactures, cannot be said to be<lb/>improving in morals. I
                            fear the reverse is the case;<lb/>since I have been recently applied to
                            by some of the<lb/>first public characters in that country, to
                            suggest<lb/>means for the improvement of their police.
                            Arrange-<lb/>ments and checks upon evil propensities, must be<lb/>
                            accommodated gradually to the existing state of<lb/>society. The
                            intention of all governments is to render<lb/>human nature as perfect as
                            possible, since from this<lb/>perfection results the security and the
                            comfort of the<lb/> whole; but errors and imperfections incident
                            to<lb/>human nature are unfavourable, and ever will be so,<lb/>to such a
                            state of things, which can only be main-<lb/>tained by good and
                            appropriate laws, wisely and<lb/>prudently administered.</p>
                        <p>If the information I have transmitted, or what I<lb/>have communicated in
                            this and my former letter,<lb/>(which I hope you have received,) can be
                            of use in<lb/>promoting any of your benevolent objects for
                            the<lb/>benefit of your country, it will afford me the
                            sincerest<lb/>pleasure.</p>

                            proper for me to state, that, having<lb/><pb n="199" facs="SW_TE1834_196"/>devoted the last
                            seven years wholly to the promotion<lb/>of a favourite object, the
                            amelioration of the penal<lb/>laws, and the establishment of a
                            penitentiary house<lb/>in this state, I have been prevented from
                            bestowing<lb/>the necessary attention to my private affairs.</p>
                        <p>This object, which I have had so much at heart,<lb/>being now so far
                            accomplished, and put into a train<lb/>of successful experiment, as to
                            permit me to with-<lb/>draw from that close application which has
                            been<lb/>hitherto requisite, I shall have leisure to attend to<lb/>other
                            things.</p>
                        <p>Some property which I have in <placeName key="vermo">Vermont</placeName>,
                            and <placeName key="penns">Penn-<lb/>sylvania</placeName>, will demand
                            my earliest regard. Not in-<lb/>tending to return again to mercantile
                            pursuits, I<lb/>mean to give some portion of the remainder of
                            my<lb/>life (as Providence may spare it) to the service of
                            the<lb/>poorer classes of society.—It would not, therefore,
                            be<lb/>agreeable to have any considerable obstacle inter-<lb/>posed,
                            which may impede the course I wish to pur-<lb/>sue.—But the scheme of
                            action I have proposed to<lb/>myself, will not prevent my using every
                            exertion to<lb/>promote thy interests, and to fulfil thy wishes.</p>
                        <p>In whatever I do for thee, I beg to be clearly under-<lb/>stood, as
                            disclaiming every pecuniary compensation,<lb/>beyond the actual and
                            necessary expense attending<lb/>the transactions; but I may find it for
                            thy interest,<lb/>and my own satisfaction, to use the advice and
                            assist-<lb/>ance of my particular and valuable friend, <persName
                                key="wjohn2">William<lb/>Johnson</persName>, Esquire, of this city,
                            whose disposition will<lb/>prompt him to feel an equal and lively
                            interest in<lb/>whatever concerns thee, as he has read thy
                            works<lb/>with singular avidity and pleasure, and has conceived<lb/>the
                            highest respect for thee; and if he can be induced<lb/>to accept it, I
                            should cheerfully relinquish to him<lb/>every compensation which thee
                            may feel disposed,<lb/>in the result of the business to bestow.—I should
                            pre-<lb/>fer, if it meets thy approbation, to have his name
                            in-<lb/>serted with mine, in thy power of attorney, as from<lb/> my
                            intimacy with him, founded on a clear knowledge<lb/><pb n="200" facs="SW_TE1834_197"/>of his
                            integrity, his philanthropy, and excellent<lb/>talents, that it would
                            decidedly be to thy interest and<lb/>advantage.</p>

                        <p>I have not yet time to read all the books which<lb/>thou sent me; but
                            intend to do so very soon, and<lb/>shall write to <persName key="wpitt1"

                        <p>I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of<lb/>thy very acceptable
                            and instructive letter, of <date when="1803-02-16"
                                >16th<lb/>February</date>, and to request thee to accept my
                            sincere<lb/><pb n="201" facs="SW_TE1834_198"/>thanks for the information it contains;
                            and, particu-<lb/>larly, for the truly valuable and interesting
                            collection<lb/>of books and pamphlets, with which it was
                            accom-<lb/>panied. These productions display, in a most stri-<lb/>king
                            manner, the zeal of the English nation (distin-<lb/>guished above all
                            others for its extensive practice of<lb/>Christian charity) in the great
                            cause of benevolence<lb/>and humanity. The perusal of them will
                            furnish<lb/>many valuable hints to myself and others, in this<lb/>
                            country, and animate us to follow the illustrious<lb/>example which you
                            have set before us. Happy for<lb/>us, many of the evils which afflict
                            and deform the<lb/>more populous societies in Europe, either do not
                            exist<lb/>among us, or only appear in a small degree. This<lb/>exemption
                            is the result of the peculiar state of the<lb/>country, where the wants
                            of men are easily supplied,<lb/>the incentives to industry and
                            enterprise numerous<lb/>and powerful, and temptations to vice
                            comparatively<lb/>few. Thy excellent remarks, however, on
                            public<lb/>education, and the preventive system of police,
                            are<lb/>applicable to America, as well as every other nation;<lb/>and I
                            have thought them of so much importance,<lb/>and so likely to do good,
                            that I have taken the liberty<lb/>to make thy letter public; coming from
                            one so dis-<lb/>tinguished for his knowledge on the subjects,
                            and<lb/>whose character and station claims the highest re-<lb/>spect,
                            they will have much greater weight than any<lb/>thing that could be said
                            by one of our own citizens.<lb/>I trust the motives which have actuated
                            me, will be<lb/>a sufficient apology for the freedom I have taken
                            in<lb/>giving thy letter to the world.</p>
                        <p>Your society for bettering the condition of the poor,<lb/>is a most
                            excellent institution, and cannot fail to pro-<lb/>duce the most happy
                            effect. This, and similar asso-<lb/>ciations, reflect the highest honour
                            on your country.<lb/> The immense sums bestowed in charity, and
                            the<lb/>active exertions of so many enlightened and digni-<lb/>fied
                            characters, in works of benevolence, is indeed<lb/>without example. If
                            the good produced be, in any<lb/><pb n="202" facs="SW_TE1834_199"/>degree, proportionate to
                            the extent of the means em-<lb/>ployed, much misery must be prevented,
                            and many<lb/>evils be exterminated. Your efforts in establishing a<lb/>
                            preventive system, and in diffusing a knowledge of<lb/>the means of
                            self-correction to the lower classes of<lb/>society, are the wisest that
                            can be imagined; you<lb/>strike at once at the root of the tree of evil,
                            instead<lb/> of lopping a branch here and there, which, sooner<lb/>or
                            later, shoots out again in new vigour.</p>
                        <p>The United States, particularly those states in<lb/> which slavery is
                            unknown, or almost eradicated,<lb/>possess signal advantages for
                            securing themselves<lb/>from the dreadful evils which oppress society in
                                <placeName key="euro">Eu-<lb/>rope</placeName>; happy will they be,
                            if they have foresight and<lb/>wisdom enough rightly to estimate, and
                            use, the<lb/>means that Providence has been pleased thus to put<lb/>into
                            their hands.</p>
                        <p> A law passed our state legislature, authorizing the<lb/>corporation of
                            this city to erect a prison for solitary<lb/>confinement, to be <emph
                                rend="italic">solely</emph> for the punishment of
                            petty<lb/>offenders, to be kept on low diet, and in solitary<lb/>
                            apartments, for a term not exceeding ninety days;<lb/> some accounts of
                            this plan may be seen in the<lb/>account of the State Prison, page 62.
                            From observing<lb/>the effects of this mode of punishment, in the
                            State<lb/>Prison, where it is used to correct those who violate<lb/>the
                            rules of the prison, by profane swearing, quar-<lb/>relling, want of
                            cleanliness, or neglect of their alloted<lb/>task of labour, &amp;c., I
                            have been led to believe it is<lb/>the most efficacious that can
                            possibly be adopted.<lb/>The average number of convicts is nearly 400,
                            most<lb/>of whom observe a uniform, regular, and peaceable<lb/>course of
                            conduct; the hardened and refractory are<lb/>kept in good order, by
                            occasional punishment in the<lb/>cells, which strikes such a terror on
                            their minds, that<lb/>it often happens, that not a single person has
                            been<lb/>punished for eight or ten days. Certain I am, that
                            a<lb/>punishment of this kind will be far more beneficial<lb/>than that
                            of the Bridewell, or even the State Prison,<lb/><pb n="203" facs="SW_TE1834_200"/>for a short
                            term; nothing so effectually subdues the<lb/>intemperate and
                            ungovernable passions of men, and<lb/>checks the growth of depraved
                            habits. I am appre-<lb/>hensive the prison will not be erected the
                            present<lb/>year, but I retain a strong hope that the plan will<lb/>be
                            carried into effect.</p>
                        <p>By the Juliana, <persName key="cbrow1">Captain Brown</persName>, I sent a
                            small<lb/>box, containing a number of copies of the account of<lb/>the
                            State Prison, and reports for <date when="1802">1802</date>, for thyself
                            and<lb/>friends. The flattering result of this institution, to<lb/>be
                            found in this report, constitutes one of the most<lb/>pleasing
                            circumstances of my life, since it not only<lb/>exhibits the
                            practicability of a system calculated to<lb/>produce the greatest good
                            to society, but has entirely<lb/> removed those strong prejudices
                            against it, in the<lb/>minds of many good men, who often treated me
                            as<lb/>an enthusiast, and visionary, but who now are ad-<lb/>mirers of
                            the establishment, and the warmest ad-<lb/>vocates for the present penal
                            code.</p>
                        <p>I have the farther pleasure to state, that there is<lb/> abundant reason
                            to conclude, that the profits on the<lb/>labour of the convicts, for
                            tile current year, will be<lb/>considerably greater than at the time of
                            the last<lb/>report. I inclose an abstract of the accounts for
                            six<lb/>months, ending the <date when="1803-07-01">1st of the present

                                >London</placeName>, it would add very much to<lb/>the value of the
                            new edition, if the report last print-<lb/>ed was subjoined; and it
                            would give it additional<lb/>credit and circulation, if some remarks
                            were prefixed<lb/>by thee, such as would naturally occur to thy
                            mind,<lb/>and which thy leisure might permit thee to make.<lb/>If this
                            is undertaken, I should be glad if the book-<lb/>seller might be
                            directed to send me one or two hun-<lb/>dred copies, to be distributed
                            in this country, and I<lb/>will remit to him the cost.</p>
                        <p>On a late visit which I made to the Penitentiary<lb/>house in <placeName
                                key="newje">New Jersey</placeName>, I was disappointed to
                            find<lb/>that the plan of the building was bad, and little<lb/><pb
                                n="204" facs="SW_TE1834_201"/>adapted to answer the design of such an
                            establish-<lb/>ment; the Keeper appears to he a decent and
                            respect-<lb/>able man, and well qualified for his station;
                            the<lb/>apartments are not so cleanly as I expected to find<lb/>them.
                            There are fifty-nine convicts confined, fifty-<lb/>seven men, and two
                            women, who appeared decent,<lb/>orderly, and industrious; they were
                            employed in the<lb/> manufacture of nails, shoes, and cloth. The
                            Inspec-<lb/>tors are very worthy citizens, who reside in the
                            neigh-<lb/>bourhood of <placeName key="trent">Trenton</placeName>. They
                            informed me, that the<lb/>profit on the labour of the convicts, was
                            sufficient to<lb/>defray the expenses of the prison. It is about
                            four<lb/>years since its estabishment.</p>
                        <p>I also visited several times the prison of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Phila-<lb/>delphia</placeName>. This building was erected <emph
                                rend="italic">before</emph> the alter-<lb/>ations were made in their
                            penal code, and is, there-<lb/>fore, not well calculated for the purpose
                            of a peniten-<lb/>tiary. Prisoners <emph rend="italic">before</emph>
                            conviction, vagabonds, and<lb/>disorderly persons, are also kept there,
                            and the sys-<lb/>tem of order, &amp;c. does not appear equal to that
                                of<lb/><placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> prison. This
                            difference is not to be im-<lb/>puted to any inability, or want of
                            attention, of the<lb/>Inspectors of the former, but to circumstances not
                            in<lb/>their power to control. Unfortunately for <placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsyl-<lb/>vania</placeName>, the vast number of emigrants, from
                            every<lb/>country, who have settled there, and the violence of<lb/>party
                            spirit, tend much to distract the government,<lb/>and destroy the
                            influence of its best citizens. The<lb/>political changes in the
                            administration, caused by<lb/> this spirit, have also been extended to
                            the peniten-<lb/>tiary, and those who have most contributed to
                            its<lb/>establishment and support, are displaced to make<lb/>way for new
                            men, wholly unfit to manage its con-<lb/>cerns. The friends of the
                            institution feel apprehen-<lb/>sive of the effects of this change on its
                            future pros-<lb/>perity. It is, indeed, to be lamented, that the
                            spirit<lb/> of political parties should be so violent, as to
                            check<lb/>the progress of improvement, in what so
                            essentially<lb/>concerns the safety and happiness of all. But I
                            must<lb/><pb n="205" facs="SW_TE1834_202"/>apologize for touching on subjects of a
                            political na-<lb/>ture, so foreign to the design of this letter, and
                            the<lb/> habits and pursuits of my life.</p>
                        <p>The penitentiary house in <persName key="virgi">Virginia</persName> has
                            been estab-<lb/>lished about three years. The Inspectors are
                            respecta-<lb/>ble, good men, and are appointed by the Governor
                            and<lb/>Council, who also appoint the principal Keeper. I<lb/>am
                            informed, political reasons influenced the Governor<lb/>and Council, in
                            the appointment of a principal Keeper,<lb/>who disagreed with the
                            Inspectors, and refused to<lb/>submit to their directions, and is said
                            to be a very im-<lb/>proper person for his place. This proves the
                            propriety<lb/>of vesting in the Inspectors the power of
                            appointing<lb/>the Keeper, and making <emph rend="italic">them</emph>
                            responsible for his con-<lb/>duct. On the <date when="1803-01-05">5th
                                January</date> last, there were sixty-eight<lb/>convicts, who were
                            employed mostly at making nails<lb/>and shoes. They are allowed meat
                            only two days<lb/>in the week; other days, mush, with a small
                            portion<lb/>of molasses and potatoes. The laws of <placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName><lb/>direct, <quote>that the male convicts
                                shall have their <emph rend="italic">heads</emph><lb/>and beards
                                close shaven, at least once in every week.</quote><lb/>The
                            foundation of a similar prison, has been laid,<lb/>this year, at
                                <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName>. The state of society in
                                <placeName key="mass">Mas-<lb/>sachusetts</placeName>, is so very
                            favourable to good order and<lb/>improvement, the opinions and habits of
                            the people,<lb/>so consonant to the <emph rend="italic">true</emph>
                            principles of liberty and good<lb/> government, that there is every
                            reason to expect that<lb/>this establishment will be equal, in every
                            respect, to<lb/>any in America, and, I have no doubt, will
                            reflect<lb/>great honor on the state which formed it, and on the<lb/>
                            Inspectors who may have the management of its<lb/>internal
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The comparison made by thee, between the num-<lb/>ber of convicts in
                                <placeName key="scot">Scotland</placeName>, and this state, is
                            extreme-<lb/>ly unfavourable to the latter, and I am unwilling
                            to<lb/>admit the inference that might be made from it. As<lb/>to the
                            state of society here, I am certain, that a much<lb/>less number of
                            criminals escape conviction here, than<lb/>in Great Britain, an effect
                            that may be ascribed to<lb/><pb n="206" facs="SW_TE1834_203"/>the smallness of population,
                            the facility of detection,<lb/>great vigilance in the police, and the
                            mildness of our<lb/>punishments. If this be true, the calendar of
                            our<lb/>convicts may appear comparatively larger here,<lb/>while the
                            number of crimes may be, in part, much<lb/>less than in <placeName
                                key="scot">Scotland</placeName>. But, on this point, I do not<lb/>
                            possess sufficient information concerning that coun-<lb/>try, to draw
                            any satisfactory conclusion. Both there<lb/>and here, spirituous liquors
                            are, undoubtedly, the<lb/>great corrupters of morals. Alcohol, in all
                            its modi-<lb/>fications, is the insidious enemy of virtue and
                            happi-<lb/>ness ; it saps the foundation of all the useful
                            qualities<lb/>that belong to man, and is the great cause of
                            the<lb/>increase of vice and criminality. How is this wide<lb/>spreading
                            mischief to be destroyed? By an entire<lb/>prohibition of home
                            distillation, and a heavy impost<lb/>and excise on foreign spirits. But
                            this is impractica-<lb/>ble here; no legislature would dare to pass such
                            a<lb/>law, and no administration could carry it into exe-<lb/>cution. A
                            partial application of impost and excise<lb/>has produced some effect,
                            yet no great, in diminish-<lb/>ing the consumption in the country. It is
                            painful<lb/>to reflect, that it is only in our power to attempt
                            par-<lb/>tial remedies, and to endeavour to regulate what we<lb/>cannot
                            prevent. I hope, with the assistance of<lb/>others, to procure the
                            adoption of a plan to prevent the<lb/> increase of taverns and dram
                            shops in this city, and<lb/>to lessen the number of those which already
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>I regret that it is not in my power to make an ade-<lb/>quate return for
                            the large fund of valuable informa-<lb/>tion which thou hast been so

                            I have been so much pleased with the outlines<lb/>of it, that I have had
                            one thousand copies printed<lb/>in this city and <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>. I flatter myself his<lb/>plan will be

                            hope to introduce it<lb/>in a very large school, which I expect soon to

                            for the benefit of poor children, who are at<lb/>present under the care
                            of our alms house. I should<lb/>be much gratified to obtain such printed

                        <p>In the course of last year, some persons were<lb/>appointed inspectors of
                            our state prison, who, in my<lb/>opinion, were no way qualified to
                            promote the design<lb/>of the institution, and whose opinions respecting
                            the<lb/>general management and economy were widely<lb/>different from
                            mine, in consequence of which, my<lb/>situation there became so
                            unpleasant, that I was<lb/>induced, in <date when="1804-01"
                                >January</date> last, to resign my place as an<lb/>inspector. I
                            devoted seven years in endeavouring to<lb/>establish this excellent
                            institution, and am not a<lb/>little mortified, that there is some
                            reason to appre-<lb/>hend all my labours are like to be lost. I
                            have,<lb/>however, the consolation of having the most satisfac-<lb/>tory
                            and pleasing proofs of the marked approbation<lb/>of every officer in
                            our government, and of all my<lb/>friends. Some of the convicts, about
                            three weeks<lb/>since, set fire to the prison, and destroyed the
                            whole<lb/>of the roof of the north wing; it is now repairing,<lb/>and
                            will soon be under cover. This circumstance hap-<lb/>pened, in
                            consequence of neglect in the assistant<lb/>keepers, who have all been

                        <p>I am quite ashamed to discover, on recurring to<lb/>my correspondence on
                            the affairs of philanthropy and<lb/>humanity, that I have been so long
                            your debtor for<lb/>a reply to your favour of the <date

                                Sep-<lb/>tember</date> following; since which period, even
                            until<lb/> this hour, my time has been so constantly occu-<lb/>pied, by
                            a necessary attention to a great variety<lb/>of public business as a

                            time for those pur-<lb/>suits, to which I am so much inclined to direct
                            my<lb/>attention. This circumstance, however, has not<lb/>prevented me
                            from establishing two schools in the<lb/>city of <placeName key="westm1"
                                >Westminster</placeName>, where I reside; the one for 200<lb/>boys,
                            who, with the assistance of monitors, selected<lb/>from the most acute
                            of the pupils, act as ushers under<lb/><emph rend="italic">one

                        <p>Inclosed I send you one of the proof sheets con-<lb/>taining an account
                            of our proceedings, by which you<lb/>will perceive the vast disparity on
                            the score of<lb/>expense, between the new and old method of
                            com-<lb/>municating appropriate instruction to the lower<lb/>classes of
                            the people. I likewise send you one of<lb/>my reports, which were
                            circulated early in the pre-<lb/>sent year, which procured us, as you
                            will observe,<lb/><pb n="209" facs="SW_TE1834_206"/>the countenance and support of the first

                        <p><persName key="jlanc1">Mr. Lancaster</persName> has received from me

                            the result has been, that many of our philan-<lb/>thropists, as well as

                            in the way<lb/>of the due and proper execution of every

                        <p>I am very much concerned, (from your letter of the<lb/><date

                            and also those of the same spirit of<lb/>benevolent research in Great

                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>I am much obliged to you for the reports sent me<lb/>by <persName
                                key="cmatl1">Captain Matlack</persName>, which I hope to receive in
                            a few<lb/>days. I have in readiness to be sent you, a series
                            of<lb/>reports, published by our Society for bettering the<lb/>condition
                            of the Poor, since the last that I forwarded;<lb/>and it is my intention
                            to send you the succeeding<lb/>numbers, as they are published; also the
                            reports of a<lb/>very active society for the suppression of vice,
                            which<lb/>was instituted in this metropolis about three years<lb/>ago,
                            and which has been productive of a great deal<lb/>of good, in disclosing
                            and bringing to punishment<lb/>the perpetrators of acts of debauchery
                            and wicked-<lb/>ness, which, from the degree of turpitude annexed
                            to<lb/>it, almost exceeds credibility. Such are the evils<lb/>which
                            affect large societies, that it requires the con-<lb/>stant and watchful
                            eye of the <emph rend="italic">moralist</emph> and the<lb/><emph
                                rend="italic">philanthropist</emph>, to keep them in check. You are
                            hap-<lb/>pily free as yet from many of these evils; and an<lb/>attention
                            to the education of youth will be the only<lb/>means of prevention;
                            since, in the course of time, large<lb/>cities will arise in America,
                            and a population equal<lb/>to all Europe will cover its forests in less
                            than a<lb/>century.</p>
                        <p>I am much gratified to find that my remarks on<lb/>public education and
                            preventive police met your<lb/>approbation. Notwithstanding the
                            unexampled be-<lb/>nevolence and munificence which pervades
                            this<lb/>country, the interruptions we experience in obtaining<lb/>wise
                            and salutary laws, in consequence of the wars<lb/>in which we are
                            unhappily involved, is very great.<lb/>This excessive calamity obstructs
                            the adoption of<lb/>many wise and salutary regulations, which the
                            state<lb/><pb n="211" facs="SW_TE1834_208"/>of society imperiously calls for. I have
                            circulated<lb/>your excellent work on prisons among the very
                            first<lb/>and most elevated characters in this country and
                                in<lb/><placeName key="irel">Ireland</placeName>, and I yet indulge
                            a hope, that in the course<lb/>of Providence we may enjoy the blessings
                            of peace,<lb/>when an opportunity will be offered, ere long,
                            to<lb/>follow the good example that is set before us. Your<lb/>mode of
                            correction by solitary confinement, under<lb/>certain regulations, is
                            excellent; and the result of<lb/> the various experiments which have
                            been made,<lb/>prove it to be wise and salutary, and that the
                            measure<lb/>did not proceed from visionary or enthusiastic
                            ideas.<lb/>Where punishment produces amendment, and restores<lb/>
                            offenders again to society, renovated and reformed; and<lb/>where this
                            great desideratum can be obtained, with-<lb/>out expense to a nation or
                            to individuals, it may be<lb/>truly affirmed, that this great and
                            important branch<lb/>of criminal police has arrived at the greatest
                            height<lb/>of perfection of which human institutions are
                            sus-<lb/>ceptible: but the misfortune is, that in the affairs<lb/>of
                            society, every thing depends on the <emph rend="italic">purity</emph>,
                            the <emph rend="italic">dis-<lb/>cretion</emph>, <emph rend="italic"
                                >abilities</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">zeal</emph>, of those who
                            conduct public<lb/>institutions. In good hands they flourish;
                            while<lb/>under a less careful, zealous, and intelligent
                            manage-<lb/>ment, they retrograde and decay. It is to a diversity<lb/>of
                            opinion, often among well intentioned men, who<lb/>do not well consider
                            the subject, or whose judgments<lb/>are deficient, or their passions
                            predominant, that<lb/>many excellent institutions are imperfect in
                            their<lb/>first concoction, and under these disadvantages,
                            coupled<lb/>with want of intelligence and zeal in the manage-<lb/>ment,
                            do not succeed. I am happy to hear so good<lb/>an account of the
                            penitentiary house in <placeName key="newje">New Jersey</placeName>.
                            <lb/>That of <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> is well
                            known from the various<lb/>accounts which have been given of this
                            excellent<lb/> institution, and it is indeed much to be
                            lamented,<lb/>that the spirit of party should extend its
                            influence,<lb/>so as to disturb the economy of those
                            establishments,<lb/>which have been instituted for the general benefit
                            <lb/><pb n="212" facs="SW_TE1834_209"/>of the community at large. Where any public
                            con-<lb/>cern in the minor regulations of the state is going
                            on<lb/>well, changes constantly produce evil; and although<lb/>men of
                            equal talents and integrity supplant those<lb/>that have been heretofore
                            in the management of<lb/>gratuitous undertakings, the deficiency of
                            knowledge<lb/>and experience never fail to generate evils, and
                            to<lb/>check the progress of improvement.</p>
                        <p>It is a pleasing circumstance to hear, that peni-<lb/>tentiary houses
                            have been established in <placeName key="virgi"
                            >Virginia</placeName><lb/>and in <placeName key="boston"
                                >Boston</placeName>. Various circumstances lead me to<lb/>expect
                            that the latter will be well managed. When-<lb/>ever political influence
                            is interposed in the appoint-<lb/>ment of officers or managers, it
                            rarely happens that<lb/>the best selection is made.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly true, that many actual criminals<lb/>escape punishment in
                            Great Britain, and many reign<lb/>for a number of years, and continue in
                            the pursuit<lb/>of crimes by which they support themselves,
                            before<lb/>the public justice of the country can be made to<lb/>attach
                            to them; and it is also true, that in America,<lb/>from the peculiar
                            state of society, crimes by being<lb/>easier detected and proved, allow
                            very few culprits<lb/>to escape. But this apparent difficulty of
                            conviction<lb/>is chiefly confined to this metropolis, and to the
                            popu-<lb/>lous towns in different parts of the kingdom.
                                In<lb/><placeName key="scot">Scotland</placeName>, however, which
                            does not contain one third<lb/>of the population of America, it is
                            somewhat similar<lb/>to your country, and I am inclined to believe,
                            except-<lb/>ing in its capital, and two or three large towns,
                            that<lb/>very few who are guilty escape detection and pun-<lb/>ishment.
                            The limited number of crimes in that<lb/> country, is to be attributed
                            chiefly to the attention<lb/>heretofore paid to the religious and moral
                            education<lb/>of the inferior orders of society. I am sorry,
                            however,<lb/>to learn from persons of intelligence in that
                            country,<lb/>that the progress of wealth, arising from
                            productive<lb/>industry, and the extension of manufactures,
                            has<lb/>produced changes not favourable to the morals of the<lb/><pb
                                n="213" facs="SW_TE1834_210"/>people, which, of course, will have the effect to
                            generate<lb/>crimes. Such is the evil consequences of natural<lb/>wealth
                            suddenly acquired, that it is always counter-<lb/>balanced by evils in
                            the opposite scale.</p>
                        <p>What you have most of all to dread in America, as<lb/>a general corrupter
                            of morals, is the want of a due<lb/>control on public houses and liquor
                            shops, in your<lb/>bung-hole towns. Until publicans of all
                            descriptions<lb/>are licensed, and put under strict regulations,
                            the<lb/>abuses through this medium will increase, and pro-<lb/>duce
                            excessive evils, which will be almost without a<lb/>remedy, if not
                            prevented in due time.</p>
                        <p>The prohibition of distillation can never be expect-<lb/>ed in any
                            country, and therefore all we can hope for,<lb/><emph rend="italic">is a
                                strong control over those who deal it out to the pro-<lb/>fligate
                                and the idle</emph>, and to those who are influenced<lb/>by their
                            example.</p>
                        <p>At the commencement of the last year, I published<lb/>a tract on the duty
                            of a constable, which I first meant<lb/>for the instruction of those in
                                <placeName key="westm1">Westminster</placeName>; but<lb/>in the

                            induced to snatch an occasional<lb/>hour from public business, and to
                            extend it so as to<lb/>apply to all England. In the appendix to this

                            <salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p> Since I had the pleasure of receiving thy much<lb/>esteemed favour of
                                <date when="1804-08-08">8th of August</date> in the last year,
                            I<lb/> have been several times absent on distant journeys,<lb/>and have
                            not enjoyed my health equal to former<lb/>years, but this is not
                            sufficient to excuse my very<lb/>great neglect, and particularly in not
                            acknowledging<lb/>the receipt of thy very acceptable parcel of books
                            by<lb/>the Alexander, for which be pleased accept my sin-<lb/>cere
                            thanks. I repeatedly intended writing by dif-<lb/>ferent ships that
                            sailed from <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, but
                            unac-<lb/>countably put it off from one opportunity to another,<lb/>and
                            now not being able to justify my neglect, I have<lb/>only to crave thy
                            indulgence in excusing it.</p>
                        <p>The pamphlet on guineas, &amp;c., by <persName key="hbone1">Henry
                                Boner</persName>,<lb/>Esq., afforded me much entertainment and
                            useful<lb/>information. The subject of paper credit is
                            highly<lb/>interesting, and particularly so to us on this side
                            the<lb/>Atlantic, where paper currency is largely emited by<lb/>a great
                            number of banks, spread over almost every<lb/>state in the union. The
                            solidity of these establish-<lb/>ments are rendered exceedingly
                            hazardous, by dis-<lb/>counting mostly what is termed
                            accommodation<lb/>notes, which are renewed and continued at the end<lb/>
                            of sixty days, and go on year after year. The bank<lb/>notes issued of
                            course must be very considerable,<lb/>without any thing solid to
                            represent them, except<lb/>the credit of the names of the drawer and
                            endorser.<lb/><pb n="215" facs="SW_TE1834_212"/>In my apprehension, the business of banks
                            should be<lb/>confined to discounting what is termed business<lb/>notes,
                            except only under some peculiar circumstances,<lb/>otherways the credit
                            of the banks is liable to be<lb/>materially injured.</p>
                        <p>I am not well acquainted with the affairs of our<lb/>Prison, since myself
                            and colleagues resigned our<lb/> places. The present inspectors, in my
                            opinion, are<lb/>not so suitable characters for the government of
                            that<lb/>institution, as might have been selected amongst
                            our<lb/>citizens; the mode of treating the prisoners is in<lb/> some
                            respects more severe than was thought neces-<lb/>sary by the former
                            board of inspectors, and the profits<lb/>on the labour of the convicts
                            are considerably short of<lb/>what was produced the year ending <date
                                when="1803-07-01">1st July 1803</date>.<lb/>Cleanliness and good
                            order throughout the prison, is<lb/>perhaps as well observed as
                            formerly, and notwith-<lb/>standing the increased expense for supporting
                            the<lb/>prison, the legislature remains firmly attached to
                            our<lb/>present criminal code, and I trust it will continue
                            an<lb/>ornament to our country, and serve as an example<lb/>to other
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>The excellent sentiments contained in thy several<lb/>letters and the
                            pamphlets thou so kindly sent me, has<lb/>so interested me in the
                            subject of affording a suitable<lb/>education to the children of the
                            poor, that I have been<lb/>much engaged in a new establishment for
                            schooling<lb/>poor children, who are not provided for by
                            any<lb/>religious society. Our state legislature have passed<lb/>an act
                            incorporating this society; the mayor of the<lb/>city is president, and
                            the public appear much inte-<lb/>rested in its support. I trust the poor
                            will derive<lb/>great benefit by means of it, and we expect
                            next<lb/>winter our legislature will provide sufficient funds<lb/>for
                            supporting it. It must afford great pleasure to<lb/>every feeling mind,
                            that the plan of affording reli-<lb/>gious and moral instruction to the
                            poor of your<lb/>country, has so much engaged the attention of
                            so<lb/>great a number of highly respectable characters, and<lb/><pb
                                n="216" facs="SW_TE1834_213"/>I sincerely hope the time is not very far distant,<lb/>when
                            you will have the countenance and assistance<lb/>of your government in
                            improving your poor laws,<lb/>which undoubtedly have hitherto tended to

                            city.</p>
                        <p>I should be much gratified, if thou wouldst be so<lb/>good as to inform
                            me of the present state of the school<lb/>under the care of <persName

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I have postponed acknowledging the receipt of<lb/>your acceptable favour,
                            of the <date when="1805-09-09">9th September</date>, last<lb/>year, from
                            month to month, in hopes of being able to<lb/>make such communications
                            on the subject of political<lb/>economy, as I conceived ought to be
                            acceptable; but<lb/>my public duties have become so multifarious, as
                            to<lb/>afford me less time than I could wish, although I
                            can<lb/>conscientiously say, that I do not waste a moment in<lb/>any
                            pursuit that has not public or private utility for<lb/>its object. The
                            banking system, if conducted on<lb/>a proper principle, has certainly a
                            great tendency to<lb/>give efficacy and extension to human labour,
                            which,<lb/>you well know, is the only source of wealth in every<lb/>
                            country; and, perhaps, no nation upon earth has<lb/>been more indebted
                            to the powerful effect of credit<lb/>and confidence than this, in giving
                            a spring to the<lb/>industry and enterprise of the people, and
                            thereby<lb/> rendering every species of human labour extremely<lb/><pb
                                n="217" facs="SW_TE1834_214"/> productive. I have been turning my thoughts a
                            good<lb/>deal of late to this interesting branch of
                            political<lb/>economy, as it relates to the effect produced in
                            Great<lb/>Britain, through this medium, and the result of my<lb/>
                            researches have perfectly astonished me. Seeing<lb/>that the rapid
                            increase of our taxes, and the enor-<lb/>mous public expense, occasioned
                            by the war, did not<lb/>appear to diminish, in the smallest degree, the
                            splen-<lb/>dour of living, or the general comfort of the people,<lb/>I
                            was induced to search for the causes which pro-<lb/>duced what appeared
                            to me to be a very extraordi-<lb/>nary phenomenon, namely, the <emph
                                rend="italic">sources from whence<lb/>have sprung those forty
                                millions</emph>, for the purposes of<lb/>the state, and <emph
                                rend="italic">five millions</emph> and upwards, for the
                            sup-<lb/>port of the poor, and other purposes, and to leave<lb/>behind a
                            surplus sufficient to enable so considerable<lb/>a proportion of our
                            population to live in ease and<lb/>affluence. I was apprehensive all was
                            not sound,<lb/>because, in order to support this expense, a new
                            pro-<lb/>perty from <emph rend="italic">labour</emph> must be created
                            yearly; and, the<lb/>question to be solved was this, in what
                            manner,<lb/>and by what means is it exacted?—I found after<lb/>much
                            research, that it arose <emph rend="italic">solely from six
                                branches<lb/>of industry</emph>, and that these, upon a full
                            investigation<lb/>of the subject, upon which I recently occupied
                            myself<lb/> without intermission, for four weeks, secluded in
                            the<lb/>country, amounted to the enormous sum of 222,000,000<lb/><emph

                            a<lb/>height beyond all belief, while the bowels of the<lb/>earth yield
                            a very large sum annually, from mines<lb/>and minerals. Our

                            millions, on a population of 5,500,000 persons;<lb/>now, it is estimated

                            increase with the opulence of the country.</p>
                        <p>Our poor, either wholly or partially, maintained at<lb/>the public

                            to them alone,<lb/>is somewhat more than 4,700,000<emph rend="italic"
                                >l</emph>. a year, which ex-<lb/>ceeds the whole revenue of most of

                            than that of <placeName key="denm">Denmark</placeName> and <placeName

                            country, and to contri-<lb/>bute to its happiness and prosperity, I have
                            publish-<lb/>ed, this last Summer, a tract on the education of
                            the<lb/>poor, which I send you, under cover. I know you<lb/>will read it
                            with avidity, because it is not only a<lb/>subject in which you have, on
                            all occasions, very<lb/>much interested yourself, but because it is
                            treated in<lb/>a manner somewhat new, while it contains many<lb/>strong
                            points, calculated not only to excite attention,<lb/> but, I trust, to
                            be useful in America, and in every<lb/>civilized country. I am, at
                            present, engaged in com-<lb/>piling another work on the subject of the
                            poor, which<lb/>is also treated in a manner different from other
                            au-<lb/>thors who have written on the subject. I hope, in a<lb/>couple
                            of months, to present it to the public, when I<lb/><pb n="220" facs="SW_TE1834_217"/>shall
                            not fail to send you a copy; and, I trust, it<lb/>may be found to
                            contain matter applicable to Ame-<lb/>rica, where the morals in vulgar
                            life are so assimi-<lb/>lated to those of <placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName>, that the same remedies<lb/>will apply in both
                            countries. You will see, however,<lb/>in the treatise on education, that
                            I have given some<lb/>details, relative to the criminality of the
                            country,<lb/> which I have enlarged upon in the treatise on
                            indi-<lb/>gence, which now occupies my attention. The war<lb/>eases us
                            of many idle and dissolute characters, who<lb/>find employment in the
                            army and navy; yet, the<lb/>calendar of delinquency greatly exceeds what
                            could<lb/>be wished, and much remains to be done to counter-<lb/>act the
                            evils which opulence produces in society,<lb/> joined to a want of
                            proper attention to the religious<lb/>and moral instruction of the poor.
                            You will see,<lb/>from the subject of this letter, that it is only
                            meant<lb/>for your own eye, or that of your private friends.<lb/> I
                            shall soon write you again, and send you the report,<lb/>published last
                            year, by our society for bettering the<lb/>condition of the poor. I fear
                            nothing but legislative<lb/>measures, adapted to the present state of
                            society, will<lb/>produce that general amelioration, which is so
                            much<lb/> wanted.</p>

                            have been able<lb/>to arrange matters, so as to be able to retire
                            with<lb/>my family for a few weeks during the summer sea-<lb/>son to
                            some part of the country near the sea; and in<lb/>this seclusion, I
                            generally devote my time to that<lb/>species of business which my
                            numerous public duties<lb/>in the metropolis oblige me to postpone. I
                            have,<lb/>therefore, brought to this retired picturesque country<lb/>all
                            my unavoidably postponed letters; and among<lb/>the rest, your two
                            favours above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It cannot fail to afford me the most heartfelt satis-<lb/>faction to
                            learn, that the works I send you on <emph rend="italic"

                            society in<lb/>America, and of diffusing comfort and happiness<lb/>among
                            the <emph rend="italic">inferior orders</emph> in the United States,
                            who<lb/>constitute the mass of the people in all nations.
                            A<lb/>disposition certainly exists in this country, to adopt<lb/>many of
                            the public measures I have recommended;<lb/>but I have written at an
                            era, when in the rapid<lb/>succession of the most extraordinary events,

                            which appeared to become more and more<lb/>imminent, all considerations

                            French are on land, yet when<lb/>they come in contact with British
                            troops on that<lb/> element, they are compelled (as has been seen
                            almost<lb/>in every instance) to yield the palm to <emph rend="italic"
                                >British valour<lb/>and discipline</emph>. Let us, therefore, hope
                            that <placeName key="engl">England</placeName><lb/>and America will form
                            a permanent union, as the<lb/>best means of preserving the peace of the
                            world, and<lb/>promoting the best interests of the human species.</p>
                        <p>The attainment of this great object now that<lb/><pb n="227" facs="SW_TE1834_224"/>men's minds
                            are becoming more enlightened, would<lb/>open an extensive field among
                            the higher ranks of<lb/>society, for diffusing those blessings which
                            would be<lb/> conferred upon mankind by <emph rend="italic">good
                                laws</emph>, and useful<lb/>regulations in civil polity. Much as has
                            been done,<lb/>it is yet but little in comparison to what is
                            still<lb/>required to complete this great work. I would wil-<lb/>lingly
                            flatter myself, when the happy period of peace<lb/>arrives, that the
                            improvements will not be confined<lb/>to the British dominions, but will
                            extend over all<lb/>Europe, and the civilized world.</p>
                        <p>The lower orders of the people, from whose labour<lb/>we derive all that
                            we possess, have never been<lb/> proper objects of attention in any
                            country. Much<lb/>might be done to render them better subjects
                            and<lb/>citizens—to extend to them greater comforts, by a<lb/>stronger
                            sense of religious and moral duties; and to<lb/>add much to the means of
                            subsisting themselves and<lb/>families in a better manner. The wise and
                            benevo-<lb/>lent rulers and statesmen in every country, have much<lb/>in
                            their power in this respect; whereby a nation<lb/>may be rendered happy
                            and contented with its<lb/>government, indisposed to changes and
                            revolutions,<lb/> and prone by industry and sober habits to add to
                            the<lb/>state of national happiness. Perhaps, at no period<lb/>in the
                            history of this country, has there existed so<lb/>great a disposition
                            among the well educated ranks<lb/>to promote these benevolent views. But
                                <emph rend="italic">war—fatal<lb/>war</emph>—checks the progress of
                            every thing that is good.<lb/>Let me hope so great a calamity will never
                            afflict<lb/>the United States. The efforts of individuals are<lb/>useful
                            in promoting all benevolent purposes: but the<lb/>aid and countenance of
                            the State is necessary, to give<lb/>permanency and consistency to all
                            measures tending<lb/>to ameliorate the condition of the labouring
                            people;<lb/>and to check, where it is necessary, the zeal of
                            indi-<lb/>viduals, when not accompanied by good judgment.<lb/>Hence the
                            immense sums bequeathed in <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>
                            for<lb/>benevolent purposes, under circumstances often so<lb/><pb

                        <p>The bill brought in to the Commons' House of Par-<lb/>liament, for the

                            was lost in the house of lords.<lb/>The system proposed had by no means
                            the approba-<lb/>tion of many respectable persons, who had
                            bestowed<lb/>much time in considering the subject; but when<lb/>peace is
                            restored, the question will no doubt be again<lb/>agitated—or perhaps
                            sooner.</p>
                        <p>On the <date when="1808-07-26">twenty-sixth July</date>, I wrote you a

                            con-<lb/>dition of the poor which have been published since <lb/><pb
                                n="229" facs="SW_TE1834_226"/>the former series of reports were sent you. I shall<lb/>be
                            glad to hear that they have reached you in safety.<lb/>Soon after, I
                            retired with my family for a couple of<lb/>months for the benefit of
                            sea-bathing, several of them<lb/>having enjoyed bad health for a
                            considerable length<lb/>of time, and 1 found a little relaxation
                            necessary for<lb/>myself, in consequence of the fatigues of
                            business.<lb/>I brought as usual with me, your letters, with
                            many<lb/>others, which the pressure of public business in town<lb/>would
                            not permit me to attend to; and these, with<lb/>my daily correspondents
                            on official and other busi-<lb/>ness, joined to some important state
                            papers, which<lb/>required to be drawn up by me with that degree
                            of<lb/>attention which could be best done in solitude, has<lb/>kept me
                            constantly employed. I am happy to say,<lb/>that my family are
                            considerably improved in health,<lb/>and I feel myself better of the

                            sixty-fourth year,<lb/> and not enjoying very good health.</p>

                            other letters which did not require an immedi-<lb/>ate reply, and having

                            prevented from<lb/> referring to it, and under the pressure of other
                            affairs<lb/>it totally escaped me; but 1 have now taken

                            calling upon her, and shall rejoice to have it in my<lb/>power to render
                            her any acceptable services, either<lb/>by my advice or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of the Brantingham Tract, I have<lb/>addressed a separate

                            me additional satisfac-<lb/>tion to believe, that as life advances, and
                            its close<lb/> approaches, thy solicitude for the welfare of thy
                            fel-<lb/>low creatures, and a preparation for thy own final<lb/>well
                            being, is more and more ardent and impressive.<lb/>A little longer
                            period will manifest to us both, the<lb/> infinite importance of this
                            solicitude and preparation.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to perceive by thy letter, that many<lb/>of you at
                                <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, are deeply interested
                            in pro-<lb/>moting the recovery and relief of insane persons; and<lb/>I
                            hope you will be encouraged in the pursuit of this<lb/>benevolent and
                            good work.</p>
                        <p>I did not know how I could better answer thy<lb/>views and wishes,
                            respecting your proposed asylum,<lb/>than by putting thy pamphlet and
                            letter into the<lb/> hands of my benevolent and zealous friend,
                                <persName key="stuke1">Samuel<lb/>Tuke</persName>, who has paid
                            great attention to this subject;<lb/>and I am gratified with introducing
                            you to the<lb/>acquaintance of each other.</p>
                        <p>Thy request to me respecting the plan for an asy-<lb/>lum, came very
                            seasonably. The magistrates for the<lb/>West Riding of <placeName
                                key="yorks">Yorkshire</placeName>, intending to erect an
                            insti-<lb/>tution for pauper lunatics, advertised for plans,
                            and<lb/>gave out correspondent instructions. The result was,<lb/>the
                            production of a great number and variety of<lb/>plans. That one which
                            obtained the preference and<lb/>the highest premium, thou will find
                            delineated in<lb/>the <q>Practical Hints</q> of <persName key="stuke1"
                                >Samuel Tuke</persName>, which I send<lb/>to thee with this letter.
                            This pamphlet was very<lb/>lately published, and was composed by him, to
                            satisfy<lb/>the justices on several important points; and I
                            believe<lb/>it received their warm approbation. The work will,<lb/> I
                            doubt not, be very gratifying to thee. Thou will<lb/>perceive that, in
                            order to adapt the plan to your<lb/>views at <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>, he has introduced into it some <lb/><pb n="232" facs="SW_TE1834_229"/>modifications. On the whole, I venture to presume,<lb/>that the
                                <q>Practical Hints,</q> the letter of my friend<lb/><persName
                                key="stuke1">Samuel Tuke</persName> to thee, and the modified plan
                            of the<lb/>intended Wakefield Asylum, will very materially<lb/>assist
                            you in adopting such a building and establish-<lb/>ment, as will answer
                            the end you have in view.</p>
                        <p>I have pleasure in being the instrument of convey-<lb/>ing to thee these

                        <p>Inclosed is the copy of a letter, addressed by me<lb/>to <persName
                                key="bblee1">Barent Bleecker</persName>, of <placeName key="alban"

                            of this letter, and if, in thy<lb/>opinion, it would be advisable for
                            the Board of Direc-<lb/>tors of our Canal Company to offer a memorial
                            to<lb/>the legislature, embracing the several matters con-<lb/>tained in

                            me.</p>
                        <p>Thou wilt recollect that, when I had the pleasure<lb/>of seeing thee at
                                <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, we agreed, that it

                            our<lb/> friend, <persName key="shunt1">Samuel Huntington</persName>, as
                            soon as in thy power.<lb/>I have left the letter open for thy perusal,

                            equally<lb/>interested in the subject alluded to in the

                        <p>I have had considerable conversation with our<lb/>mutual friend,
                                <persName key="jcolt1">Judah Colt</persName>, Esq. of the town of
                                <placeName key="erie">Erie</placeName>,<lb/>on the subject of the
                            proposed <geogName key="eriec">Canal</geogName> from <geogName
                                key="lakee">Erie</geogName> to<lb/>the <geogName key="hudsr"
                                >Hudson</geogName>, and being extremely desirous of know-<lb/>ing
                            the sentiments of the citizens of your State rela-<lb/>ting to a plan,
                            that appears to me, so interesting to<lb/>you as well as to us, I take
                            the liberty, in conformity<lb/>to the recommendation of my friend
                                <persName key="jcolt1">Colt</persName>, to crave of<lb/>thee, to
                            give me such information as may be in thy<lb/>power. I have been, for
                            twenty years, a Director in<lb/>the West Inland Canal Company of this
                            State, and<lb/>have frequently visited our western country; and
                            as<lb/>one of the Commissioners appointed by our legisla-<lb/>ture, for
                            the consideration of all matters relating to<lb/>the improvement of the
                            internal navigation of the<lb/>State, I explored in company with the
                            said Com-<lb/>missioners all our western waters, as far as <placeName
                                key="lakee">Lake<lb/>Erie</placeName>. I mention these
                            circumstances, merely to<lb/>account for the zeal I may discover, in
                            wishing to<lb/>promote an object of the highest importance,
                            and<lb/>incalculable value, as it regards the state of <placeName
                                key="newyo">New<lb/>York</placeName>, and most of the other States
                            in the Union.<lb/>No person who has sufficiently reflected on the
                            sub-<lb/>ject, would hesitate one moment on account of the<lb/>cost, as
                            it is a well known fact, that the resources of<lb/>this State alone, are
                            fully equal to the undertaking.<lb/>During the late war, the subject of
                            course did not<lb/>command much public attention, but since we
                            have<lb/>enjoyed the blessings of peace, the minds of most of<lb/>our
                            citizens appear to be anxious to have it accom-<lb/>plished. Still we
                            shall have many difficulties to en-<lb/>counter—with the timid, who are
                            afraid of the expense<lb/>—and the ignorant, who are incapable of
                            apprecia-<lb/>ting its importance and advantages. I have lately<lb/>
                            received a letter from a gentleman, who resides on the<lb/><geogName
                                key="alleg">Allegany River</geogName> in this State, who states he

                            to take a very<lb/>decided part in favour of promoting the
                            contemplated<lb/> connexion of the waters of <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogName> with the <geogName key="hudsr">Hud-<lb/>son
                                River</geogName>; and he adds, that many persons expressed<lb/>an
                            anxious desire, that your legislature should make<lb/>a communication to
                            our legislature on the subject,<lb/>stating the great advantages that
                            would be afforded<lb/>to the State of <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName>, if this grand project was<lb/>once accommplished.
                            On this I crave to remark, and<lb/>beg thy particular attention. If your
                            legislature<lb/>could be induced to make such a communication,<lb/>there
                            is not the least doubt to be entertained, but<lb/>that it would have so
                            much weight with our legis-<lb/>lature, as to induce them immediately to
                            commence<lb/>the work. It is true, the commissioners, as well<lb/>as
                            others, have endeavoured to make the legislature<lb/>understand, that
                            the <geogName key="eriec">Canal</geogName> of course would draw<lb/>
                            your trade to <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>, but owing to
                            a want of<lb/>knowledge of the geography of the country, they
                            are,<lb/>many of them, incapable of forming a correct judg-<lb/>ment on
                            the subject. It will then be readily con-<lb/>ceived, how much it might
                            enlighten their minds,<lb/>and influence their judgments, if a suitable
                            commu-<lb/>nication was made in the manner before mentioned.<lb/>I beg
                            leave to refer this part of the subject to thy<lb/>serious attention,
                            and possibly it may correspond<lb/>with thy views, to use thy influence,
                            and unite it<lb/>with other influential characters in your State,
                            to<lb/>introduce it before your legislature. Our sessions<lb/>commence
                            at <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> in <date when="1816-01"
                                >January</date>. Congress have<lb/>large tracts of land in your
                            State—suppose your<lb/>legislature should apply for a grant of a portion
                            of<lb/> land, expressly for the purpose of promoting the
                            com-<lb/>pletion of the <geogName key="eriec">Canal</geogName>, and then
                            you were to offer it to<lb/>the legislature of <placeName key="newyo"
                                >New York</placeName>, on condition that the citi-<lb/>zens and
                            produce of the State of <placeName key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>, should
                            pass<lb/>through the <geogName key="eriec">Canal</geogName> and Locks
                            without paying toll.<lb/>This is offered as a hint for your examination;
                            you<lb/>are more capable of judging as to the mode and man-<lb/>
                            <pb n="236" facs="SW_TE1834_233"/>ner of making the communication. I will add, that<lb/>if it
                            should he concluded, that such a communication<lb/>ought to be made, it
                            would have an incalculable good<lb/>effect, if it could be presented to
                            our legislature<lb/>about the time that the Commissioners offer
                            their<lb/>annual report. This may be done, if your legisla-<lb/>ture
                            meets in <date when="1816-01">January</date>, as I am informed it
                            will.</p>
                        <p>I send by the mail, two copies of our reports to<lb/>the legislature, and

                            <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I was favoured, about ten days ago, with your<lb/>letter of the <date
                                when="1815-11-28">28th ultimo</date>, enclosing the copy of
                            one<lb/>from you, of a prior date, to Mr. <persName key="bblee1">Barent
                                Bleecker</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The shortness of the days, and the pressure of my<lb/>agency business,
                            with some other circumstances, not<lb/>necessary to be mentioned, have
                            prevented me from<lb/>returning you an earlier answer.</p>
                        <p>As yet, I have received no communication from<lb/>Mr. <persName
                                key="bwrig1">Wright</persName>, on the subject of the memorial,
                            which<lb/>he was to set on foot, at <placeName key="rome"
                                >Rome</placeName>, and other places.</p>
                        <p>Last week there was a meeting of the Directors<lb/>of the Seneca Canal
                            Company, in this village; and<lb/>I embraced the opportunity, which the
                            meeting<lb/>afforded, of consulting the Directors on the
                            expediency<lb/>of the proposed <geogName key="eriec">Canal</geogName>,
                            from <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName> to <placeName key="salin"
                                >Salina</placeName>. I found<lb/>them unanimously of opinion, that
                            the measure was<lb/>well calculated to improve the navigation—that
                            it<lb/>ought to be zealously pursued—and that they
                            would<lb/>individually contribute their best endeavours to pro-<lb/>mote
                            its success.</p>
                        <p>The work of canalling the <geogName key="senef">Seneca Falls</geogName>,
                            is pro-<lb/>gressing with every prospect of being completed by <lb/><pb
                                n="237" facs="SW_TE1834_234"/><date when="1816-10">next October</date>, if sufficient
                            additional funds can be<lb/>procured for the purpose. The contractor for
                            the<lb/> work is a <persName key="mlewi1">Mr. Marshal Lewis</persName>;
                            this gentleman seems<lb/>to unite rare talents, with uncommon
                            application,<lb/>and exemplary integrity; and he has thus
                            far<lb/>brought forward the work in a style supposed to<lb/>surpass, as
                            well in durability as in appearance, any<lb/>canal work in the United
                            States. This fortunate<lb/> result, however, is in great part to be
                            ascribed to a<lb/>species of stone, discovered by <persName key="mlewi1"
                                >Mr. Lewis</persName>, at the head<lb/>of the <geogName key="senec"
                                >Seneca Lake</geogName>; which is taken from the quarry<lb/>in large
                            masses, is of a blueish colour, and though of<lb/>solid texture, yet it
                            is sufficiently soft to yield, with<lb/>ease, to the stroke of the
                            hammer. <persName key="mlewi1">Mr. Lewis</persName> has<lb/>gone so far
                            beyond his contract, in the good quality<lb/>of his work, that the sum
                            he is to receive will fall<lb/>near ten thousand dollars short of what
                            is requisite<lb/>to finish it; to supply which deficiency the
                            Directors<lb/>intend to apply to the liberality of the legislature.</p>
                        <p>All our accounts from the settlers in the neigh-<lb/>bourhood of
                                <geogName key="lakeo">Lake Ontario</geogName>, and from the traders
                            re-<lb/>siding within our territory, but doing more or less<lb/>business
                            in <placeName key="montr">Montreal</placeName>, agree that the British
                            have their<lb/>eyes wide open, to the importance of the trade
                            of<lb/>this country, and are adopting measures to secure it.<lb/>Among
                            other means, they have put in train the build-<lb/>ing of steam boats on
                            the <geogName key="lakeo">Lake</geogName>, to carry freight to<lb/>and
                            from <placeName key="fwell">Fort Wellington</placeName>, late <placeName
                                key="presc">Prescott</placeName>; and they<lb/>are, moreover,
                            contemplating the improvement of the<lb/>navigation of the <geogName
                                key="stlar">St. Lawrence</geogName>, by canalling the<lb/>rapids;
                            which, it is said, will not be a very difficult<lb/>undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Such being the policy of the British, it behooves<lb/>our state to wake
                            from its slumber—to be active,<lb/>and to strain every sinew of its
                            ability, to counter-<lb/>act it. I need not observe, on the almost
                            wonderful<lb/>increase of wealth, which the state would derive<lb/>from
                            a constant and uninterrupted flow of the pro-<lb/>ducts of this large
                            and fertile district, into the cities <lb/><pb n="238" facs="SW_TE1834_235"/>of <placeName
                                key="alban">Albany</placeName> and <placeName key="nycit"
                                >New-York</placeName>. The very idea of part-<lb/>ing with this
                            wealth, by suffering the products to<lb/>be carried to <placeName
                                key="montr">Montreal</placeName>, there to nourish and
                            fatten<lb/>the commerce of a rival nation, cannot fail to excite<lb/>
                            painful reflections in the minds of every man whose<lb/>heart is warmed
                            with the love of country. I say,<lb/>that the state ought to strain
                            every nerve of its ability,<lb/>to counteract the policy of the British,
                            because the<lb/> magnitude of the object utterly forbids all hope
                            of<lb/>accomplishing it by the money contributions
                            of<lb/>individuals</p>
                        <p>What renders it more imperiously the duty of the<lb/>state to interpose
                            with its ability, is the absolute neces-<lb/>sity of regulating the
                            rates of toll by a scale so mode-<lb/>rate, as to make the expense of
                            transportation to <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName><lb/>palpably
                            less than the expense of transportation to<lb/><placeName key="montr"
                                >Montreal</placeName>. This is the grand desideratum to be
                            aimed<lb/>at in every scheme for improving the Lake
                            navigation<lb/>between the Lakes and <geogName key="hudsr">Hudson's
                                River</geogName>. If the expense<lb/>of carriage to <placeName
                                key="alban">Albany</placeName> exceeds the expense of car-<lb/>riage
                            to <placeName key="montr">Montreal</placeName>, the trader will be sure
                            to send his<lb/>produce to the latter only ; and, if the expense
                            be<lb/>equal, he will be apt to do the same, in as much as<lb/>the Lake,
                            and its outlet, form the natural highway<lb/>for conveying the products
                            of this country to an<lb/> Atlantic market, and the use of this highway
                            is at-<lb/>tended with less trouble and risk, and with
                            greater<lb/>despatch. At all times, and under all circumstances,<lb/>it
                            is difficult to change the course of nature, with<lb/> success; and, in
                            the present case, it can only be done<lb/>by giving the trader a deep
                            interest in preferring the<lb/>Eastern to the Northern route.</p>
                        <p> The expense of transporting a barrel of flour from<lb/>this village to
                                <placeName key="montr">Montreal</placeName>, is one dollar and
                            seventy-five<lb/>cents; whereas the expense of transportation
                                to<lb/><placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> is two dollars and
                            fifty cents; and, as long<lb/>as this difference continues, <placeName
                                key="montr">Montreal</placeName> will be likely<lb/>to maintain a
                            successful competition with <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>
                                and<lb/><placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>. </p>

                        <p>You will readily perceive, my dear sir, from what<lb/>has been said, that
                            I place no confidence whatever,<lb/>in the power of any company,
                            incorporated on the<lb/>basis of private credit, to rescue us from the
                            criminal<lb/>act of permitting the British to sever from the body<lb/>of
                            our commerce what may be truly called its right<lb/>arm. I conceive that
                            the stream of our western<lb/> trade can only be forced into the
                                <geogName key="hudsr">Hudson</geogName> by the<lb/>mighty power of
                            our legislature. It is, therefore,<lb/>my clear opinion, that it will be
                            the true policy of<lb/>our company to lay the axe to the root of the
                            evil,<lb/>by going to the legislature with a frank and
                            manly<lb/>memorial, representing the immense value of our<lb/>western
                            trade—the measures which the British ap-<lb/>pear to be contemplating to
                            monopolize it—the high<lb/>importance of defeating those measures—the
                            utter<lb/>impracticability of effecting this great object, by
                            the<lb/>efforts of any incorporated companies, relying on the<lb/>funds
                            and credit of individuals—and praying the<lb/>legislature to put in
                            requisition its vast resources,<lb/>and by exerting them, to save the
                            state from the dis-<lb/>honour and the mischiefs it will incur, by
                            sitting<lb/> with folded arms, and seeing the dismemberment of<lb/>its
                            commerce.</p>
                        <p>I have it in purpose immediately to begin draw-<lb/>ing a memorial to the

                            <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I have been absent a few days, at <placeName key="canan"
                                >Canandai-<lb/>gua</placeName>, which has prevented my attention to
                            the impor-<lb/>tant business of improving our canal navigation.<lb/>Last
                            night we had a meeting of the citizens of this<lb/>village, and we
                            agreed on a petition to the legisla-<lb/>ture, and appointed a committee
                            of correspondence,<lb/>to communicate with the other towns in this
                            county,<lb/>and with the towns in the other counties more
                            im-<lb/>mediately interested in the navigation. I think we<lb/>shall, by
                            our proceedings, put this county in motion.</p>
                        <p>We have just learnt the proceedings in <placeName key="newyo"
                                >New-York</placeName>,<lb/>on the subject of the canal, and are much
                            gratified<lb/>to find they are alive to the importance of another<lb/>
                            application to the legislature.</p>
                        <p>Now is the accepted time—now is the day for adopt-<lb/>ing, and carrying
                            into effect, a policy which is likely<lb/>to be productive of
                            incalculable advantages to the<lb/>commerce of our state.</p>
                        <p>I hope our friends in <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> will also
                            be awaken-<lb/>ed to see their interest, and that our applications
                            to<lb/> the legislature will also be sanctioned with one<lb/>from the
                            great body of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>Our proceedings are in the hands of the printer;<lb/>and as soon as they
                            are published, I will send you a<lb/>copy of them. It may be pleasing to
                            our fellow<lb/>citizens in <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>
                            to see that, in this country,<lb/>we are not unmindful of our duty to
                            them, or to our-<lb/>selves.</p>

                            <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I have been favoured with your letter of the <date when="1816-02-03"
                                >3d<lb/>instant</date>, and I am not a little pleased at
                            learning,<lb/>that our Western Lock Navigation Company, has <lb/><pb
                                n="241" facs="SW_TE1834_238"/>lately so much improved in strength, as, not only
                            to<lb/>walk, but even to run, nearly as fast as any of the<lb/>bank
                            companies; in proof of which, I readily admit<lb/>a declared dividend of
                            eight per cent, for the last<lb/>year, to be very good evidence.</p>
                        <p>We sent our circular letters, with copies of our<lb/>proceedings, to
                                <placeName key="bwrig1">Mr. Wright</placeName>, <persName

                            the <date when="1816-02-06">6th<lb/>instant</date>, I received a letter
                            from <persName key="bwrig1">Mr. Wright</persName>, dated

                                have delayed<lb/>acting; and the memorial from <placeName

                                to<lb/>exertions; and, yesterday, Mr. <persName key="ghunt1">G.

                                of<lb/> meeting the gentlemen there, and conferring on<lb/>this very
                                important subject. Those gentlemen met<lb/>us, and a rough draft of
                                a memorial was drawn<lb/>up, and will be circulated rapidly, and
                                soon be laid<lb/>before the legislature.</said></p>
                        <p>From this extract it appears that <persName key="bwrig1">Mr.

                            until awak-<lb/>ened by the proceedings in <placeName key="nycit">New
                                York</placeName>, and in this<lb/>village.</p>
                        <p>I fear there is too much apathy every where, in<lb/>regard to this great
                            state object; and that I shall be<lb/>disappointed in my expectations of
                            the quantity of<lb/>public opinion that will be carried into the
                            legisla-<lb/>ture. We are collecting the petitions, circulated
                            for<lb/>signature in this neighbourhood, and, in a day or<lb/>two, they
                            will be forwarded to <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>.<lb/>The
                            expense that would attend the appointment<lb/>of a committee to go to
                                <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, and there act
                            as<lb/>lobby members, in favour of the canal, utterly for-<lb/>bids the
                            adoption of such a measure in this county.</p>
                        <p>I think I shall be able to procure the information<lb/><pb n="242" facs="SW_TE1834_239"/>you

                            to you.</p>
                        <p> I cannot express to you, in terms sufficiently strong,<lb/>my grateful
                            feelings for the <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName>
                            memorial.<lb/>Being now in.the number of old men, it is almost<lb/>a
                            matter of course that my opinion should have<lb/>little or no weight;
                            but I assure you, it is my<lb/>solemn belief, that if the legislature
                            should not be<lb/>able to rise so far above the paltry considerations
                            of<lb/>party spirit, and local interests, as to come to a level<lb/>with
                            the magnanimous policy of undertaking the<lb/>canal, as a state work, we
                            may bid adieu to the<lb/>object, and most probably forever!</p>

                            <salute>DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>By direction of the Governors of the <placeName key="newyh">New-York<lb/>
                                Hospital</placeName>, I now send the petition, annual report,
                            and<lb/> annual account of patients admitted and discharged,<lb/>for the
                            year <date when="1815">1815</date>. The House (as customary)
                            will,<lb/>on a motion being made for that purpose, order
                            these<lb/>documents to be printed. The printed account of<lb/>patients
                            will be tedious, and take much time; I<lb/>would, therefore, take the
                            liberty to suggest to thee,<lb/>to direct the printer to serve each
                            member with the<lb/><emph rend="italic">Petition</emph> and <emph
                                rend="italic">Report</emph>, immediately as they are printed.<lb/>I
                            mention this, as it is important to bring the busi-<lb/>ness before the
                            legislature, before other business<lb/>crowd on them.</p>
                        <p>Our cause is a noble one, and I cannot but enter-<lb/>tain full
                            confidence, that our application will be<lb/>favourably received, and
                            acted on with promptness,<lb/><pb n="243" facs="SW_TE1834_240"/>and a spirit of liberality. I
                            believe thou wilt agree<lb/>with me, that we ought not to expect a sum
                            sufficient<lb/>to erect all the necessary buildings (say
                            $70,000)<lb/>would readily be granted us, but I am of opinion<lb/>they
                            would cheerfully allow us $10,000 a year, to be<lb/>paid out of the fund
                            arising out of the sales of goods<lb/>sold at vendue; and, they may more
                            readily do this,<lb/>as the amount from this source, for <date
                                when="1815">1815</date>, will be<lb/><emph rend="italic">very</emph>
                            considerable. A part of this fund is to be paid<lb/>to our corporation
                            for the support of foreign poor,<lb/>some of <emph rend="italic">this
                                part</emph> might possibly be diverted for our<lb/>use, <emph
                                rend="italic">if we cannot otherwise succeed</emph>.</p>
                        <p>If we could complete this establishment, <emph rend="italic">all</emph>
                            the<lb/>insane in the <emph rend="italic">state</emph> might be
                            accommodated; and<lb/>the number at this moment in the several
                            counties<lb/> must be very considerable. If this city contains
                            one<lb/>tenth of the inhabitants of the whole state, and has<lb/>one
                            hundred and twenty lunatics, the number in<lb/>the country must be very
                            great; but, it is very pos-<lb/>sible, it may not be in the same
                            proportion, owing<lb/>to the use of spirituous liquors being more
                            prevalent<lb/>in the city than in the country.</p>
                        <p>If we could obtain 10,000 dollars a year, I would<lb/>propose, that the
                            Governors should open a loan, to<lb/>borrow 70,000 dollars, at six per
                            cent; this would<lb/>require 4,200 dollars to pay the interest, and
                            the<lb/>remainder, 5,800, might be appropriated towards the<lb/>expense
                            of supporting the establishment. If we can<lb/>obtain this annuity, it
                            will be highly important that<lb/>we should have it for as <emph
                                rend="italic">long</emph> a period as possible.<lb/>Suppose (in
                            order to keep the <emph rend="italic">time</emph> out of sight)
                            thee<lb/>should move to fill up the blank that will be left in<lb/>the

                        <p>The crowded situation of our state prison makes<lb/>it necessary, either
                            to enlarge the present building<lb/>or to erect a new one at <placeName
                                key="alban">Albany</placeName>, <placeName key="utica"
                                >Utica</placeName>, or some other<lb/>place.</p>
                        <p>The plan of the present prison was entirely my<lb/>own, and, although I
                            visited <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and
                            ex-<lb/>amined many of <persName key="jhowa1">Howard</persName>'s plans,
                            and was furnished<lb/>with several by my friend <persName key="wpitt1"
                                >William M. Pitt</persName>, a member<lb/>of Parliament for
                            Dorchester, of prisons in <placeName key="engl"
                            >England</placeName>,<lb/>yet a most striking error was committed in
                            our<lb/> plan;—it should have contained 500 rooms, 7 feet by<lb/>9 feet,
                            in order to keep the prisoners separate at<lb/><emph rend="italic"
                                >night</emph>—in the <emph rend="italic">day</emph> they are at
                            work, and have keep-<lb/>ers constantly with them, so that they have no
                            oppor-<lb/>tunity to corrupt each other;—this entirely destroys<lb/>the
                            designs of a penitentiary establishment, intended<lb/>to amend and
                            improve the habits of the convicts.<lb/>A few years since, one of the
                            commissioners appoint-<lb/>ed to build a penitentiary at <placeName
                                key="boston">Boston</placeName>, came to <placeName key="nycit"
                                >New-<lb/>York</placeName>, with a view to get information as to the
                            plan<lb/>for them to adopt; I urged them to have a separate<lb/>room for
                            each prisoner, and had such a plan drawn<lb/>under my direction; this
                            was adopted, and it is the<lb/>only prison in this country calculated to
                            answer the<lb/>design of forming such establishments. Having so<lb/>many
                            rooms, does not increase the expense, as the<lb/>prison need not be
                            built so strong, because there is<lb/>less danger of escape. If another
                            prison should be<lb/> erected, I sincerely hope it may be on the plan
                            of<lb/>having a separate room for each convict.</p>
                        <p>The number of convicts are considerably increased<lb/> (at least in this
                            city) on account of the sum which<lb/>makes grand larceny—this is twelve
                            dollars and<lb/>a half; it was fixed at fifty dollars, it would
                            con-<lb/>siderably lessen the number of prisoners in the
                            state<lb/>prison. I respectfully offer these hints, as some
                            sub-<lb/>ject relating to the state prison, or the existing
                            penal<lb/><pb n="245" facs="SW_TE1834_242"/>laws, may be presented to the legislature. I,

                            presumptive rights to all the<lb/>Indian reservations in this state, and
                            they are con-<lb/>triving to get the Indians to sell to them for a
                            small<lb/>sum; the poor Indians have been always cheated,<lb/>except by
                                <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName>, who uniformly done
                            them<lb/>justice, and thus preserved the high esteem and<lb/>regard of

                            and no war or bloodshed<lb/>for seventy years; and this would have
                            continued, if his<lb/>grand children, in <date when="1756">1756</date>,
                            had not attempted to cheat<lb/>the Indians, in purchasing their land. In
                            short, I am<lb/>perfectly satisfied, that in every war that has
                            occur-<lb/>red between the whites (Christians!) and Indians,<lb/>the
                            former has been aggressors. The condition of<lb/>these poor people is
                            shamefully neglected, and is<lb/>truly deserving our sympathy and
                            commiseration.<lb/>We enjoy, in a full extent, every blessing of
                            Heaven,<lb/>on the very land they formerly occupied, in
                            security,<lb/>peace, and plenty, as to game, fish, &amp;c.; we have<lb/>
                            abundance, whilst they often suffer for want of food,<lb/>clothing,
                            &amp;c. Under these considerations, it appears<lb/>to me, we ought to do
                            all in our power to meliorate<lb/>their condition, to protect them from
                            the violence and<lb/>imposition of the white people, and generally to
                            con-<lb/>tribute to their comfort and happiness, as far as
                            cir-<lb/>cumstances will permit. I will take the liberty to<lb/>state
                            hints of a plan, that, in my opinion, might be<lb/>productive of lasting

                        <p>We have lately been informed by some of our<lb/>friends who reside near

                                have been proceeded against, as the<lb/>law directs, yet, by their
                                influence with the chiefs,<lb/>the matter has been so represented to
                                the Governor, <lb/><pb n="247" facs="SW_TE1834_244"/>that he and the Attorney General

                                stopped<lb/>for the present, and the probability is, that
                                the<lb/>chiefs may address the Legislature, requesting a<lb/>law to
                                permit them to remain.</said></p>
                        <p>We are part of a committee of our society, appoint-<lb/>ed for the
                            purpose of promoting, among the Indians,<lb/>a disposition of
                            improvement in agriculture, and gene-<lb/>rally to meliorate their
                            condition; and we have al-<lb/>ways found, that they have been
                            exceedingly injured<lb/>in their morals, &amp;c. by the whites getting
                            on their<lb/>lands, and mixing with them.</p>
                        <p>From the conferences which some of us have had<lb/>with thee, relative to
                            the Indians, we have been in-<lb/>duced to believe thou feel an interest
                            in the welfare<lb/>of that people, and disposed to exert, not only
                            thy<lb/>private influence, as an individual, but thy
                            official<lb/>powers, as chief magistrate of the state, in
                            promoting<lb/>a redress of any grievances they may labour

                            others, so that every proper step may be taken<lb/>which justice and
                            humanity may dictate in the<lb/> premises.</p>
                        <p>We have a confidence that every thing on thy part<lb/>has, and will be
                            done, for the welfare of the Indians;<lb/>but, as an application may be
                            made by the white<lb/>people to the Legislature, for some law to be
                            passed,<lb/>by which they may unjustly get an advantage over<lb/>the
                            Indians, and as thou art, likely, very much occu-<lb/>pied at this time,
                            it is possible the subject may escape<lb/>thy memory; and we, therefore,

                        <p>Among other philanthropic establishments which<lb/>are yearly rising in

                            city, upon the principle suggested and explained<lb/>in my Treatise on

                            more limited scale. The practical effect<lb/>of these establishments,
                            was first manifested in <placeName key="scot"
                            >Scot-<lb/>land</placeName>, since which they have been extended to
                            several<lb/>towns in England, and are likely to become <emph

                            requires explanation.<lb/>The object is, to assist the labouring poor to
                            preserve<lb/>a portion of their earnings for old age, and to
                            give<lb/><pb n="249" facs="SW_TE1834_246"/>them provident habits. I send you, under
                            cover, the<lb/>plan of our institution, which has just
                            commenced,<lb/>and which has been the result of much discussion<lb/>and
                            deliberation. When <persName key="jfran1">Doctor Francis</persName>
                            returns, I<lb/>shall trouble him with a few of such publications
                            as<lb/>you may wish to possess. My various occupations,<lb/>joined to an
                            advanced period of life, render me less<lb/>able than I could wish, to
                            take an active share in<lb/>the management of many institutions of a
                            charitable<lb/>nature, to which I must be satisfied only to be
                            a<lb/>contributor. Many of them are excellent, while not<lb/>a few have
                            been established without the aid of that<lb/> caution and good judgment
                            which is calculated to<lb/>produce utility, which tends to reduce the
                            funds of<lb/>others, whose beneficial efforts are obvious and
                            cer-<lb/>tain; and hence it is, that much money is expended<lb/> where
                            little practical benefit results. Our Free<lb/>Schools, for the
                            education of the poor, are now be-<lb/>come very general all over the
                            country, which, I trust,<lb/>will give a new and improved character to
                            the rising<lb/>generation among the poor, which is so much want-<lb/>ed

                            <salute>ESTEEMED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>Thy very kind favour of <date when="1815-09-17">9th mo. 17th</date>, was
                            receiv-<lb/>ed some time since—its interesting details have<lb/>afforded
                            considerable satisfaction, and, with the work<lb/>on the constitution of
                            Lunatic Asylums, will be highly<lb/>useful to us. I should have replied
                            to thy letter sooner<lb/>than this date, but the Governors having
                            applied to<lb/> our Legislature for aid towards completing the
                            pro-<lb/>posed establishment, I waited to know the result, in<lb/>order
                            that I might inform thee. I have now the<lb/><pb n="250" facs="SW_TE1834_247"/>pleasure of
                            stating, that a law was passed, <date when="1816-05-17">17th
                            ult</date>.<lb/>to pay the Governors of the <placeName key="newyh"
                                >New-York Hospital</placeName>, ten<lb/>thousand dollars a year, in
                            quarter yearly payments,<lb/>for and during the term of forty-one years.
                            This<lb/>generous and liberal grant, is fully equal to our
                            ex-<lb/>pectations, and will be amply sufficient to enable us<lb/>to
                            erect extensive buildings, and every other improve-<lb/>ment. We
                            purchased thirty-eight acres of land, six<lb/>miles from the city—it is
                            on high ground, and com-<lb/>mands a most delightful and very extensive
                            view of<lb/>the village of <placeName key="harle">Haerlem</placeName>,
                                <placeName key="longi">Long Island</placeName>, and the
                            surround-<lb/>ing country. As to health, and good water, it is<lb/>equal
                            to any in the state of <placeName key="newyo">New-York</placeName>. Some
                            have<lb/>fears, that it is too far from the city; but on
                            that<lb/>account, it appears to me, there is no cause to be<lb/>afraid
                            that it will not be duly inspected—it is true,<lb/>the Governors all
                            reside in the city, but in the vicinity<lb/>of the premises there are a
                            number of very respecta-<lb/>ble suitable persons, (members of the
                            Corporation of<lb/>the Hospital) who would very cheerfully
                            undertake<lb/>the charge of visiting, &amp;c. so humane an
                            institution.</p>
                        <p>Several of the Governors have seats in the neigh-<lb/>bourhood, and are
                            out one half the year. It is pro-<lb/>posed, the intended building shall
                            accommodate two<lb/>hundred patients, calculated for all ranks of
                            life—as<lb/> well those of affluent as indigent circumstances,
                            and,<lb/>also, paupers, who are supported by the city, and
                            the<lb/>respective counties throughout the state—the latter<lb/>to be
                            paid for at the rate of two dollars per week,<lb/> and others from three
                            to ten dollars, according to<lb/>their circumstances, and the
                            accommodations they<lb/>may require.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, if it is well conducted, and managed<lb/>with prudence, it
                            will, not only essentially serve, and<lb/>be a great blessing to the
                            state at large, but may be<lb/>very profitable, and produce a
                            considerable revenue<lb/>to our hospital. I have no doubt, we shall have
                            it<lb/>full in two years after it is ready to receive patients.<lb/>On
                            one part of the premises there is abundance of<lb/><pb n="251" facs="SW_TE1834_248"/>valuable
                            good stone, but it may not be of a suitable<lb/>or handsome quality, to
                            make a good face for the<lb/>front or outside walls; if so, I was
                            thinking we may<lb/>put on a coat of rough cast, or plaster—this has
                            been<lb/>done on some of our public buildings, but, in
                            some<lb/>instances, it is apt to peel, or fall off, owing
                            (likely)<lb/>to severe frosts, or the want of knowing how to make<lb/>a
                            strong and good cement. In the north of <placeName key="euro"
                                >Europe</placeName>,<lb/>and, I believe, in <placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName>, they make a plaster that<lb/>would stand our
                            climate, and would answer the pur-<lb/>pose effectually. I have been
                            told they mix tarras,<lb/>(which we have imported from <placeName
                                key="amst">Amsterdam</placeName>,) or<lb/>Welsh lime, that is
                            considerably exported from <placeName key="brist2"
                                >Bris-<lb/>tol</placeName>. If thou could procure for me a receipt,
                            from<lb/>some distinguished mechanic, to make a suitable plas-<lb/>ter
                            that would answer the purpose, it might very<lb/>much serve us, and I
                            should esteem it as a particular<lb/>favour. It is not probable we shall
                            do more this<lb/>year, than lay the foundation of the building.
                            The<lb/>remarks in thy letter to me, and thy work, entitled,<lb/>Hints
                            on the construction of Lunatic Asylums, will<lb/>very much assist us in
                            forming our plan, and when<lb/>this is drawn, and concluded on, I
                            propose sending<lb/>thee a copy, in hopes thou wilt furnish us with
                            thy<lb/>observations for our government in improving of it.</p>
                        <p>If any thing farther occurs to thee, that would pro-<lb/>bably improve
                            our plan, or aid us in executing it, I<lb/>should be much obliged by thy

                        <p>I scarce know how to begin this letter, as I feel<lb/>ashamed and
                            mortified that I have so long neglected<lb/>replying to thy last very

                        <p>I rejoice to find such a number of your good people<lb/>in <placeName

                            your<lb/>Bible Society, and the immense sums raised for the<lb/>poor,
                            who have suffered by the calamity of war on<lb/>the continent, is truly
                            astonishing, and I sincerely<lb/>trust and believe, will procure the
                            blessing of Divine<lb/>Providence on your nation. The communications of
                            the<lb/> British and Foreign Bible Society, show that
                            genuine<lb/>religion is held in veneration, in many parts of
                            the<lb/>continent, to a much greater extent than many here-<lb/>tofore
                            believed. I trust it will yet appear more fully<lb/>in <placeName

                            seem-<lb/>ed to have been dead as to any sense of it. As the<lb/>spirit
                            of our most holy religion spreads over the<lb/>world, the condition of
                            mankind will be meliorated—<lb/>the minds of men will be softened,
                            instead of being<lb/> filled with bitterness, revenge, and hatred—they
                            will<lb/>learn of Christ to love each other, and thus, in God's<lb/>own
                            time, an end be put to war and bloodshed.<lb/>Owing to the late war, the
                            morals of the people of this<lb/> country have been (as was reasonably
                            to be expected)<lb/>much injured. Notwithstanding this, there is a
                            ge-<lb/>neral religious improvement evidently increasing<lb/>amongst all
                            denominations of Christians—so that I<lb/> entertain a hope, which, I
                            trust, is well grounded,<lb/>that, on the whole, we are growing better.

                                last year</date>, of which communication I now<lb/>send a copy) is
                            the one adopted at the Retreat, by the<lb/>Society of Friends, near
                                <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>The Governors have purchased thirty-eight acres<lb/>of land, about six
                            miles from the city, and propose<lb/>to erect a building to accommodate
                            two hundred<lb/>lunatic patients—the thirty-eight acres to be
                            divided,<lb/>and laid out in walks, gardens, &amp;c. for the
                            amuse-<lb/>ment and exercise of the patients who are fit to
                            par-<lb/>take of useful employment and recreation. Our<lb/>Legislature
                            has acted very liberally, and generously<lb/>granted us 10,000 dollars a
                            year, payable quarterly;<lb/>one half of this sum will enable us to make
                            a loan<lb/>of 80,000 dollars, so that we shall have very ample<lb/>funds
                            for erecting suitable buildings, and making<lb/>every necessary
                            improvement. I send thee the last<lb/>Report of the Governors, which
                            contains a memorial to<lb/>the Legislature on the subject, and fully
                            explains the<lb/>plan we propose to pursue. About a month ago,
                            I<lb/>attended the Legislature, at <placeName key="alban"
                                >Albany</placeName>, for the purpose<lb/>of aiding our application,
                            and obtained the loan<lb/>alluded to, granting us the above-mentioned
                            annuity,<lb/>for and during the term of forty-one years.</p>
                        <p>It is a considerable time since, that I met with, in<lb/> the Quarterly
                            Review, an account of thy very impor-<lb/>tant publication on the
                            wealth, power, resources, &amp;c.<lb/>of the British nation, and I have
                            been extremely<lb/>anxious to procure a copy; it is highly spoken of
                            by<lb/>those who have met with it in England, and it is<lb/><pb n="254" facs="SW_TE1834_251"/>wonderfully strange, that I cannot meet with a single<lb/>copy in this
                            city, or <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>Our <orgName key="nyfss">Free School Society</orgName>, under the
                            patronage of<lb/>the state, is in a flourishing situation; we have
                            two<lb/>schools under our care in this city, containing about<lb/>one
                            thousand scholars; we have ample funds, and<lb/>propose to erect two
                            other school houses next year.</p>
                        <p>There are now a school in every town in each of<lb/>the counties
                            throughout the state, all under the<lb/>patronage of the state; the sum
                            of 60,000 dollars is<lb/>now divided among them, according to the
                            number<lb/>of scholars in each school, and this fund, in a
                            few<lb/>years, will reach 200,000 dollars; besides this, they<lb/>are
                            obliged, each town, to raise, by tax, a sum equal<lb/>to what they
                            respectively receive from the state.</p>
                        <p>I shall esteem it as a very particular favour, if thou<lb/>will be so
                            good as to continue thy correspondence on<lb/>the general state and
                            improvements of the numerous<lb/> benevolent establishments in
                                <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>It is owing to thy very valuable correspondence<lb/>with me, that our
                                <placeName key="nycit">New-York</placeName> Free School is in
                            so<lb/>flourishing a situation as it is at present, and that the<lb/>
                            condition of the poor, in many respects, have been<lb/>considerably
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>I am, with the warmest sentiments of esteem and<lb/>regard, thy

                            <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>On the <date when="1816-06-03">3d instant</date>, I had the pleasure of
                            receiv-<lb/>ing your esteemed and acceptable letter of the <date
                                when="1816-05-05">5th<lb/>ultimo</date>.—No doubt can be entertained
                            of the benevo-<lb/>lence and good disposition of our nation, where
                            the<lb/> charity of all ranks, who have any thing to spare,<lb/>ramifies
                            in all directions. Besides the relief afforded<lb/>at home, nearly half
                            a million of money has been sent<lb/>to <emph rend="italic"><placeName
                                    key="spain">Spain</placeName>, <placeName key="portu"
                                    >Portugal</placeName>, <placeName key="germ"
                                >Germany</placeName>, and <placeName key="rus"
                                >Russia</placeName></emph>, during and<lb/>since the war, for the
                            relief of the sufferers. In the<lb/>course of the last and the present
                            year, nearly a mil-<lb/>lion more has been raised from individuals for
                            the re-<lb/>lief of the wives, and families, and relations, of
                            the<lb/>soldiers who fell at the great battle of Waterloo; be-<lb/>sides
                            a reward to those who survived this great strug-<lb/>gle, which
                            terminated a war of unexampled length,<lb/>and which desolated the
                            greatest part of <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>.<lb/>But this
                            benevolence is not confined to one object.<lb/>It has ramified in all
                            directions. The sums subscri-<lb/>bed to the Bible Society, has been
                            immense; and no<lb/>doubt is entertained of its being supported in
                            prefer-<lb/>ence to charities of every kind.</p>
                        <p>I trust that you and I shall never, in our days, see<lb/>the sword of war
                            unsheathed. There appears now<lb/>a strong disposition on the part of
                            the sovereigns and<lb/>rulers of all the great powers in Europe, to
                            cultivate<lb/>the arts of peace. The still perturbed and
                            unhappy<lb/>state of <placeName key="franc">France</placeName> is now
                            the only circumstance that is<lb/>likely to disturb our
                            tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>Our legislature, now freed from the distresses of<lb/>war, is sedulously
                            devoting itself to the state of our<lb/>police and internal policy.
                                <emph rend="italic">Mendicity, mad houses,<lb/>saving banks, the
                                pauper system</emph>, &amp;c. &amp;c., at present<lb/>engage their
                            attention: and the leading object is to<lb/>promote humanity, and to
                            improve the state of soci-<lb/>ety by education, provident habits, and
                            good laws, for<lb/>the prevention of moral and criminal offences.</p>
                        <p>A penitentiary house, on a very large scale, is part-<lb/><pb n="256" facs="SW_TE1834_253"/>ly
                            finished, in fields within the liberty of <placeName key="westm1"
                                >Westmin-<lb/>ster</placeName>, at the public expense, with all the
                            improvements<lb/>which experience has suggested, and a bill is
                            now<lb/>in the house, for regulating insane establishments,<lb/>and
                            appointing periodical visitants for the purpose of<lb/>promoting
                            humanity and preventing abuses. But,<lb/>after all, much remains to be
                            done. A continuance<lb/>of peace may do much. The legislature, however,
                            is<lb/>perhaps very properly slow in adopting new mea-<lb/>sures and in
                            abolishing old customs. These feelings<lb/>do not operate with the same
                            force in a new country.</p>
                        <p>I am surprised to find that my last work on the<lb/><emph rend="italic"
                                >Population, Power, and Revenue of the British Empire</emph>,<lb/>
                            had not been on sale in America; as the first edition<lb/>went off in
                            eight months, although a very expensive<lb/>book on account of the
                            number of tables. I have no<lb/>doubt of its being reprinted in America.
                            Already there<lb/>are two translations of the work in German, and
                            I<lb/>believe also in French. I believe <persName key="hclay1">Mr.
                                Clay</persName>, when here,<lb/>carried out a copy of it. He told me
                            he intended to<lb/>do so. I send you under cover an epitome of
                            this<lb/>work. It has been purchased by the ministers of all<lb/>the
                            nations of <placeName key="euro">Europe</placeName>, as well as many
                            other foreign-<lb/>ers. Through the medium of this work, much
                            has<lb/>been disclosed on subjects tending to promote the<lb/>happiness
                            of nations, and to prevent many of those<lb/>errors by which their
                            decline has been effected.</p>
                        <p>It is a pleasing circumstance, to find your country<lb/>is following our
                            example, with respect to free schools.<lb/>We, at last, discover here,
                            that the general education<lb/>of youth is not only the best prop to the
                            state, but to<lb/>the happiness and prosperity of the people. I
                            trust<lb/>your schools are established on a stable basis, which<lb/>can
                            undergo no unfavourable change by the death or<lb/>removal of the first
                            benevolent founders. For want<lb/>of this, many excellent institutions
                            have fallen into<lb/> decay, when their original founders were no
                            more.<lb/>As yet, our legislature has afforded no pecuniary aid<lb/>to
                            the numerous schools established in this country;<lb/><pb n="257" facs="SW_TE1834_254"/>they
                            are entirely supported by the benevolence of the<lb/>public. I trust,
                            ere long, their permanence will be<lb/>secured by a national
                            institution, embracing the whole<lb/>population.</p>
                        <p>I feel much gratified by the opportunity you afford-<lb/>ed me, of making
                            the acquaintance of <persName key="jfran1">Dr. Francis</persName>.<lb/>A
                            mind more ardent in the pursuit of useful know<lb/>ledge, perhaps, never
                            existed; and, I have no doubt<lb/>he will, in a few years, stand at the
                            head of his pro-<lb/>fession. I introduced him to my son-in-law,
                                <persName key="gyeat1">Dr. Yeats</persName>,<lb/>who is an able and

                            opportunity of<lb/>being useful to him.</p>
                        <p>My health declines, as may naturally be expected,<lb/>as old age
                            approaches; but, upon the whole, I have<lb/>no reason to complain.
                            Regularity and temperance<lb/>are my chief and best medicine for all
                            complaints.</p>
                        <p>I shall always be happy to hear from you, and to<lb/>make such
                            communications as I conceive may be<lb/>useful to mankind in general;

                        <p>The letters, dated on the <date when="1816-07-18">18th July last</date>,
                            and<lb/>which, as Secretary of the Board of
                            Commissioners,<lb/>constituted by the act, entitled, <q>an act to
                                provide for<lb/>the improvement of the internal navigation of
                                this<lb/> state,</q> you addressed to us, respectively, came to
                            hand,<lb/>with their enclosures, in due season.</p>
                        <p>We have forborne advertising our appointment, or<lb/>taking any step to
                            procure and receive subscriptions<lb/>in lands, or money, to be applied
                            to the construction<lb/>of the contemplated canals, from a conviction
                            that<lb/>an appeal to our fellow citizens for voluntary aid,<lb/>under
                            existing circumstances, would be premature.<lb/>Until the Legislature
                            has passed an act, whereby the<lb/>public faith is pledged for beginning
                            and complet-<lb/>ing the canal, we apprehend no discreet citizen
                            will<lb/>be disposed to deprive himself of the use of his land,<lb/>or
                            money, for a considerable period of time. The<lb/>sole object of the act
                            appointing the Commissioners,<lb/>is to obtain, from their report, a
                            mass of useful in-<lb/>formation, for the purpose of guiding the
                            judgment<lb/>of the Legislature, in deciding on the expediency of<lb/>
                            undertaking, or rejecting, the proposed enterprise.<lb/>Although we are
                            well persuaded that the trusts re- <lb/><pb n="259" facs="SW_TE1834_256"/>posed in the
                            Commissioners will appear to have been<lb/>executed with great ability,
                            and the utmost fidelity,<lb/>yet, their report, from the novelty and
                            magnitude of<lb/>its subject, may induce the Legislature to seek
                            fur-<lb/>ther information, before it finally decides on the<lb/>course
                            to be pursued. Thus, a final decision may<lb/>be delayed longer than the
                            ensuing session of the<lb/> Legislature; and, when every proper source
                            of inform-<lb/>ation has been exhausted, that decision may
                            be<lb/>against the enterprise. There is nothing in the pre-<lb/>sent act
                            to preclude such decision; and hence we<lb/>are of opinion, that the act
                            furnishes no adequate<lb/>motives for private subscriptions, either in
                            lands or<lb/>money.</p>
                        <p>We submit these sentiments to the Commissioners,<lb/>with all deference,
                            and we remain, with respect,</p>

                        <p>Many of our <orgName key="nymindian">Committee</orgName> have been, for
                            some time,<lb/> attentive to the situation of the <orgName key="seneca"
                                >Seneca</orgName> nation, and<lb/>have had great fears lest they
                            might be sadly im-<lb/>posed on, by the person who has purchased the

                                Company</orgName>. It may be<lb/>useful to state, that all the land

                                Genesee</geogName>, belonged originally to the state
                                of<lb/><placeName key="mass">Massachusetts</placeName>—that is, the
                            right of soil, or the exclu-<lb/>sive right of purchasing the same of
                            the Indians; the<lb/>right of jurisdiction has always been considered
                            to<lb/>be in the state of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>.
                            The state of <placeName key="mass">Massachu-<lb/>setts</placeName> sold
                            their pre-emption right to the whole coun-<lb/><pb n="260" facs="SW_TE1834_257"/>try, to

                                >Holland Company</persName>; the latter<lb/>(several years ago)
                            purchased all the said land of the<lb/>Indians, except certain tracts
                            which they reserved,<lb/>one situated at the <placeName key="catta1"
                                >Cattaraugus</placeName>, one at <placeName key="buffa"

                            right, for the whole of these reservations,<lb/>(we are told at 50 cents
                            per acre,) to a person who is<lb/>now a member of Congress, and resides
                            at <placeName key="hamil2">Hamilton</placeName>,<lb/>on the <geogName

                                key="philc">Philadelphia county</placeName>,) to hold a treaty at
                                <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>,<lb/>for the purpose of
                            trying to persuade the Indians to<lb/>exchange their reservations for
                            lands (which he <emph rend="italic">said</emph><lb/>he owned) on

                            United<lb/>States prohibit any treaty being held with the In-<lb/>dians,
                            for the purpose of purchasing their lands,<lb/><emph rend="italic"
                                >unless a Commissioner appointed by the President should<lb/>be
                                present</emph>. All the reservations are said to be lands<lb/>of the
                            very first quality, and particularly the one at<lb/><placeName
                                key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>, which is very valuable; a part of
                            it, adjoining<lb/>the village, is said to be worth from 100 to 200
                            dollars<lb/> per acre, if the Indian title was extinguished. It<lb/>has
                            been said, that on an average, that reservation<lb/>would sell for more
                            than thirty dollars per acre—<lb/>possibly this may be estimating it too
                            high. The<lb/>present holder of the pre-emption right is esteemed<lb/>a
                            respectable man, and, perhaps, would be more<lb/>scrupulous in the means
                            he might use, in effecting<lb/>his purchase of the Indians, than some
                            others might;<lb/>yet, as the temptation is powerful, and as in
                            the<lb/>general practice of men, (who are commonly <emph rend="italic"
                                >called</emph><lb/>honest,) it is really considered not to be
                            criminal to<lb/>impose on <emph rend="italic">Indians</emph>, advantage
                            has been taken of<lb/>their ignorance and credulity;—a man's
                            character<lb/><pb n="261" facs="SW_TE1834_258"/>seems not to be lessened in the esteem of
                            his acquaint-<lb/>ance, if he should endeavour to get the chiefs in
                            a<lb/>state of intoxication, in order to gain their influence<lb/>over
                            the nation, with a view that he may make a<lb/>profitable bargain. It
                            is, we believe, true, that the<lb/>consent, or act of the chiefs, binds
                            the whole nation,<lb/>in sales of their lands; but, generally, the whole
                            are<lb/>consulted, yet often (mostly) the chiefs are bribed
                            to<lb/>consent, in order to influence the others. Although<lb/>no treaty
                            can be held for purchasing without a Com-<lb/>missioner, appointed by
                            the President, be present, to<lb/>prevent the Indians being imposed on,
                            yet it would<lb/>probably not be difficult for him to get such a
                            man<lb/>appointed as would answer his purposes. Many per-<lb/>sons,
                            (high in office in this state,) who profess, and,<lb/>indeed, seem to be
                            well disposed and friendly to the<lb/>Indians, have openly and decidedly
                            given their opi-<lb/>nions, that it would be better for them to sell
                            their<lb/> reservations, and remove to some remote situation to<lb/>the
                            Westward; they say that now they are exposed<lb/>to a constant
                            intercourse with bad whites, who sup-<lb/>ply them with rum, and in
                            every way try to cheat<lb/>them, and corrupt their principles, and, if
                            they re-<lb/>main, the consequence will be, that they will be
                            soon<lb/>extinct. They add, that the Christian party, at<lb/>
                            <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, owing to their having more
                            intercourse with<lb/>the whites, are more depraved than the Pagan
                            party.<lb/>It is, perhaps, not in our power to say, whether
                            such<lb/>removal would, eventually, be better for the Indians<lb/>or
                            not; but it appears to us, that if they should go<lb/>far West, they
                            will still be exposed to the same evil,<lb/>and would suffer still
                            worse, from a kind of white<lb/>people, who are not so much under the
                            restraints of<lb/>law as the same description of whites who
                            now<lb/>surround them. At present, the influence of many<lb/>respectable
                            persons, who reside near them, serves<lb/>much to protect them from
                            frequent injury and im-<lb/>position, and the assistance they would,
                            from time to<lb/>time, receive from Friends, might, at least,
                            preserve<lb/><pb n="262" facs="SW_TE1834_259"/>them from going backwards, and possibly
                            tend to<lb/>advance them in agriculture, &amp;c. Taking a view
                            of<lb/>the whole subject, in all its various ramifications,
                            we<lb/>cannot but believe it would be most for the advan-<lb/>tage of
                            the Indians, to remain on their respective<lb/> reservations.</p>
                        <p>It may be useful to examine, 1st. Suppose the In-<lb/>dians should
                            conclude to sell their present posses-<lb/>sions, is it expedient for
                            Friends to offer them assist-<lb/>ance and advice? 2nd. If it is deemed
                            proper for<lb/>Friends to interfere, then what course would be most<lb/>
                            advisable? 3rd. What advice should be given to<lb/>them, in case the
                            Indians should ask for it?</p>
                        <p>In reply to the first proposition, we are of opinion,<lb/>that if they
                            should conclude to sell, it would not be ex-<lb/>pedient to offer
                            assistance, or advice, unsolicited, as<lb/>it would irritate the person
                            who holds the pre-emp-<lb/>tion right, and the conduct of Friends might
                            be<lb/>wrongly represented to both Indians and whites, and<lb/>in many
                            ways it might prove injurious to the cause<lb/>in which we are
                            engaged.</p>
                        <p> In reply to the second proposition, we think Friends<lb/>cannot be
                            indifferent spectators, if the Indians should<lb/>agree to dispose of
                            their lands, as our minds are im-<lb/>pressed with a belief, that great
                            unfairness would<lb/>most probably be shown towards them. It
                            might<lb/>be right to interfere, so far as that a
                            sub-committee,<lb/>from your general committee, might wait on
                            the<lb/>President, and confidentially communicate to him<lb/>the
                            propriety of his being on his guard in selecting<lb/>a person as
                            Commissioner, urging to him the neces-<lb/>sity of appointing a person
                            of established good repu-<lb/>tation, of undoubted integrity, and purity
                            of charac-<lb/>ter. If the Indians are induced to make
                            application,<lb/>and <emph rend="italic">solicit</emph> the advice of
                            Friends, it appears to us<lb/>Friends might (and perhaps ought to)
                            afford every<lb/>assistance and advice they might require; but,
                            even<lb/>then, it would be necessary to exercise great pru-<lb/>dence
                            and circumspection in every movement.</p>
                        <pb n="263" facs="SW_TE1834_260"/>
                        <p>In reply to the third proposition—If the Indians <emph rend="italic"
                                >ask</emph><lb/>for advice, after they may have determined on a
                            sale,<lb/>the advice proper to be given them must depend<lb/>upon
                            circumstances that may then be unfolded. If<lb/>they ask for advice,
                            whether they had best remove<lb/>to the westward, or, if it would be
                            best for them to<lb/>remain on their reservations, the sentiments
                            of<lb/>Friends might then be communicated to them, and,<lb/>if they
                            should be fixed in their intention to make<lb/>sale, perhaps it might be
                            well to propose to them to<lb/>sell one of their reservations, or, if
                            each reservation<lb/>belongs to a particular tribe, then each tribe to
                            sell a<lb/>portion of their respective reservation; for the
                            remain-<lb/>der, (not sold,) they might, perhaps, be persuaded
                            to<lb/>employ a surveyor, and have it divided into lots of<lb/>100 acres
                            each—a lot to be the separate property of<lb/>each Indian family—to go
                            by descent to nearest kin,<lb/>in the same manner as estates with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>We have thus far, in freedom, endeavoured to ex-<lb/>hibit to your view,
                            our sentiments, as they have<lb/>occurred; and have been more
                            particular, as the lands<lb/>are in this state, and, therefore, thought,
                            perhaps,<lb/>you might not be acquainted with all the

                            been longer conversant with Indian affairs than our-<lb/>selves, we
                            leave the subject to your farther investiga-<lb/>tion, and, if at any
                            time we can be useful, we will<lb/>very readily attend to any farther

                        <p>As to the situation of the <orgName key="brotherton">Brothertown
                                Indians</orgName>,<lb/>we may inform you, that many years ago,
                            (perhaps<lb/>thirty,) the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>,
                            taking into consideration the<lb/>situation of the remains of several
                            tribes of Indians<lb/>on the east end of <placeName key="longi">Long
                                Island</placeName>, <placeName key="narra">Narraganset</placeName>,
                            and<lb/>other parts near the sea shore, concluded to make<lb/>them a
                            present of a piece of land, (now called <placeName key="broth"
                                >Bro-<lb/>thertown</placeName>,) six miles square, without the power
                            of<lb/>alienation. Some families of those Indians moved<lb/>on to this
                            tract, and the white people soon got in<lb/><pb n="264" facs="SW_TE1834_261"/>among them,
                            persuaded the Indians, when in a state<lb/>of intoxication, to sell them
                            their improvement, with<lb/>several lots of 100 and 200 acres. About the year<lb/>
                            <date when="1794">1794</date>, a deputation of <orgName key="brotherton"
                                >Indians</orgName>, from <placeName key="broth"
                                >Brothertown</placeName>,<lb/>came to some Friends of this city, and
                            stated their<lb/>situation to be very deplorable, owing to the
                            imposi-<lb/>tion and very bad conduct of the white people, whom<lb/>they
                            had admitted into their settlement. Two<lb/>Friends went with these
                            deputies to the Governor,<lb/>and the situation of the Indians were
                            represented to<lb/>him. Agreeably to the orders of the Governor,
                            the<lb/>sheriff took a number of civil officers, and turned off<lb/>the
                            intruders. In two years after this, the Indians<lb/>came again to
                                <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, and represented that
                            the<lb/>white people had returned with additional numbers.<lb/>and that
                            their situation was now much more deplo-<lb/>rable. The subject was
                            referred to the Legislature,<lb/>then in session. An act passed,
                            appointing three<lb/> Commissioners to proceed to <placeName key="broth"
                                >Brothertown</placeName>, and adjust<lb/>the business, with the
                            concurrence of the Indians, in<lb/>any way they might be of opinion
                            would be most to<lb/>their advantage. It was agreed by the
                            Commis-<lb/>sioners, with the consent of the Indians, to set off
                            in<lb/>one corner of the tract, about 6000 acres, and settle<lb/>the
                            same in lots of 50 to 100 acres to each of the in-<lb/>truders, who were
                            to pay the state for the same five<lb/>or six dollars per acre, the
                            state to pay the interest<lb/>(seven per cent.) on the proceeds of the
                            sale (amount-<lb/>ing to 2169 dollars a year) to three persons, to
                            be<lb/>appointed superintendents of the affairs of the <orgName
                                key="brotherton">Bro-<lb/>thertown Indians</orgName>, to be laid out
                            by them, for sup-<lb/>porting a school, and other purposes, for the
                            benefit<lb/> of the Indians. The remainder of the land was divi-<lb/>ded
                            into 100 and 50 acre lots, and allotted, 100 to a<lb/>family, and 50 to
                            a young man. By an act confirm-<lb/>ing the acts of the Commissioners,
                            five Indians were<lb/>to be annually appointed, called peace makers,
                            who<lb/>were to act the same as justices of the peace, to hold<lb/>a
                            court monthly, to settle differences, and issue exe-<lb/><pb n="265" facs="SW_TE1834_262"/>cution to an Indian constable, for debts under ten<lb/>dollars,
                            &amp;c. This act you may find in the revised<lb/>laws of <placeName

                        <p> I return thee my most sincere and warmest thanks<lb/>for thy kind letter
                            and valuable pamphlets, sent me<lb/>by <persName key="jfran1">Dr.
                                Francis</persName>, and should, before this time, have<lb/>made my
                            acknowledgments for these favours, had I<lb/>met with a suitable
                            opportunity of a person by whom<lb/>I could have sent some tracts.</p>
                        <p>I have the pleasure to state, that at <placeName key="hartf"
                                >Hartford</placeName>, in<lb/><placeName key="connt"
                                >Connecticut</placeName>, they have formed a valuable and
                            exten-<lb/>sive establishment for instructing the deaf and
                            dumb,<lb/>which has been aided by their legislature, and
                            con-<lb/>siderable subscriptions of private individuals of
                            that<lb/>State, and citizens of this and other adjoining<lb/> States.
                            The Institution is to be under the superin-<lb/>tendance and management
                            of my friend, <persName key="tgall1">Gallaudet</persName>,<lb/>who will
                            have, as an assistant, a Frenchman who is<lb/>deaf and dumb, and who was
                            a professor, several<lb/>years, in the institution at Paris. Nothing of
                            the<lb/>kind exists in any other part of the United States;<lb/>and, in
                            my opinion, the <placeName key="hartf">Hartford</placeName>
                            establishment will<lb/>be sufficient to serve all the states north of

                        <p>Among the many philanthropic institutions with<lb/>which your country
                            abounds, there is none that ap-<lb/>pears to me more likely to be useful
                            than saving<lb/>banks. They are certainly most admirably calculated<lb/>
                            to be beneficial to the poor, by promoting amongst<lb/><pb n="266" facs="SW_TE1834_263"/>them
                            a spirit of independence, economy, and industry.<lb/>Immediately on
                            receiving from thee an account of<lb/>the provident institution in your
                            metropolis, I pro-<lb/>posed to a number of my friends to establish a
                            simi-<lb/>lar one in this city. A plan was formed, and a<lb/>number of
                            our most respectable citizens agreed to<lb/>undertake the management of
                            it; but we found that<lb/>we could not go into operation without an act
                            of<lb/> incorporation, for which we made an application to<lb/>the
                            legislature, and the result is not yet known.</p>
                        <p>An act is now before our legislature, for comple-<lb/>ting a <geogName

                            Esq., has with him a map<lb/>and profile of the track of the <geogName

                            interesting to thee.</p>
                        <p>We have now, in this city, twenty-seven <emph rend="italic"
                            >Sunday</emph><lb/> schools, at which 5000 scholars are instructed.
                            I<lb/>lately visited two of them, kept for black people,<lb/>adults; at
                            one of them, I noticed two black women,<lb/>one of them seventy, and the

                            throughout our State, and our govern-<lb/>ment have made very liberal

                                when="1816-05-04">4th May</date>, is intended to be commenced
                            building<lb/><pb n="267" facs="SW_TE1834_264"/>this season. The plan being adopted
                            through my<lb/>recommendation, I feel myself under an obligation<lb/>to
                            pay attention to it, and this occupies, at present,<lb/>a great portion
                            of my time. We propose to have<lb/>separate buildings for men and women
                            patients,<lb/>about 300 feet distant from each other, besides
                            one<lb/>other building, remote from these, for violent <emph
                                rend="italic">noisy<lb/>patients</emph>; this will be a great
                            improvement on the <emph rend="italic">old</emph><lb/>system, of having
                            them <emph rend="italic">all</emph> under one roof.</p>
                        <p>There is no one evil prevalent in this country, we<lb/>have so much
                            reason to lament and deplore, as the<lb/>intemperate use of ardent
                            spirits. It is distilled<lb/>mostly from grain, in every part of the
                            United States,<lb/>and sold at about seventy-five cents per gallon.
                            The<lb/>quantity of brandy, gin, and rum imported from<lb/>Europe and
                            the West Indies, and whiskey, &amp;c., made<lb/>in this country, is
                            equal to twenty-four millions of<lb/>gallons, so that, supposing the
                            population of the Uni-<lb/>ted States to be eight millions, this gives
                            to each man,<lb/>woman, and child, three gallons a-year! In the
                            late<lb/> war, it is supposed six thousand persons lost their<lb/>lives,
                            owing to that dreadful calamity, and that a<lb/>greater number of
                            persons were destroyed during<lb/>that period by the use of spirituous
                            liquors. This<lb/>vice enervates the mind to such a degree, that of
                            the<lb/>individuals whose habits are fixed in the use of
                            it,<lb/>scarcely one in one thousand leave it off; attention<lb/>to
                            wives, children, friends, their own interest, health,<lb/> character,
                            rank in life, and reputation, are all sacri-<lb/>ficed to gratify their
                            inclination for this most dreadful<lb/>poison. There appears no remedy
                            sufficient to cure<lb/>this disease of the mind, but the operation of
                            the<lb/> power of religion.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioners to connect the navigable<lb/>waters of <geogName

                                >Hudson River</geogName>, have not<lb/>yet appointed an engineer,
                            and it is difficult to select<lb/>a person for so important and
                            responsible a situa-<lb/>tion. The appointment will be a very
                            honourable<lb/>one, and it is very desirable it should be
                            conferred<lb/>on a man fully competent, and deserving entire
                            con-<lb/>fidence; to direct the manner in which the various<lb/> parts
                            of the work should be executed—to make con-<lb/>tracts with the workmen,
                            &amp;c. &amp;c. requires a combina-<lb/>tion of talents, industry, and
                            intelligence, that is rare-<lb/>ly to be found in an individual. I have

                            <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I arrived here the day before yesterday, and I<lb/>have this day received
                            the appointment of surveyor<lb/>for the contemplated grand <geogName
                                key="eriec">canal</geogName>. My friend, <persName key="teddy1"
                                >Thomas<lb/>Eddy</persName>, of this city, has generally been in the
                            first<lb/>rank amongst his fellow citizens, as an active and<lb/>
                            efficient promoter of useful and benevolent works,<lb/>has long been one
                            of the Commissioners for this par-<lb/>ticular object, and though he is
                            not now one, still<lb/>retains all his wishes for its success, and the
                            ener-<lb/>gies of his mind are still in full activity for its
                            accom-<lb/>plishment. He has mentioned, in conversation with<lb/>me, his
                            views, that the task of the ascertainment of<lb/>lines, and the
                            superintendence of the work of making<lb/>the <geogName key="eriec"
                                >canal</geogName>, would be too burdensome for <emph rend="italic"
                                >one man</emph>—<lb/>that the magnitude of the object, would not
                            only<lb/>render expedient, but necessary, the employment of<lb/>two
                            Superintendents, an Engineer, and a Mathema-<lb/>tician, each in his
                            appropriate department. I per-<lb/>fectly accord with him in these
                            views. I mentioned<lb/>to him <persName key="tmoor1">Thomas
                                Moore</persName>, a man whom I know to be<lb/>eminently qualified
                            for the undertaking—of a sound<lb/>and discriminating mind—a judicious
                            and practical<lb/>engineer, and one with whom I shall be glad to
                            act.<lb/>I remarked, that thou wast well acquainted with
                            his<lb/>qualifications and talents, and suggested the proprie-<lb/>ty of
                            his addressing thee on the subject, and request-<lb/>ing thy opinion. He
                            alleged he had no acquaintance<lb/> with thee, but if I would write, he
                            would enclose<lb/>my letter in a few lines from himself.</p>
                        <p>I know not whether <persName key="tmoor1">Thomas Moore</persName> would
                            accept<lb/>such an appointment, but I am induced to believe
                            the<lb/>Commissioners would be liberal in their offer; and I<lb/>also
                            believe his correctness and economy to be such<lb/>in the application of
                            public money, that more would<lb/>be saved by giving <emph rend="italic"
                                >him</emph> a salary of 10,000 dollars a<lb/>year, than employing

                        <p>The <orgName key="ambib">American Society</orgName> have printed a number

                            stating the views of this society; but they<lb/>have not yet concluded
                            to what part of the world it<lb/>would be most advisable to recommend
                            their emigra-<lb/>tion. This society is about sending an agent
                                to<lb/><placeName key="afri">Africa</placeName>, to endeavour to
                            procure an asylum for them<lb/>at Sherbro, near <placeName key="sierr"

                            <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your obliging<lb/>favour of the
                                <date when="1817-04-09">9th of April</date> last, with the
                            accompany-<lb/>ing books and pamphlets, which were safely
                            deli-<lb/>vered by Mr. <persName key="jgrei1">Greig</persName>, and for
                            which I beg you will<lb/>accept of my best thanks. I should have done
                            this<lb/> at an earlier period, had I not waited for <persName
                                key="jgrei1">Mr. Greig</persName>'s<lb/>return, which has been
                            protracted far beyond the<lb/>time either he or I had calculated upon.
                            He has been<lb/><pb n="272" facs="SW_TE1834_269"/>so obliging as to take charge of a parcel
                            for you, in<lb/>which, according to your desire, you will find a
                            copy<lb/>of my Treatise on Indigence, and the three last re-<lb/>ports
                            of our Society for bettering the Condition of the<lb/>Poor, with several
                            other tracts, which I trust you will<lb/>find interesting.</p>
                        <p>It is pleasing to observe the rapid progress you<lb/>make in originating,
                            and carrying into effect, useful<lb/> institutions for improving the
                            state of society in your<lb/>country, in all which you appear to act a
                            prominent<lb/>part; and well may it be said, <emph rend="italic">that
                                you deserve well of<lb/>your country</emph>, since your whole time
                            and attention are<lb/>bestowed in promoting measures tending to the
                                <emph rend="italic">pre-<lb/>vention of criminal offences, to the
                                religious and moral<lb/>instruction of infants and adults, to the
                                relief of mental<lb/>and bodily infirmity</emph>, and <emph
                                rend="italic">to the general improvement of<lb/>the morals of the
                                people</emph>.</p>
                        <p>You will observe, that so far back as the year<lb/><date when="1806"
                                >1806</date>, I recommended Provident Banks, in my Trea-<lb/>tise on
                            Indigence, upon a national plan. The idea<lb/>of such institutions
                            originated with me ; but the pub-<lb/>lic mind was not then prepared for
                            such institutions,<lb/>and I much fear they will not be rendered
                            perma-<lb/>nent under the present system, on account of the la-<lb/>bour
                            attending the gratuitous management, although<lb/>our legislature has
                            afforded them some facilities, with<lb/>respect to the deposits. Had my
                            plan been adopted<lb/>in <date when="1806">1806</date>, I am certain
                            that not less than seven mil-<lb/>lions sterling of the property of the
                            labouring classes<lb/>would have now been yielding interest. The
                            insti-<lb/>tutions, however, as now constituted, have
                            become<lb/>popular, and they are spreading fast all over
                            the<lb/>country; but the demand for labour, in consequence<lb/>of the
                            happy return of peace, is unfortunately much<lb/>less than the supply,
                            and the poor, out of work, or<lb/>being only half employed, and wages
                            being generally<lb/>reduced, they have little to spare; but, upon the
                            whole,<lb/>more money is deposited than could reasonably have<lb/> been
                            expected. In <date when="1816">1816</date>, and part of last year,
                            there<lb/><pb n="273" facs="SW_TE1834_270"/>was much distress in the country, in
                            consequence of<lb/>the general stagnation of trade and
                            manufactures,<lb/>and the low price of agricultural produce; but
                            of<lb/>late a favourable change has taken place: the ma-<lb/>nufacturers
                            are generally well employed, and the<lb/> agricultural produce makes a
                            fair return to the<lb/>farmers.</p>
                        <p>This country has made great efforts, as well as<lb/>very considerable
                            pecuniary sacrifices, to induce the<lb/>nations of <placeName key="euro"
                                >Europe</placeName> to abandon the odious slave trade,<lb/>and they
                            are likely to be successful at last; and,<lb/>after the lapse of two
                            years, I trust, it will no longer<lb/>exist. We continue to go on here
                            in promoting phi-<lb/>lanthropic institutions; but it requires much
                            good<lb/>judgment, and a perfect knowledge of the world, to<lb/>select
                            those which, in their practical effect, shall pro-<lb/>duce that good to
                            the community, which will com-<lb/>pensate the expense and gratuitous
                            labour which is<lb/>required. Theories are often fallacious, although
                            of<lb/>much promise, and it is only in their practical effect<lb/>that
                            their real utility is discovered.</p>
                        <p>Our London hospitals have undergone much im-<lb/>provement of late,
                            especially since they have attracted<lb/>the notice of the legislature;
                            and, I trust, they will<lb/>be farther ameliorated.</p>
                        <p>We find here the same corruption of morals, arising<lb/>from the
                            immoderate use of ardent spirits in vulgar<lb/>life, which you
                            experience at <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>. It is a<lb/>
                            malady in the moral world which is difficult to cure,<lb/>and our only
                            hope is, that the rising generation, from<lb/>being better taught, in
                            consequence of the general<lb/>dissemination of free schools, will
                            conduct themselves<lb/> with more propriety. The quantity of gin drank
                            by<lb/>the lower orders of society in this great and over-<lb/>grown
                            metropolis, in which so many loose and dis-<lb/>solute characters are
                            congregated, exceeds all calcu-<lb/>lation, and there is no doubt of
                            many thousands<lb/>being sent prematurely to the grave, by indulging
                            in<lb/>this odious vice. I have for twenty-five years, as a <lb/><pb
                                n="274" facs="SW_TE1834_271"/>magistrate, exerted myself to the utmost to check
                            the<lb/>progress of this crying evil, by suppressing liquor<lb/>shops;
                            but, as those licensed to sell ale and beer, or<lb/>porter, are also
                            entitled to retail spirits, the task<lb/>became extremely difficult. In
                            this country it is a<lb/>productive source of revenue. Referring you to
                            our<lb/>mutual good friend for further particulars, I remain<lb/>always,

                        <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of thy ac-<lb/>ceptable favour of <date
                                when="1818-03-05">3d mo. 5th</date>, which has been
                            com-<lb/>municated to the Board of Trustees of our <orgName key="nyfss"
                                >Free<lb/> School Society</orgName>. They were highly pleased with
                            the<lb/>care and attention of the British and Foreign Society,<lb/>in
                            procuring a person, by thy account, so suitably<lb/>qualified to take
                            charge of the schools under their<lb/>care, as <persName key="cpict1"
                                >Charles Picton</persName>. We hope he is now on his<lb/>passage to
                            this country, and that he will soon be with<lb/>us. Our annual report is
                            now printing, and I hope<lb/>to get a copy in time to send thee by this
                            opportunity.<lb/>We have just established a third school near this
                            city,<lb/>of about two hundred scholars, and we are about<lb/>erecting a
                            school house, (No. 4,) to accommodate six<lb/>hundred, so that at the
                            close of this year the Society<lb/> will have under their charge about
                            two thousand<lb/>children. The system is spreading in a most
                            remark-<lb/>able manner in every part of this state, and indeed<lb/>very
                            generally through the United States. The slave<lb/>states are much
                            behind all others in every thing that<lb/>relates to religious or moral
                            improvements. The<lb/>Sunday School Society in this city have
                            succeeded<lb/>in a most wonderful manner. They have
                            thirty-six<lb/>schools open every first day, and in the whole
                            about<lb/><pb n="275" facs="SW_TE1834_272"/>three thousand five hundred children are
                            regularly<lb/>instructed in school learning, and much pains taken<lb/>in
                            their religious and moral instruction. The best<lb/>school in this city
                            is the African Free School, under<lb/>the care of our Abolition Society.
                            They have in this<lb/>school from two hundred and fifty to three
                            hundred<lb/>children ; besides this, some young women (Friends)<lb/>have
                            a first day school for black women. I lately<lb/>visited it, and noticed
                            one woman seventy-two years<lb/>of age, and another
                            ninety-one!—Including these<lb/> schools, and Sunday schools, there are
                            about six hun-<lb/>dred people of colour who receive the benefits of
                            edu-<lb/>cation in this city.</p>
                        <p>I should esteem it a particular favour if thou<lb/>wouldst send me a
                            number of your last Annual Report<lb/>of the British and Foreign School
                            Society, and also<lb/> some of the former years. If you have published
                            a<lb/>historical account of that society, it would also be<lb/>very
                            acceptable.</p>

                                the next<lb/>Legislature, such alterations and amendments of
                                the<lb/>existing laws relative to crimes and their
                                punish-<lb/>ments, as in their opinion may best conduce to
                            the<lb/><pb n="276" facs="SW_TE1834_273"/>welfare of the state, by the prevention of
                                crimes,<lb/>with such reasons and observations as they may<lb/>deem
                                requisite to explain and elucidate the al-<lb/>terations or
                                improvements they may recommend;<lb/>and to inquire into and examine
                                the first and<lb/>present administration of the State Prison, and
                                to<lb/>point out the defects, if any exist, in the manage-<lb/>ment
                                and government thereof, and what alterations<lb/>and improvements in
                                their opinion may be necessary;<lb/>and also to devise and propose a
                                plan of prisons to<lb/>be erected in different parts of the state,
                                for the con-<lb/>finement of persons convicted of minor offences;
                                and<lb/> generally to suggest all such other matters, as in
                                their<lb/>opinion may conduce to the improvement and
                                per-<lb/>fection of the penal code. And that the Commis-<lb/>sioners
                                so appointed, be authorized and empowered,<lb/>and are hereby
                                authorized and empowered, to send<lb/>for persons and papers, and to
                                reduce all examina-<lb/>tions and evidences taken by them to
                                writing, and<lb/> annex the same to their report.</said></p>
                        <p>The foregoing resolution was presented to the As-<lb/>sembly, passed that
                            House, and was sent to the Se-<lb/>nate. I believe it also passed that
                            branch of the<lb/>Legislature, but am not informed if
                            Commissioners<lb/>have been appointed; if they should be, their
                            report,<lb/>I think, might afford interesting matter for your
                            So-<lb/>ciety, on the melioration of the penal system. It has<lb/>been a
                            favourite object with me for some years past,<lb/>to have prisons built
                            in districts throughout the state,<lb/>two or three counties to form a
                            district, for solitary<lb/> confinement, and divided into rooms six feet
                            by nine,<lb/>and to be appropriated solely for the punishment
                            of<lb/>minor offences—<emph rend="italic">to be kept perfectly clean and
                                neat</emph>,<lb/>and the term of confinement not to exceed sixty
                            or<lb/>ninety days; their friends not to be permitted to visit<lb/>them,
                            except by special permission in writing, direct-<lb/>ed to the keeper of
                            the prison. They should not be<lb/>employed at any kind of work, and no
                            book allowed<lb/>them except the Bible, or some suitable religious
                            tract. <lb/><pb n="277" facs="SW_TE1834_274"/>The plan mentioned by thee of a Reformatory for
                            six<lb/>hundred boys, is the wisest and best ever proposed,<lb/>provided
                            it be so built as that each boy be lodged in<lb/>a separate room; in the
                            day, when at work, they will<lb/>have keepers constantly with them, and
                                <emph rend="italic">then</emph> it will<lb/> be very easy to prevent
                            them talking or having<lb/>any improper communication with each
                            other;—if<lb/>more than one is in a room at night, they would
                            as-<lb/>suredly corrupt each other, and thus your design, or<lb/>
                            reformation, must be defeated.</p>
                        <p>The administration of the New York State Prison<lb/>has been very badly
                            managed for many years; the<lb/>amount of expenditures are from twenty
                            to thirty<lb/>thousand dollars yearly more than the amount
                            pro-<lb/>duced by the labour of the convicts. When Friends<lb/>had the
                            management, it was entirely different, as<lb/>will be seen by my book,
                            published in <date when="1804">1804</date>, a copy<lb/>of which was sent
                            thee some time ago. In <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadel-<lb/>phia</placeName>, the affairs of their State Prison
                            are managed<lb/>with much care and prudence, and the profit on
                            the<lb/>labour of the convicts is several thousand dollars<lb/>more than
                            the cost of support and maintenance.<lb/>The friends to the penitentiary
                            system have been<lb/>in some degree disappointed as it regards
                            reforma-<lb/>tion of the convicts, and this, in my opinion, is
                            entire-<lb/>ly owing to the improper construction of our
                            prisons.<lb/>The rooms are calculated too large, and in
                            conse-<lb/>quence of this, twelve to fifteen are put in each room<lb/>at
                            night, and of course they corrupt each other, and<lb/>it is not
                            unreasonable to believe that many become<lb/>more wicked and
                            incorrigible from their impri-<lb/>sonment. The only wise plan then is,
                            for keepers<lb/>to be constantly with them during the day whilst<lb/>at
                            labour, and at night, let each one be lodged in<lb/>separate cells.</p>
                        <p>I have many numbers of the Philanthropist, and<lb/>would be thankful if
                            thou wouldst direct them to be<lb/>regularly sent me.</p>

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I had the pleasure of writing you on the <date when="1818-02-20">20th
                                of<lb/>February</date>, by my friend <persName key="jgrei1">Mr.
                                Greig</persName>, and I have recent-<lb/>ly had the satisfaction of
                            learning from him, that the<lb/>papers he was so good as to take charge
                            of, were<lb/>safely delivered into your hands, and that you were<lb/>in
                            good health. You will see by referring to my<lb/>Treatise on Indigence,
                            which I sent you, that I was<lb/>the first to suggest the establishment
                            of saving banks,<lb/>so far back as the year <date when="1806"
                                >1806</date>. Happy would it have<lb/>been for this country, if
                            this, and my various other<lb/>suggestions for the amelioration of
                            society, had been<lb/><pb n="279" facs="SW_TE1834_276"/>attended to at the time they were
                            brought forward;<lb/>but the public mind in this country, and
                            particularly<lb/> the Parliament, do not see good objects quickly.
                            The<lb/>proposition was made, when a leading member<lb/>brought in a
                            bill for amending the Poor Laws in <date when="1806"
                            >1806</date>,<lb/>which did not pass the Lower House. Three
                            years<lb/>ago, the establishment of local banks for
                            savings<lb/>originated in <placeName key="scot">Scotland</placeName>,
                            and their utility being (as I<lb/>had predicted) rendered manifest, they
                            got a footing<lb/>in this country. They have recently been
                            recognized<lb/>by government, and there are now about two hun-<lb/>dred
                            establishments in different parts of <placeName key="engl">Great
                                Britain</placeName><lb/>and <placeName key="irel"
                                >Ireland</placeName>: but as the superintendence is
                            gratui-<lb/>tous, and the organization of a nature not to
                            ensure<lb/>permanency, (which was the main feature in my<lb/>plan,) I
                            doubt their success on the present footing.</p>
                        <p> A gentleman of the name of <persName key="woods1">Woodson</persName>,
                            has propo-<lb/>sed an improvement. He sent me his pamphlet, (a<lb/>copy
                            of which I inclose you,) requesting at the same<lb/>time, that my
                            assistance and influence might be<lb/>exerted in his behalf. He thought
                            he had made a<lb/> new discovery, but was surprised when I
                            showed<lb/>him that I had brought forward a similar plan<lb/>twelve
                            years ago. I assured him, however, of my<lb/> co-operation, and he is
                            now attempting to carry his<lb/>plan into effect. If it succeeds, it
                            will be one of the<lb/>best establishments which was ever made, for
                            the<lb/>purpose of giving provident habits to the poor, and<lb/>of
                            rendering them independent of parish relief, which<lb/>adds greatly in
                            other respects to their comfort.</p>
                        <p>Having now reached the seventy-fourth year of my<lb/>age, and having
                            resolved, as soon as I can, in conse-<lb/>quence of declining health, to
                            resign all my public<lb/>laborious situations, and to devote my
                            remaining life<lb/>to charitable objects only; in the contemplation
                            of<lb/>this retirement, a friend of mine wished to possess<lb/>my
                            papers, that he might give a brief view of my<lb/>public life. This he
                            has done, and I hasten to send<lb/>you a copy of it, from which you will
                            see that I have<lb/><pb n="280" facs="SW_TE1834_277"/>not devoted any time to what is called
                                <emph rend="italic">the pleasurable<lb/>amusements of life</emph>.
                            In my progress I have encounter-<lb/>ed many difficulties, and have
                            subjected myself to<lb/>the most excessive labour, stimulated thereto by
                            a<lb/>conviction, that success would generate pleasing<lb/>reflections.
                            You too, my good sir, have pursued the<lb/>same track, perhaps in a
                            greater degree, although you<lb/> had not so wide a field: but you
                            exceed me by far,<lb/>since to charitable objects you have devoted
                            your<lb/>whole time, while mine has been occupied by a<lb/>great variety
                            of objects. I trust, however, most of<lb/>them have been useful to my
                            fellow citizens.</p>
                        <p>I had resisted the solicitations of the editor of the<lb/>European
                            Magazine, to set forth my portrait, and to<lb/>permit him to introduce
                            my biography into his work<lb/>for more than twenty years, promising at
                            the same<lb/>time, that at a future period (meaning at the close
                            of<lb/>life) I would comply with his request. I have now<lb/>redeemed
                            the pledge, and the biography now sent<lb/>you, will be found in the

                        <p>Nothing, in my opinion, will cure the excessive<lb/>evils arising from
                            the immoderate use of ardent<lb/>spirits in your country, (which is even
                            worse than<lb/>here,) than the universal diffusion of properly
                            organi-<lb/>zed <emph rend="italic">Savings Banks</emph> in each of the
                            states, sanctioned<lb/>by <emph rend="italic">legislative
                                regulations</emph>. They are calculated<lb/>beyond all other

                            the labouring people. Provident habits never fail<lb/>to generate
                            industry, and to promote moral and reli-<lb/>gious feelings. In my
                            treatise on Indigence, you<lb/>will perceive that I call it to be a

                            many useless charities, suggested<lb/>by benevolent well-meaning
                            persons, whose minds<lb/>are not sufficiently enlarged to foresee that
                            the expense<lb/>produces little practical results; while others, such

                            are unquestionable) are overlooked. Many<lb/> of the wards, in the

                            funds; and the admission<lb/>of patients, from this circumstance, is

                        <p>I wrote thee soon after thy departure from this<lb/>country, and once
                            since, and about ten days ago<lb/>received thy esteemed favour, dated,

                            intelligence of<lb/>thy safe arrival. How highly gratified I should
                            be,<lb/>by being with thee for a few months, and mixing<lb/>with that
                            kind of society, that thou wilt be constant-<lb/>ly meeting in thy tour
                            through <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>. As this is<lb/>not to
                            be my lot, it would be the next most pleasing<lb/>enjoyment, to hear
                            frequently from thee, with very<lb/>full details of thy observations on
                            men and things,<lb/>in the course of thy travels. I was much
                            pleased<lb/>with thy account of <persName key="wrosc1">William

                            have put up a large<lb/>bundle of pamphlets, amongst which are accounts of<lb/>
                            <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName key="newyo"

                                >Boston</placeName> Prisons. Such<lb/>a man, engaging with zeal in
                            the cause of humanity,<lb/>particularly as it relates to a melioration
                            of the penal<lb/>laws of Great Britain, might do wonders. To
                            effect<lb/>this, requires patience and perseverance;—the whole<lb/><pb
                                n="283" facs="SW_TE1834_280"/> work may be ruined by men, who in <placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName> are<lb/>called Oppositionists or Reformers, (in
                            America, De-<lb/>mocrats,) and who, actuated by an overstrained
                            zeal,<lb/>do not know how to take hold of things at the right<lb/>time;
                            like many religious zealots, they press on the<lb/>people more than they
                            are able to bear. The light<lb/>with which Providence has been pleased
                            to enlight-<lb/>en the minds of men, as it regards moral or
                            reli-<lb/>gious truths, is gradual—as was the commencement<lb/>of the

                                >England</placeName>, who are now engaged in endeavouring
                            to<lb/>effect an alteration in the penal system, act wisely,<lb/>they
                            will be exceedingly prudent and cautious not<lb/>to press for too much

                            hurt, owing to any<lb/>part of my conduct.</p>

                        <p>In a late letter from my particular and valuable<lb/>friend, <persName
                                key="jgris1">John Griscom</persName>, he informed me of the
                            peculiar<lb/>gratification he enjoyed in thy company at <persName
                                key="liver">Liver-<lb/>pool</persName>, and of thy being a warm
                            advocate in favour<lb/>of obtaining an alteration of your penal code,
                            and<lb/>requested me to forward thee some printed accounts<lb/>of the
                            Penitentiary system in this country. It is with<lb/>much pleasure that I
                            comply with my friends request,<lb/>and now send to care of Cropper,
                            Benson, &amp; Co., a<lb/>bundle containing several pamphlets relating to
                            our<lb/>prisons, and have added some others that I conceived<lb/>would
                            be interesting to thee. We have in this state<lb/>two large prisons, one
                            in this city that has about 750<lb/>convicts, and one at <placeName
                                key="aubur">Auburn</placeName>, (about 150 miles west<lb/>of
                                <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>,) built last year, that
                            will accommodate<lb/>about the same number. The affairs of the
                            prison<lb/>in this city have been badly managed for some years.<lb/>That
                            punishments <emph rend="italic">mild</emph> and certain will more
                            effect-<lb/>ually prevent crimes, than those which are sangui-<lb/>nary
                            and severe, there can be no doubt; and this<lb/>would have been most
                            completely verified, if the<lb/>plan of our prisons had been adapted to
                            the design<lb/>and intention of our Penitentiary system; they
                            should<lb/>have been so built, that each convict might be con-<lb/>fined
                            at night in a <emph rend="italic">separate</emph> room—say six by
                            eight<lb/> feet—but unfortunately the rooms, in all our prisons<lb/>are
                            calculated for eight to fourteen prisoners, so that<lb/>when they are
                            lodged together at night, they have<lb/>full opportunity to corrupt each
                            other, and most fre-<lb/>quently come out of prison more hardened
                            and<lb/>depraved than when they entered it. During the<lb/>day, whilst
                            employed at work, and at their meals,<lb/> as keepers are constantly
                            with them, it is very easy<lb/>to prevent them conversing with each
                            other; and if,<lb/>at night, each of them were confined in a
                            separate<lb/>room, there would be some good chance for
                            reforma-<lb/>tion; indeed, in this way the punishment would be<lb/><pb
                                n="286" facs="SW_TE1834_283"/>more severely felt, and the term of imprisonment<lb/>might
                            be shortened. I interested myself in vain<lb/>with our government, to
                            have the prison lately built<lb/>at <placeName key="aubur"
                                >Auburn</placeName>, divided throughout into rooms, to
                            accom-<lb/>modate only one prisoner; they however agreed to<lb/>have 140
                            such rooms, in order to keep separate the<lb/>most abandoned characters.
                            In a late conversation<lb/>with our Governor, he regretted very much
                            that the<lb/> prison had not been built agreeably to the
                            plan<lb/>recommended by me. I am perfectly satisfied that<lb/>until all
                            our prisons are on this plan, the expecta-<lb/>tions of those who are
                            desirous of a rational reform<lb/>will not be answered. If you should
                            succeed in<lb/>obtaining an alteration of your penal laws, it
                            would<lb/>be a fortunate circumstance, if your prisons should<lb/>be
                            calculated throughout on the plan of rooms to<lb/>lodge one person.</p>
                        <p>I inclose thee a printed copy of a paper read before<lb/>the Governors of
                            the <placeName key="newyh">New York Hospital</placeName>, in which<lb/>I

                        <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to express my<lb/>grateful
                            acknowledgments for your valuable commu-<lb/>nication of Reports and
                            Documents respecting your<lb/>state prisons and other institutions,
                            which have<lb/>arrived at a moment when they will be of
                            important<lb/>service to me, in a publication which I intend
                            short-<lb/>ly to send to press, on the state of our criminal
                            law,<lb/>and the reformation of offenders.</p>
                        <p>I have observed with great concern, the unfavoura-<lb/>ble change which
                            seems to have taken place in these<lb/><pb n="288" facs="SW_TE1834_285"/>establishments on
                            your side the Atlantic, and am<lb/>convinced, from the best
                            consideration I can give the<lb/>subject, that they are occasioned, in a
                            great degree,<lb/>by the causes mentioned in your letter—the
                            inade-<lb/>quacy of the buildings, and the want of
                            separate<lb/>apartments at night for the convicts; but,
                            independ-<lb/>ent of this, there are other circumstances
                            which<lb/>appear to me to be of great importance, and which<lb/>I intend
                            to state pretty much at large. I hope in<lb/>the course of six or eight
                            weeks to be enabled to<lb/>send you a copy of my publication, in which I
                            have<lb/>the pleasure to think you will find a close conformity<lb/>to
                            your own opinions and recommendations, so<lb/>clearly stated, and so
                            strikingly enforced, in some of<lb/>the works with which you have
                            favoured me.</p>
                        <p>I shall only at present beg leave further to observe,<lb/>that I am sorry
                            to find some indications of an inten-<lb/>tion on the part of your
                            managers, to abolish the<lb/>power of pardoning criminals, and to render
                            punish-<lb/>ment <emph rend="italic">certain</emph> as <emph

                            to me, would put an end to Penitentiary<lb/>establishments altogether.
                            That this power may<lb/>have been indiscreetly used, is possible, but it
                            is not<lb/><emph rend="italic">the sending convicts out</emph>, but the

                            He<lb/>is very desirous the Indians should remove to the<lb/>Westward,
                            and sell to him their reservations. These<lb/>Indians west of <geogName

                                >Philadelphia</placeName>, and they have<lb/>uniformly advised the

                            >Ogden</persName><lb/>prevailed on <persName key="jcalh1"
                                >Calhoun</persName> to address to him a letter<lb/>which he then
                            communicated to the Indians.</p>
                        <p>One <persName key="jhyde1">Jabez Hyde</persName>, a Presbyterian minister
                            or school-<lb/>master, residing among them, published the letter.<lb/>
                            When we met our <orgName key="pym">Friends</orgName> in <placeName
                                key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, we found<lb/>their minds much
                            soured and prejudiced against<lb/>government, and particularly against
                            the Secretary<lb/>at War; they asked, why should any confidence
                            be<lb/>placed in men who would talk so smooth to us, and<lb/>at the same
                            time write a letter, with a view to have<lb/>it shown to the Indians,
                            stating that Friends <said who="undetermined">were<lb/>their worst
                                enemies.</said> It did not serve to alter the<lb/>opinion so
                            strongly taken up by them, that we urged<lb/>our own belief, and that of
                                <persName key="tmckin1">T. McKenney</persName>, that <persName
                                key="jcalh1">Cal-<lb/>houn</persName> did not intend any way to
                            allude to Friends.<lb/>We believed, we told them, that <persName
                                key="dogde1">Ogden</persName> had stated to<lb/><persName
                                key="jcalh1">Calhoun</persName>, that a number of whites residing
                            near the<lb/>Indians, constantly urged them not to remove, and<lb/>who,
                            by trade and artifice, got from the Indians, every<lb/> year, the amount
                            of the annuities paid them by go-<lb/>vernment; and thus it became the
                            interest of this class<lb/>of people, to use every means in their power
                            to per-<lb/>suade the Indians not to remove. In making such<lb/>a
                            representation, <persName key="dogde1">Ogden</persName> induced
                                <persName key="jcalh1">Calhoun</persName> to write<lb/>this letter.
                            I am satisfied that he (<persName key="dogde1">Ogden</persName>)
                            never<lb/>mentioned to the <persName key="jcalh1">Secretary</persName>
                            that <emph rend="italic">Friends</emph> had advised<lb/>the Indians to
                            remain on their lands—it would have<lb/>been bad policy for him to have
                            urged such senti-<lb/>ments. In short, I do not believe <persName
                                key="jcalh1">Calhoun</persName> thought<lb/>of Friends when he wrote
                            the letter. It is probably<lb/><pb n="290" facs="SW_TE1834_287"/>true, that at that time,
                            government supposed it would<lb/>be for the interest of the Indians of
                                <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> to<lb/>remove to the
                            borders of the <geogName key="missi">Mississippi</geogName>; but I
                            am<lb/> well convinced they have changed their sentiments,<lb/>and that
                            now they agree most decidedly with us, that<lb/>the Indians ought to
                            remain on their reservations.</p>
                        <p>We found that <orgName key="pym">Friends</orgName>, at their last
                                <orgName key="pymsufferings">meeting for<lb/>sufferings</orgName>,

                            &amp;c., their minds seemed to<lb/>be in some degree softened—still they
                            seemed as if<lb/>they could not be reconciled to <persName key="jcalh1"

                            more, if I had not, in almost<lb/>every respect, conformed to your
                            views, and availed<lb/>myself of your excellent writings on this
                            subject,<lb/>which do the greatest credit both to yourself and
                            your<lb/>country; on which account, you will find I have not<lb/>only
                            occasionally quoted you, but have given the Re-<lb/>port of the State
                            Prison of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> for <date
                                when="1815">1815</date> (which<lb/>contains so many of your
                            excellent remarks) entire.</p>
                        <p>From the portion of my tract which relates to this<lb/>country, you will
                            perceive, that we are not insensible<lb/>to the great importance of the
                            penitentiary system,<lb/>and that some idea of such a plan has been
                            enter-<lb/>tained, even from a remote period; but <emph rend="italic"
                                >that</emph> which has<lb/>always been wanting, has been to place it
                            on a pro-<lb/>per ground, and to substitute a system of
                            benevolence<lb/>and reformation for one of revenge and punishment.</p>
                        <p>If this can be fully effected, every thing else will<lb/>naturally flow
                            from it, as from a parent stream; and<lb/>from the united efforts that
                            are making in almost<lb/>every civilized part of the world, and the free
                            com-<lb/>munication of sentiments between those who are<lb/>earnest in
                            the cause, I trust that such a foundation<lb/>will be laid for the moral
                            improvement of mankind,<lb/>as may allow us to indulge the warmest hopes
                            of a<lb/>speedy and happy result.</p>
                        <p>The publications you were so good as to send me,<lb/>were of the highest
                            value, as they show, by a variety<lb/>of experiments, not only what
                            ought to be done in<lb/>establishing a penitentiary system, but what
                            ought<lb/>to be <emph rend="italic">avoided</emph>. On this head, you
                            will see I have<lb/>expressed myself with great freedom, and will,
                            per-<lb/>haps, think I have been more ready to blame than<lb/>to
                            commend. If, however, I have written without<lb/>reserve, I have also
                            endeavoured to give reasons for<lb/>my opinions; and it would give me
                            the greatest plea-<lb/>sure, if any suggestions of mine should be
                            thought<lb/> worthy the attention of those in your country, who<lb/><pb

                        <p>I duly received thy kind favour, dated <date when="1819-02-20">20th
                                Febru-<lb/>ary</date>, accompanied with two copies of thy Treatise
                            on<lb/>Penal Jurisprudence, &amp;c., which were truly accept-<lb/>able;
                            and, from a careful perusal of the work, am<lb/>well satisfied it will
                            be extensively useful in your<lb/>country, and also in the United
                            States. I had some<lb/> expectation that an edition would have been
                            printed<lb/>here, but in this have I been disappointed. If a
                            few<lb/>copies could be sent by Robinson, bookseller, <placeName
                                key="liver">Liver-<lb/>pool</placeName>, to James Eastburn &amp;
                            Co., booksellers in this<lb/>city, they might be readily sold, and I am
                            well satis-<lb/>fied would be of great use, as they would, no
                            doubt,<lb/>be generally read by the members of our legislature,<lb/>at
                            their next session in <date when="1820-01">January</date>. The subject
                            relating<lb/>to the affairs of our penitentiary system, &amp;c.,
                            will<lb/>then be before them. The success of the establish-<lb/>ments in

                                key="virgi">Virginia</placeName>, has been equal to the<lb/>warmest
                            expectations of our friends; but, in this<lb/>state, every thing has
                            been sadly mismanaged for<lb/>some years past. In <placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsylvania</placeName>, a prison is build-<lb/>ing, calculated to
                            lodge each convict in a separate<lb/> room, and I am in hopes we shall
                            have one erected<lb/>on this plan in this state. I am satisfied, that
                            until<lb/>our prisons are all <emph rend="italic">so</emph> built, we
                            shall never have the<lb/>system pei feet. My sentiments on this are
                            fully men-<lb/>tioned in the first letter I had the pleasure of
                            address-<lb/><pb n="293" facs="SW_TE1834_290"/>ing to thee. I expect shortly a

                            years. As<lb/> soon as I get this communication, a copy shall be
                            sent<lb/>thee, and also some other materials that I expect

                            <salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I am gratified at the interest you take in our In-<lb/>dian concerns, and
                            thank you for your letter of the<lb/><date when="1819-03-03">3d
                                inst.</date>, and for the pamphlet which accompanied it.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet learned the views of the President,<lb/>respecting the
                            application of the 10,000 dollars, ap-<lb/>propriated near the close of
                            the late session of Con-<lb/>gress, to aid in the business of Indian
                            improvement.<lb/>My own opinion is, (and it is only my opinion,)
                            that<lb/>it will be applied through the benevolent agencies<lb/>which
                            are, or may be, put in operation; and at such<lb/> points as it shall be
                            likely to do the most good, ac-<lb/>cording to the intentions of the act
                            of Congress.<lb/>Those establishments, so it strikes me, will be
                            recog-<lb/>nized as most in accordance with this view, that are,<lb/> or
                            may be, organized <emph rend="italic">in the Indian country</emph>;
                            and<lb/>which embrace the two branches of improvement,<lb/>implied in
                                <emph rend="italic">letters</emph> and the <emph rend="italic"
                                >agricultural arts</emph>, united<lb/>also with a system of <emph
                                rend="italic">moral improvement</emph>. This par-<lb/>ticular
                            application, it strikes me, will be, as the sum<lb/>is, to the number of
                            Indian children taken in by<lb/>these liberal associations of men for
                            education. Thus,<lb/>if there be ten schools of instruction, for
                            example, in<lb/><pb n="294" facs="SW_TE1834_291"/>the Indian country, averaging each one
                            hundred chil-<lb/>dren, there will be one thousand dollars for
                            each<lb/>establishment.</p>
                        <p>The amount appropriated is so small, when com-<lb/>pared with the object
                            of general or universal im-<lb/>provement, that, to make it useful, it
                            can be used<lb/>only as an auxiliary to the resources which
                            indivi-<lb/>dual bounty has provided. I will just name one<lb/>school in
                            the <orgName key="cherokee">Cherokee</orgName> country, in charge of the
                            good<lb/>Mr. <persName key="gambo1">Gambold</persName>. He is labouring,
                            and has been for<lb/>fourteen years, in this generous cause; and his
                            plans<lb/>have not been developed, nor his scale of
                            usefulness<lb/>extended to its limits, for lack of pecuniary
                            resources.<lb/>Five and six children are as many as his means
                            have<lb/>ever enabled him to instruct. I don't know what his<lb/>
                            resources are, but I will suppose them to be at the<lb/>rate of fifty
                            dollars per annum for each child; and,<lb/>suppose he can educate and
                            instruct out of his own<lb/>means, in the various branches of
                            improvement which<lb/>his school embraces, only five children; and
                            suppose<lb/>it shall turn out, in the general estimate, that a
                            hun-<lb/>dred dollars can be applied, out of the 10,000
                            appro-<lb/>priated, for each child,—that would enable Mr. <persName
                                key="gambo1">Gam-<lb/>bold</persName> to take fifteen children, or
                            ten more than the<lb/>number to which, I suppose, he has been
                            hitherto<lb/> confined. I merely refer to this case, as being
                            the<lb/>first that has struck me; and to this mode of
                            illus-<lb/>tration, without knowing what plan the President<lb/>may
                            adopt. I incline to the opinion, however, that<lb/>his contemplated tour
                            may prevent him from doing<lb/>more than acquire a collection of
                            information appli-<lb/>cable to the case, against his return.</p>
                        <p> It seems you have, in the state of <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName>, 4976<lb/>Indians, and that these Indians have
                            271,323 acres of<lb/>land as reservations. I am glad they are so well
                            off<lb/>in the land way. How would it sort with your con-<lb/>venience
                            to let me know, how many schools for im-<lb/>provement are organized in
                            their settlements, exclu-<lb/>sively for Indian education? and where
                            located?—<lb/><pb n="295" facs="SW_TE1834_292"/>and how many children are attached to
                            each of them?<lb/>and, as far as you may be able, what state of
                            im-<lb/>provement they are in. In truth, my good friend, I<lb/>look to
                            the Indian <emph rend="italic">children</emph> for the realization
                            of<lb/> Indian civilization. The main efforts should be made<lb/>to
                            apply to them. The old ones are like the moun-<lb/>tain oaks, (here and
                            there some exceptions,) and it<lb/>were an almost hopeless task to
                            attempt their con-<lb/>formity with civilized life. But they must soon
                            die<lb/>off—such is nature's decree; and if vigorous measures<lb/>be
                            adopted for <emph rend="italic">the children</emph>, they will, when
                            they<lb/>arrive at maturity, appear like the vernal year, in<lb/>
                            contrast with the barrenness of a recent winter pros-<lb/>pect. My wish
                            is, that the principles of improvement<lb/>be extended to as many Indian
                            children as they can<lb/>be made to reach. They are the virgin soil—the
                            seeds<lb/>sown in them will grow, be they bad or good.</p>
                        <p>I am sure the President would be gratified to recog-<lb/>nize your
                            recommendation of agents to go amongst<lb/>the <placeName key="newyo"
                                >New York</placeName> Indians, if it shall come within
                            his<lb/>scheme to make such appointments. It is certain you<lb/>would
                            name none, but such as would promote the<lb/>great object of their
                            civilization and improvement.</p>
                        <p> The Indians at <orgName key="allegany">Allegany</orgName> and <orgName
                                key="onondaga">Onondago</orgName> are in a<lb/>fair way. They have
                            banished the greatest evil, the<lb/>small-pox not excepted, that ever
                            desolated any peo-<lb/>ple. It is literally <emph rend="italic">the
                                Indians' curse</emph>. In excluding<lb/>ardent spirits, they have
                            got the top upon Pandora's<lb/>box, and may a kind Providence help them
                            to keep<lb/> it there!</p>
                        <p>It would be gratifying all round, no doubt, to pro-<lb/>mote the views
                            embraced in your suggestions; and,<lb/>if the principle of distribution
                            shall be adopted, the<lb/><placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>
                            Indians will get, through the benevolent<lb/>channels, where I think it
                            likely it will be all made<lb/>to flow, some portion of this small sum.
                            The appoint-<lb/>ment of an agent or two, as you suggest, is a
                            good<lb/>plan; especially as the <placeName key="newyo">New
                                York</placeName> Indians are in so<lb/>many separate clans; for then
                            the agent could super-<lb/><pb n="296" facs="SW_TE1834_293"/>intend the improvement of them
                            all more generally,<lb/>by going amongst them, and counselling them
                            accord-<lb/>ing to your plan. But will it not cost an <emph
                                rend="italic">over</emph> pro-<lb/>portion of the appropriation in
                                <emph rend="italic">that</emph> direction, if $1600<lb/>be
                            necessary?—especially as these Indians are doing<lb/> so much better
                            than many others, in every way. Or<lb/>would not $1600 for 4976 Indians,
                            leave too small a<lb/>sum to go to the four nations on our borders,
                            whose<lb/>numbers may be estimated at 100,000? This may go<lb/>to show
                            the propriety of using this appropriation as<lb/>an <emph rend="italic"
                                >auxiliary</emph> to existing organizations, where its<lb/>effects
                            may tell upon a congregation of children, and<lb/>give means to increase
                            their numbers, or power to<lb/>confer additional improvements upon those
                            already<lb/> admitted. For I think (for myself) the children
                            should<lb/>be the subjects of our <emph rend="italic">special</emph>
                            care. This, however, is<lb/>not intended to exclude the Indian children
                            in <placeName key="newyo">New<lb/>York</placeName> from their proportion
                            of benefits; and hence,<lb/>I have suggested that you favour me with the
                            infor-<lb/>mation I have referred to. But all this is my own<lb/>first
                            thinking, very hastily thrown together, not one<lb/>point of which may
                            be adopted in the regulations<lb/>which shall be finally made.</p>
                        <p>I will cheerfully lay any communication you may<lb/>make on this subject
                            before the Secretary of War,<lb/> who will be the organ to the President
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I have sent after a copy of <persName key="jheck1"
                            >Heckwelder</persName>'s book. No<lb/>doubt I shall enjoy it, and derive

                        <p>I have thought much on the great subjects talked<lb/>over at our late
                            interesting and very pleasant inter-<lb/>view at your house. I have
                            since conversed with<lb/>many distinguished gentlemen in your city, on
                            board<lb/>the steam boat, and in the city of <placeName key="alban"
                                >Albany</placeName>, particu-<lb/>larly with the <persName
                                key="dclin1">Governor</persName>, <persName key="jtayl4">Lieutenant
                                Governor</persName>, and<lb/>Mr. <persName key="svanr1">Van
                                Rensselaer</persName>, (the Patroon)—all enter very<lb/>heartily
                            into our views. The <persName key="dclin1">Governor</persName>, and Mr.
                                <persName key="svanr1">Van<lb/>Rensselaer</persName>, are both going
                            in a few days to <placeName key="nycit">New<lb/>York</placeName>, on a
                            visit of several weeks. I expect to meet<lb/>them there. They will be
                            pleased to have a con-<lb/>ference with you on the subjects which
                            interests us,<lb/>and them also. The <persName key="dclin1"
                                >Governor</persName> suggested the idea of<lb/>having a meeting,
                            after my return to your city, of a<lb/>number of gentlemen, who are like
                            minded with our-<lb/>selves, and of intelligence and influence, to
                            confer on<lb/> the best measures to ripen our plans, and to
                            carry<lb/>them into effect. Mr. <persName key="svanr1">Van
                                Rensselaer</persName> will be present,<lb/>and will probably be
                            willing to go on to <placeName key="wash">Washing-<lb/>ton</placeName>
                            this winter, and aid in effecting our purposes<lb/>there, particularly
                            in forming a new association<lb/>which you suggested, of all
                            denominations, to do<lb/>every thing for the Indians, except introducing
                                <emph rend="italic">parti-<lb/>cular</emph> religious instruction.
                            This plan, I think, will<lb/>take. I think I shall make an effort to go
                            myself<lb/>to <placeName key="wash">Washington</placeName>, and hope, by
                            all means, you, my<lb/>friend, will calculate to go—and then we shall
                            feel<lb/>strong. The object is a great and good one, and<lb/>worthy a
                            great effort. It opens here very auspicious-<lb/>ly, and I am full of
                            hope.</p>
                        <p>I write after the fatigues of the day, in the bustle of<lb/>a public
                            house—but I will make no farther apology.</p>

                        <p>Thy very obliging favour of <date when="1818-06-24">June 24th,
                                1818</date>, was<lb/>received some time since, and to which I should
                            have<lb/>replied before this, but delayed, because I wished to<lb/>make
                            some communication relating to the objects<lb/>that particularly claim
                            the attention of your respecta-<lb/>ble society. Some of the prisons
                            established in Ame-<lb/>rica have not answered the expectation of the
                            advo-<lb/>cates for the penitentiary system, most of whom<lb/>were led
                            to believe, that the avails of the labour of<lb/>the convicts would be
                            sufficient to defray <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the ex-<lb/>penses
                            of their maintenance, &amp;c. This has certainly<lb/>not been the fact
                            as to the State Prison in <placeName rend="newyo">New
                            York</placeName>,<lb/>owing entirely to the appointment of persons,
                            who<lb/>have had the management of its concerns, not being<lb/>rightly
                            qualified for executing the duties required of<lb/>them. The consequence
                            of this has been, that the<lb/>expense of supporting that prison has
                            been very con-<lb/>siderable. However, considering the great
                            advan-<lb/>tage contemplated to result from the penitentiary<lb/>system,
                            the mere expense is a matter of secondary<lb/>consideration. Yet
                            experience has proved in <placeName key="newje"
                                >New<lb/>Jersey</placeName>, <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>, and <placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName>, that<lb/>under prudent direction and good
                            management, the<lb/>profits on the labour of the convicts will produce
                            suf-<lb/>ficient to pay all the necessary expenses of their
                            sup-<lb/>port, &amp;c. I think the best conducted penitentiary<lb/>we
                            have in America is at <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>. 1
                            visited that<lb/>prison a few months ago, and was highly gratified
                            in<lb/>observing the order, cleanliness, regularity, and in-<lb/>dustry
                            of the prisoners. I never visited any institu-<lb/>tion that exhibited
                            such a perfect degree of cleanli-<lb/>ness, decency, and regularity,
                            throughout its whole<lb/>concerns, as the <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>prison, the effects of which<lb/>were
                            evidently marked in the countenance and gene-<lb/> ral deportment of the
                            convicts. The present very<lb/>promising state of the <placeName
                                key="maryl">Maryland</placeName> penitentiary is ow-<lb/>ing to the
                            excellent management of their Board of In-<lb/><pb n="299" facs="SW_TE1834_296"/>spectors,
                            which is composed of gentlemen of the first<lb/>character in the city of
                                <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>. The
                            institution<lb/>is also much indebted to the judicious care and
                            good<lb/>conduct of the present keeper, who is an active
                            and<lb/>intelligent man. I requested him to send me a direct<lb/>account
                            of the expenditures, &amp;c. of the prison for the<lb/>last year, which
                            I have received from him, forward-<lb/>ed me by one of the Inspectors a
                            few days ago; and<lb/>believing that this document may be interesting
                            to<lb/>your Society, I have had it copied, and now inclose it.</p>
                        <p>There is one remark respecting the penitentiary<lb/>system, which I beg
                            leave to mention. <emph rend="italic">No</emph> benefit, as<lb/>it
                            regards <emph rend="italic">reformation</emph>, ever has been, <emph
                                rend="italic">nor ever will be</emph><lb/>produced, unless our
                            prisons are calculated to have<lb/>separate rooms, six feet by eight
                            feet, so as that every<lb/>man can be lodged <emph rend="italic">by
                                himself</emph>. If, as is common,<lb/>twelve to twenty are lodged at
                            night in one room,<lb/>they surely will corrupt each other, and leave
                            the<lb/>prison far more depraved than when they entered it.<lb/> I think
                            there is good reason to believe that our legis-<lb/>lature will direct
                            the state prison in this city to be<lb/>sold next year, and order a new
                            one to be built, to<lb/>be divided in rooms of six by eight feet each.
                            I<lb/> would further observe, that during the day, when
                            the<lb/>prisoners are employed at their work, they are, of<lb/>course,
                            constantly under the immediate eye of a<lb/>keeper, and no improper
                            intercourse or conversation<lb/> can take place. At <placeName
                                key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName>, (<placeName key="penns"
                                >Pennsylvania</placeName>,) a pri-<lb/>son, on the plan of separate
                            rooms for each convict,<lb/>is now building, and I am told they intend
                            erecting<lb/>a similar one in <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName>. Several years ago, I<lb/>mentioned to my
                            friend, <persName key="pcolq1">P. Colquhoun</persName>, of <placeName
                                key="lond">London</placeName>,<lb/>that no reformation could
                            possibly be expected from<lb/>the operation of the penitentiary system,
                            unless the<lb/>prisons were built on a plan for the convicts to be<lb/>
                            separately lodged at night, and I think he stated that<lb/>some in
                                <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> were on that construction,
                            but in<lb/>his late letters to me he is silent on the subject of
                            pri-<lb/>sons. I am told that there is a prison in the environs<lb/><pb
                                n="300" facs="SW_TE1834_297"/>of <placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, built to
                            accommodate seven hundred<lb/>prisoners, and each lodged in a room seven
                            by nine<lb/>feet. If this is a fact, I should be much gratified
                            by<lb/>having some account of it. My friend <persName key="walle1"
                                >William<lb/>Allen</persName>, some time since, wrote me that it was
                            propo-<lb/>sed to build a prison solely for lads under
                            eighteen<lb/>years of age, to be called a Reformatory, but I
                            have<lb/>not heard if this has been completed.</p>
                        <p>Our <orgName key="spaup">Society for the Prevention of
                                Pauperism</orgName>, has<lb/> appointed a committee to consider of

                            your society.</p>

                            <salute>RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>I am extremely desirous of obtaining some inform-<lb/>ation of an
                            establishment at <placeName key="avers">Aversa</placeName>, near
                                <placeName key="naple">Naples</placeName>,<lb/>which, I am told, is
                            solely for the accommodation of<lb/>Lunatics. As I have no acquaintance
                            with any per-<lb/>son residing at <placeName key="naple"
                                >Naples</placeName>, from whom I could procure<lb/>the information
                            wanted, I applied to my friend,<lb/><persName key="sgrel1">Stephen
                                Grellet</persName>, who immediately mentioned to me<lb/>thy name,
                            and stated, from his personal acquaint-<lb/>ance, he was well assured of
                            thy benevolence and<lb/>kindness, and that I might take the liberty of
                            address-<lb/>ing a letter to thee on the subject of my inquiry.
                            This,<lb/>I hope, will be kindly received, as an apology for
                            my<lb/>taking this freedom.</p>
                        <p>It is said, that the mode of treatment towards the<lb/>patients at
                                <placeName key="avers">Aversa</placeName>, is replete with tender
                            and affec-<lb/>tionate care and attention, in place of the harsh,
                            cruel,<lb/>and rigorous treatment, that has heretofore
                            been<lb/>administered towards Lunatic patients. This mode,<lb/>called
                                <said who="undetermined">moral treatment,</said> has been pursued
                            with great<lb/>success, at an Asylum called the Retreat, near <placeName
                                key="york2">York</placeName>,<lb/>(<placeName key="engl"
                                >England</placeName>,) under the care of the society of
                            Friends,<lb/>for the accommodation of the members of their
                            own<lb/>society. Near this city we have just completed a<lb/>large
                            handsome building, exclusively for Lunatics,<lb/>which will accommodate
                            more than 200 patients;<lb/> attached to it is about eighty acres of
                            land, orna-<lb/>mented with extensive gravel walks,
                            shrubberies,<lb/>gardens, green-house, &amp;c. Here it is intended
                            to<lb/>employ the patients in Horticulture and Agriculture,<lb/>also to
                            afford them every rational amusement. I<lb/>have been one of the
                            governors of the <placeName key="newyh">New
                                York<lb/>Hospital</placeName> for many years; and about four years
                            ago,<lb/>introduced to them, a proposition to establish an<lb/>Asylum
                            about six miles from the city, solely for<lb/>Lunatic Patients, on the
                            plan of <said who="undetermined">moral treatment,</said><lb/>as pursued
                            at the Retreat near <placeName key="york2">York</placeName>.</p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="SW_TE1834_300"/>
                        <p>The governors adopted the proposed plan, and<lb/>have expended on the
                            building, land, &amp;c., $150,000.<lb/>It is very desirable, that the
                            managers of this concern<lb/>should be as perfect as possible, and I am
                            therefore<lb/>induced to crave thy kind aid, in procuring for me
                            a<lb/>general and ample account respecting the establish-<lb/>ment at
                                <placeName key="avers">Aversa</placeName>; as to the general mode of
                            treating<lb/>the patients, diet, employment, &amp;c. I am very
                            fear-<lb/>ful of giving thee too much trouble, but perhaps much<lb/>may
                            be saved, if printed accounts could be procured.<lb/>They might readily
                            be translated in this city. I<lb/>have made up a package containing
                            accounts of some<lb/>of our benevolent institutions of this city.
                            Also<lb/>reports relating to the grand canal, which is intend-<lb/>ed to
                            open a communication between <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>
                            and<lb/>the <geogName key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogName>, a distance of
                            325 miles.</p>
                        <p>It is three years since this great work was com-<lb/>menced, and already
                            one hundred miles are comple-<lb/>ted; near one hundred more is this
                            year in such a<lb/>state of forwardness, that it will also be
                            completed<lb/> early next year. The whole extent, 325 miles,
                            will<lb/>probably be finished by the year <date when="1824">1824</date>.
                            The cost of<lb/>this great undertaking, (from <geogName key="lakee"
                                >Erie</geogName> to the <geogName key="hudsr"
                            >Hudson</geogName>)<lb/> will be about five millions of dollars. I send
                            thee a<lb/>small map, which will serve to show the route of
                            the<lb/>canal.</p>
                        <p>There are three American young gentlemen who<lb/>expect to visit
                                <placeName key="naple">Naples</placeName> next spring; <persName

                            thou<lb/> mayest have for America. Any attention shown by<lb/>thee to

                                <persName key="jplat1">Judge<lb/>Platt</persName> one evening at
                                <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, in <date when="1810"
                                >1810</date>, and mentioned<lb/>to him the propriety of proposing to
                            the legislature,<lb/>to appoint commissioners to explore the country
                            as<lb/>far west as the <geogName key="senec">Seneca Lake</geogName>, and
                            to report their<lb/>opinion, how far it was practicable to connect that

                            would be<lb/> made, and that, considering the immense advantage<lb/>that
                            would result to the state by such an undertaking,<lb/>there could be no
                            doubt the legislature would readily<lb/>be induced to adopt the
                            plan.</p>
                        <p><persName key="jplat1">Judge Platt</persName> was at this time a member
                            of the Sen-<lb/>ate, and being well acquainted with the geography<lb/>of
                            the state, readily agreed with me in sentiment,<lb/>but he remarked,
                            that if commissioners were appoint-<lb/>ed, they ought to be directed to
                            explore and examine<lb/>the country as far as <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                                Erie</geogName>, to ascertain if it was<lb/>practicable, to connect

                                River</geogName>. I replied, that I was fear-<lb/>ful the
                            legislature would be deterred from making any<lb/>appointment of
                            commissioners, if so great an under-<lb/>taking should be proposed, and
                            that by proposing for<lb/>them to examine the country only as far as the
                                <geogName key="senec">Sene-<lb/>ca Lake</geogName>, they might then
                            be induced to adopt the<lb/>measure. After some farther conversation, it
                            was<lb/> agreed to propose going as far as <geogName key="lakee">Lake

                            <persName key="jplat1">Judge Platt</persName> immediately drafted a

                        <p>The reasons which prevented me from doing more<lb/>than merely
                            acknowledging your kind letter of <date when="1820-09">Sep-<lb/>tember
                                last</date>, and thanking you for the valuable col-<lb/>lection of
                            pamphlets which accompanied it, have<lb/>continued ever since I wrote;
                            but being now (as you<lb/>will perceive by the enclosure) seriously at
                            work in<lb/>the formation of a criminal code for this state, I am<lb/>
                            extremely anxious to receive the report of your com-<lb/>mittee on the
                            penitentiary system; from which I<lb/>have a right to expect so much
                            important informa-<lb/>tion, I hope you will not fail to forward a copy
                            to<lb/>me as soon as it appears.</p>
                        <p>I regret very much, that for the reasons I formerly<lb/>stated, I could
                            not contribute any thing to the work.</p>
                        <p>Unless I hear reasons much stronger than any<lb/>which have been
                            presented to me, either by reading,<lb/>conversation, or reflection, I
                            shall not give the pun-<lb/>ishment of death a place in the code which I
                            shall<lb/>present; it appears to me to be a most inefficient
                            pun-<lb/>ishment, to say nothing of its irremediable nature;<lb/><pb
                                n="308" facs="SW_TE1834_305"/> almost all writers on the subject, join in a degree
                            to<lb/>acknowledge this, and yet almost all recommend it<lb/>for some
                            offences; this I cannot understand, unless it<lb/>be the effect of a
                            vindictive sensation against atro-<lb/>cious crimes, which ought not to
                            be indulged in legis-<lb/>lation.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to find, that an opinion of the ineffica-<lb/>cy of the
                            penitentiary system is gaining ground, and<lb/>should be still more
                            grieved if I thought it well<lb/>founded; but I do not, and am inclined
                            to think, that<lb/>all the great defects in the system, arise from
                            parsi-<lb/>mony in preparing the establishments. If the build-<lb/>ings
                            were sufficiently spacious, the prisoners might<lb/>be classed, and
                            reformation reasonably expected,<lb/>instead of the corruption which
                            indiscriminate con-<lb/>finement produces; and injudicious pardons of
                            old<lb/>offenders need not be given to make room for
                            new<lb/>convicts;—if they were sufficiently solid and strong,<lb/>the
                            hope of escape would never be indulged or reali-<lb/>zed—but to erect
                            spacious and strong buildings<lb/> requires large funds, and it is
                            easier to condemn a<lb/>whole system, than to lay taxes to execute it.
                            I<lb/>trust, however, that a fair experiment will be made<lb/>in
                                <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>; there, if any where, we
                            must look for<lb/>enlarged views and useful institutions.</p>
                        <p>As it is not very probable that I shall ever return<lb/>to my native
                            city, my desire to live in the remem-<lb/>brance of my friends there has
                            become more import-<lb/>ant to me; among them I have always counted
                            you,<lb/> and hope you will still allow me to do so.</p>

                            will answer the ex-<lb/>pectations of the promoters of it.</p>
                        <p>I am extremely sorry, that my absence from<lb/>

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p><persName key="wburl1">William S. Burling</persName> lately solicited me
                            to recom-<lb/>mend to our friend <persName key="colv1"
                            >Colven</persName>, the introduction of a plan<lb/>for laying an excise
                            on spirituous liquors, and I part-<lb/>ly promised him that I would; but
                            on further reflec-<lb/>tion, I consider it most suitable that the
                            overture<lb/> should emanate from his constituents, and with
                            this<lb/>view I now write to you.</p>
                        <p>In some well written essays, published on this sub-<lb/>ject in Walsh's
                            paper, it was estimated that fifty<lb/>millions of gallons of spirituous
                            liquors are annually<lb/>consumed in the United States, at an expense
                            of<lb/> thirty millions of dollars, and with the sacrifice of<lb/>thirty
                            thousand lives. If this be only an approxima-<lb/>tion to the truth,
                            what a field for reflection does it<lb/>open to the moralist and the
                            statesman.</p>
                        <pb n="310" facs="SW_TE1834_307"/>
                        <p>After deducting foreign importations of spirits, say<lb/>to the amount of
                            six millions of gallons, and allow-<lb/>ing for four millions produced
                            from foreign molasses,<lb/>there would still remain forty millions of
                            gallons<lb/>manufactured from our own materials. Does not<lb/>this
                            astound us with its enormity, and alarm us with<lb/>its terrific
                            aspect!</p>
                        <p>An excise of one shilling a gallon, would produce<lb/>a revenue of five
                            millions of dollars a year. Double<lb/>the duty, and you will raise a
                            fund that will pay<lb/> off the national debt, and line and intersect
                            the<lb/>country in all directions with canals and roads.</p>
                        <p>Every considerable increase in the price of any<lb/>article, tends to
                            check its consumption. And hence,<lb/>the revenue of the country would
                            be an auxiliary to<lb/>its morality—a noble union in the eye of a
                            great<lb/>statesman.</p>

                        <p>I am particularly obliged by thy kind attention,<lb/>in sending me a copy

                            would be<lb/> highly useful in this country, it is intended to

                            <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
                        <p>It is with sincere pleasure that I avail myself of<lb/>the present
                            opportunity, to transmit you a copy of<lb/>the third and last part of my
                            observations on penal<lb/>jurisprudence, which is now ready for
                            publication<lb/> here, and in which I have endeavoured, to the
                            best<lb/>of my power, to recommend to my countrymen an<lb/>improved
                            system of reformatory discipline, similar to<lb/>that adopted in the
                            United States of America, and in<lb/>the establishment of which you have
                            had so import-<lb/>ant a share. I do this with the feelings of a
                            disciple,<lb/>who looks up to his master for the approbation of<lb/>his
                            labours—there being no person living, whose<lb/>ideas on this subject I
                            more implicitly adopt, than<lb/>your own. </p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="SW_TE1834_311"/>
                        <p> Within these few days, and after my work was<lb/>printed and ready for
                            publication, I have received<lb/>from <persName key="shopk1">Mr.
                                Hopkins</persName>, one of the commissioners appoint-<lb/>ed by the
                            legislature last year, to examine and report<lb/>on the state of the
                            prisons at <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>, their
                            report<lb/>on that subject, which has given me more surprise<lb/>and
                            concern than I can express, as it appears to me<lb/>to recommend an
                            entire abandonment of the reform-<lb/>atory system, and the introduction
                            of a plan of<lb/>compulsory labour, more severe than any that
                            has<lb/>ever yet been proposed. On the receipt of this docu-<lb/>ment, I
                            lost no time in drawing up a few remarks<lb/>upon it, with the view
                            certainly, but scarcely with<lb/>the hope, that if they should arrive
                            before the passing<lb/>of the proposed act, they might have some effect
                            in<lb/>strengthening the opposition which will, I trust, be<lb/>made,
                            for preventing, or at least modifying, the<lb/>measures proposed. Of
                            these I send you a few copies,<lb/>entreating you to put them into the
                            hands of such of<lb/>your friends, as you may think proper; as it is
                            my<lb/>decided opinion, that if the system now proposed<lb/>should be
                            adopted, the United States of America will<lb/>forfeit their chief
                            glory, and will be as remarkable<lb/>for the cruelty of their penal
                            code, as they have<lb/>hitherto been for their enlightened humanity.</p>
                        <p>In the hope of hearing from you on this most inte-<lb/>resting subject,
                            and of learning that you continue to<lb/>enjoy a good state of health, I
                            remain, with the most<lb/> sincere attachment and affectionate

                            <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
                        <p>Thy very kind and acceptable favour of <date when="1825-03-31"
                                >31st<lb/>March</date>, came to hand some time ago, and I feel not
                            a<lb/> little mortified that it has remained so long
                            without<lb/>acknowledging its receipt; and also thy last
                            publica-<lb/>tion on penal jurisprudence which accompanied
                            it,<lb/>together with remarks on the report of the commis-<lb/>sioners,
                            and the verses on solitary confinement, with<lb/>which I was very much
                            delighted.</p>
                        <p>Though the state of society of latter years has been<lb/>greatly
                            improved, yet daily experience teaches us,<lb/>that we are very far from
                            that degree of perfection<lb/>on various subjects, we are capable of
                            attaining; the<lb/>work goes on slowly, and mostly imperceptibly
                            to<lb/>all human observation; we may, however, rest assu-<lb/>red, that
                            all principles and practices, no matter how<lb/>long they have been
                            continued and supported by<lb/><pb n="316" facs="SW_TE1834_313"/>deep rooted prejudices,
                            founded on the blindness and<lb/>wickedness of our species, that are
                            clearly contrary<lb/>to the laws of God and our own reason, will
                            come<lb/>to an end. The slave trade, and the general aboli-<lb/>tion of
                            slavery, is a striking proof in support of this<lb/> sentiment. It is
                            now almost certain that the trade,<lb/>and slavery itself, will not
                            exist many years longer.<lb/>Equally against the laws of God and right
                            reason, are<lb/>all laws relating to crimes and punishments,
                            enacted<lb/> on the principles of a vindictive spirit; such laws
                            are<lb/>calculated frequently to violate common justice, and<lb/>all
                            distinctions of morality, and, in many cases, tend<lb/>to debase the
                            mind, and by the undue severity<lb/> they inflict, aim to make fear the
                            motive of obedi-<lb/>ence:—in short, these laws are more calculated
                            for<lb/>slaves than freemen, and seem intended to
                            punish<lb/>delinquents, rather than to prevent crimes. It is true,<lb/>a
                            course of improvement has been commenced of<lb/>latter years, which
                            claim the approbation of the just<lb/>and the sanction of the wise, but
                            no radical reform<lb/>can take place, until the public mind is more
                            fully<lb/>convinced of the absurdity and wickedness of vindic-<lb/>tive
                            punishment. In proportion as this evil governs<lb/>our public laws, so
                            the difficulty is increased in form-<lb/>ing wholesome laws for the
                            support of prison disci-<lb/>pline, calculated for the government and
                            reformation<lb/>of convicts. I am exceedingly mortified to find
                            that<lb/>my friend <persName key="clynd1">Captain Lindes</persName>,
                            keeper of <placeName key="aubur">Auburn</placeName>
                            prison,<lb/>advocates (and practices) inflicting corporeal
                            punish-<lb/>ment, for violating any part of the prison discipline.<lb/>I
                            the more regret that this man should entertain such<lb/>sentiments,
                            because, on the general subject of penal<lb/>jurisprudence, and the
                            government of a penitentiary,<lb/>I esteem him superior to almost any
                            other man that<lb/>I ever conversed with:—he formerly was in the
                            army,<lb/>and had only had the advantage of a good common<lb/>education,
                            but possesses a good share of understand-<lb/>ing, great integrity, an
                            amiable disposition, and an<lb/> extensive knowledge of human nature, as
                            regards<lb/><pb n="317" facs="SW_TE1834_314"/>the middle and lower classes of society. As
                            a discipli-<lb/>narian, it would be difficult to find his equal;
                            owing<lb/>to his superior management of the convicts, under<lb/>his
                            charge. They love and fear him—they regard<lb/>him as their friend and
                            protector—he furnishes them<lb/>with plenty of good wholesome
                            provisions—keeps<lb/>them constantly employed, but never imposes
                            immo-<lb/>derate tasks on them—he holds no conversation with<lb/>them
                            except in directing their work, and this course<lb/>is strictly pursued
                            by all his subordinate keepers—<lb/>he disdains the idle notion, that
                            extreme severity is<lb/>the only appropriate mode for the government of
                            a<lb/>penitentiary. I never conversed with a person,<lb/>whose
                            sentiments as respects the management of<lb/>convicts, so cordially met
                            my views, and in my opi-<lb/>nion are so well calculated to promote
                            their general<lb/>welfare, and produce reformation. It is my
                            opinion,<lb/>that there is no prison in the world equal to
                            Auburn<lb/>prison, as regards cleanliness, industry, and good<lb/>
                            conduct. The rules and regulations of the prison<lb/>are made known to
                            each convict, and the moment<lb/>any of them are violated, the offender
                            is punished—<lb/>it is owing to the certainty of this, that it is
                            very<lb/>rare any punishment is inflicted. I perfectly agree<lb/>with
                            him in every particular he advances, except as<lb/>to the mode of
                            punishment adopted by him. I have<lb/> in vain urged to him, that
                            whipping is totally incon-<lb/>sistent with the principles of that mild
                            system we<lb/>wish to establish. I cannot persuade him, that
                            prompt<lb/>punishment, by confinement, in a solitary cell on<lb/>bread
                            and water, will produce the same effects as<lb/>whipping. I allow he
                            will not exercise this power<lb/>unless accompanied with a degree of
                            justice, as to<lb/>the nature of the offence committed, but
                            certainly<lb/>others may abuse it, and therefore it never ought
                            to<lb/>be allowed in any prison. I have told him that<lb/>during several
                            years, that the <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> state
                            prison<lb/>was subject to my direction as one of its
                            inspectors,<lb/>there never was a single instance of inflicting
                            corpo-<lb/><pb n="318" facs="SW_TE1834_315"/>real punishment, and yet perfect order was
                            complete-<lb/>ly preserved. He, however, persists in his
                            notion,<lb/>that it is impossible to preserve order without
                            whip-<lb/>ping. I am firm in the belief, that <persName key="clynd1"
                                >Captain Lindes</persName><lb/>will, in time, alter his opinions. He
                            is a complete<lb/>enthusiast in favour of the penitentiary system,
                            and<lb/>has those peculiar qualifications, that will enable<lb/>him to
                            carry it to a degree of perfection that it has<lb/>never yet attained.
                            The quietness of the prisoners<lb/>subject to his care and management is
                            much to be<lb/>admired. Some months ago, in company with our<lb/>mutual
                            friend, <persName key="jgris1">Professor Griscom</persName>, I visited
                                <placeName key="sings">Sing Sing</placeName>,<lb/>situated on the
                                <geogName key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogName>, about thirty miles
                                from<lb/><placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>. At this place
                            is erecting a state prison,<lb/>within a hundred yards of the margin of
                            the river—<lb/>the banks are about one hundred feet high, and
                            con-<lb/>tain large and extensive marble quarries, of
                            excellent<lb/>quality, which is excavated, and hammered, and<lb/>formed
                            for the building, which will contain eight<lb/>hundred cells;—the state
                            has purchased about one<lb/>hundred and fifty acres of fine land
                            adjoining the<lb/>building—the erecting the prison is committed
                            solely<lb/>to the care and management of <persName key="clynd1">Captain
                                Lindes</persName>—the<lb/>plan is his own, and, in my opinion, the
                            best in the<lb/>world. The flooring, ceiling, and sides of each
                            cell,<lb/>are entirely of marble, and the doors iron. He has<lb/>with
                            him one hundred and thirty convicts, which he<lb/>brought from
                                <placeName key="aubur">Auburn</placeName> prison—besides these, he
                            has<lb/>one master carpenter, one mason, and one black-<lb/>smith—<emph
                                rend="italic">no other persons except convicts are
                            employed</emph>;—<lb/>he commenced last spring, and next year the
                            work<lb/> will probably be completed. There is no wood used<lb/>in
                            building this prison—it is all of stone. Convicts<lb/>are employed in
                            quarrying, burning lime, (from mar-<lb/>ble,) forming the stone, mason
                            work, and making<lb/>iron doors for the cells, &amp;c. The whole cost of
                            the<lb/>building will not exceed $75,000, about £16,500 ster-<lb/>ling.
                            The decent order and conduct of the convicts<lb/>is wonderful; they are
                            allowed plenty of beef and<lb/><pb n="319" facs="SW_TE1834_316"/>pork, and excellent bread,
                            but no other drink than<lb/>good water; those employed as smiths never
                            work-<lb/>ed at the trade till they came to <placeName key="sing">Sing
                                Sing</placeName>, and the<lb/>neatness and excellence of their work
                            in making the<lb/>doors and locks for the cells, are really
                            astonishing.<lb/>The mason work appears to be done in the best
                            man-<lb/>ner—the men all have a chain about fifteen pounds.<lb/>Their
                            first work was to erect sheds with pine boards,<lb/>to lodge in at
                            night; they are not allowed to speak<lb/>to each other, of course, the
                            whole work is quietly<lb/>conducted, without the least noise or
                            confusion; they<lb/>have enjoyed remarkable good health, and though<lb/>
                            the summer was uncommonly hot, and they had to<lb/>work exposed to the
                            sun, yet, I think, only two have<lb/>been sick; they never missed
                            working every day, and<lb/>but one has escaped. Six men, each with a
                            musket,<lb/>are stationed at equal distances from each
                            other—the<lb/>river in the front, serves also to prevent an
                            escape.<lb/>When the prison is finished, all the convicts in
                                the<lb/><placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> state prison in
                            this city, about five to six<lb/>hundred, are to be removed, and it is
                            intended to<lb/>employ them in making lime, and preparing marble<lb/>in
                            various ways to be transported to the city, to be<lb/>used for purposes
                            of ornament, building, &amp;c. The<lb/>work is admirably calculated to
                            promote good health,<lb/> and so simple, that every man can be employed;
                            all<lb/>the marble they can send to this city, and to <placeName
                                key="alban">Albany</placeName>,<lb/>and other places on the
                                <geogName key="hudsr">Hudson River</geogName>, will meet<lb/>with an
                            immediate sale, and considerable will be<lb/>exported to the Southern
                            states. Order, and conse-<lb/>quently the important work of reformation,
                            will be<lb/>far more certain, than if various trades were
                            pursued.<lb/>And here, permit me to observe, that I think
                            thy<lb/>remark, that each convict should learn some trade,<lb/>does not
                            apply to this country so much as it may to<lb/>
                            <placeName key="engl">England</placeName>. Some of our convicts have
                            been brought<lb/>up to trades, but most of them have been
                            employed<lb/>at farming and as labourers. If they are willing
                            to<lb/>work, they may readily get employment in the city<lb/><pb n="320" facs="SW_TE1834_317"/>as labourers, or in the country as farmers. I agree<lb/>with thee in
                            most of the sentiments contained in thy<lb/>private remarks, and have
                            handed a copy to the lead-<lb/>ing members of our legislature, who, I
                            know, are<lb/>heartily disposed to improve our penal code,
                            and<lb/>establish the mildest penitentiary system. I have<lb/>the
                            fullest confidence, that the most objectionable<lb/>parts of the
                            commissioners report will not be adopt-<lb/>ed; and, in time, I am
                            satisfied, that confinement in<lb/>cells, on bread and water, for breach
                            of prison disci-<lb/>pline, will be practised instead of corporeal
                            punish-<lb/>ment. The public feeling, and the principles of com-<lb/>mon
                            sense, will prevail, and do away the deep rooted<lb/>prejudices of our
                            public legislation—the work is slow,<lb/>but sure. My friend <persName
                                key="shopk1">Hopkins</persName>, whose character is<lb/>known to
                            thee, is a good man, but the report of the<lb/> commissioners serves to
                            prove, that he has some very<lb/>incorrect notions respecting the
                            penitentiary system;<lb/>however, I believe his mind is now got to be
                            more<lb/>enlightened on the subject. My particular and inti-<lb/>mate
                            friend, <persName key="ccold1">Cadwallader D. Colden</persName>, an
                            eminent<lb/>lawyer, and formerly mayor of this city, and now
                            a<lb/>member of the <orgName key="nysen">Senate</orgName> of this state,
                            has been closely<lb/>united with me for many years, in endeavours
                            for<lb/>the improvement of our penal laws and penitentiary<lb/>system.
                            He has been uniformly most decided in his<lb/>sentiments in favour of
                            the great object we have in<lb/>view; and I have full confidence in his
                            judgment,<lb/>zeal, and attention to any legislative business,
                            that<lb/>may be introduced in the course of the present
                            win-<lb/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The prison building in <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> to
                            accommo-<lb/>date six hundred convicts, will be finished next
                            year,<lb/>and will cost five times as much as ours at <placeName
                                key="sings">Sing Sing</placeName>,<lb/>which will have eight hundred
                            cells. Their plan is,<lb/>that a convict sentenced for three, four, or
                            five years,<lb/>shall, during the whole period of his sentence, be
                            con-<lb/>fined in his cell, at some kind of work; this, they
                            say,<lb/>will produce complete reformation, and they are so
                            fixed<lb/><pb n="321" facs="SW_TE1834_318"/>in their opinions of the superior efficacy of
                            this plan,<lb/>that it is in vain to urge to them that it is cruel
                            and<lb/>impolitic. The projectors of this plan, are my par-<lb/>ticular
                            friends, of the first rank and respectability in<lb/>the city of
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. I have no doubt but
                            the<lb/>experience of one year will convince them of
                            their<lb/>error.</p>
                        <p>I cannot be reconciled to think myself deserving<lb/>thy very handsome
                            compliment, in attributing to me<lb/>having an important share in the
                            establishment of<lb/>the reformatory system in this country; the
                            chief<lb/>credit is due that truly wise and good man, <persName

                            Every time<lb/>I visit <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName>, I am
                            fully convinced that the conti-<lb/>guity of our settlements is

                            men, and<lb/>that therefore their only salvation lies in removal
                            to<lb/>a distance. I have, however, never authorized
                            any<lb/>communication through <persName key="jparr2">Captain

                        <p>All travellers agree, that in the ratio of their dis-<lb/>tance from the

                    fatigue of writing<lb/>a single page with his own hand. It came from a<lb/>mind
                    about to depart to a better world, but which<lb/>then reflected the images of
                    virtue, sentiment, and<lb/>affection, as purely as it did in the prime of his
                    exist-<lb/>ence. In the soul of <persName key="wrosc1">Roscoe</persName> there
                    was no sediment;<lb/>the last rays of the lamp of life were redolent of
                    taste<lb/>and poesy. There was no envy, no aversion, no<lb/>repinings breathed
                    from his lips, and his criticisms<lb/>have the weight of truth and sincerity,
                    which can<lb/>only flow from a pure and exalted spirit. Praise<lb/>from such a
                    man, under such circumstances, can<lb/>never be forgotten. I could not contract
                    this letter.<lb/>I had no right to do it.</p>

                        <opener>MY DEAR SIR,</opener>
                        <p>Some time previous to the receipt of the letter<lb/>with which you
                            honoured me, dated the <date when="1829-04-29">29th
                                April,<lb/>1829,</date> and accompanying the present of your

                                Clinton</persName>, I had an attack of<lb/>paralysis, which had
                            interfered with my usual occu-<lb/><pb n="323" facs="SW_TE1834_320"/>pations, and for some
                            time interrupted my correspon-<lb/>dence ; and, although by the blessing
                            of God, and by<lb/>the aid of repeated depletion, and powerful
                            reme-<lb/>dies, I have been restored to such a state of health as<lb/>to
                            be able to devote a prescribed portion of my time<lb/>to the society of
                            my friends and the perusal of my<lb/>books, a result at my time of life
                            (approaching my<lb/>78th year) scarcely to be expected ; yet it has not
                            been<lb/>till of late that I have been able to undertake the<lb/>perusal
                            of so large a work as yours, which I have<lb/>now read, not only without
                            any injurious conse-<lb/>quences to my health, but with great
                            information<lb/>and amusement. At the same, time I have imbibed<lb/>a
                            very distinct idea and favourable opinion of the<lb/>truly great and
                            good man, whose character you have<lb/>so admirably depicted, and whose
                            great and various<lb/>merits you have so ably illustrated and
                            explained.<lb/>Writing, as I now do, under the immediate
                            impres-<lb/>sions derived from the perusal of your noble tribute<lb/>to
                            the memory of your friend, it would be unjust in<lb/>me to suppress the
                            feelings with which I have been<lb/>actuated, or to deny that, highly as
                            I estimate such a<lb/> character in a nation abounding in great men, I
                            con-<lb/>sider your production as having shown you worthy<lb/>to have
                            been his biographer, and whilst you have<lb/>raised an imperishable
                            monument to his fame, to<lb/>have given the surest earnest of your own.
                            In addi-<lb/>tion to the regret I feel, in not having been able
                            to<lb/>reply sooner to your letter, 1 am sorry not to
                            have<lb/>transmitted you the few documents requested by
                            you,<lb/>respecting my late highly esteemed friend, <persName
                                key="teddy1">Thomas<lb/>Eddy</persName>, of whom I have read several
                            very interesting<lb/>memorials in your work; but the same calamity
                            that<lb/> prevented me from writing, also prevented me
                            from<lb/>performing this duty, having taken me when my<lb/>papers were
                            in such a state of derangement that they<lb/>could not, for a long time,
                            be looked into. I am, how-<lb/>ever, in some degree, consoled by the
                            consideration,<lb/>that you will not have been delayed in your
                            intend-<lb/><pb n="324" facs="SW_TE1834_321"/>ed account of <persName key="teddy1">Mr.
                                Eddy</persName>, by my apparent negligence;<lb/>my correspondence
                            with him being only occasional,<lb/> and extending to little more than
                            the interchange of<lb/>new publications, although I always entertained
                            a<lb/>very high opinion both of his benevolence and his<lb/>literary
                            talents. As the indisposition to which I<lb/> have referred, attacked me
                            at a lime when I was en-<lb/>gaged in a debate with some of your
                            countrymen,<lb/>on the subject of prison discipline, my medical
                            friends<lb/>advised me, for a time, not to enter again upon that<lb/>
                            subject, and it is only of late that I have been able to<lb/>have the
                            satisfaction of hearing of the system of dis-<lb/>cipline recently
                            established at <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>;
                            whence,<lb/>for many years, I have been led to expect the adop-<lb/>tion
                            of the horrid punishment of solitary confinement,<lb/> without
                            permitting the convicts to labour; with<lb/>which view, the legislature
                            has erected two large and<lb/>expensive prisons, intending to confine
                            the criminals<lb/>in such a manner that they should be separated,
                            not<lb/>only by night but by day, and should be deprived of<lb/>the
                            liberty of working, lest it should be an allevia-<lb/>tion of their
                            suffering. Against this inhuman and<lb/>unchristian-like system, my
                            humble voice has been<lb/> raised, amongst those of many others of more
                            impor-<lb/>tance, for several years past; but it is only a few<lb/>weeks
                            since that I have learnt, by a communication<lb/>of authentic documents
                            from <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, that the<lb/>
                            legislature have at length given way to the feelings<lb/>of humanity,
                            and have determined that the convicts<lb/>shall be allowed to labour in
                            the day, and shall be<lb/>instructed for that purpose, as well as in
                            whatever<lb/>else may be requisite for their reformation.
                            The<lb/>commissioners, whom the legislature had appointed<lb/>to
                            consider and report to them on this subject, had,<lb/>indeed,
                            recommended to them, in their report, that<lb/>the convicts should be
                            permitted to labour in compa-<lb/>nies, under proper restriction; but
                            with this the legis-<lb/>lature would not comply, which I cannot but
                            greatly<lb/>regret; although I cannot but rejoice, at the same<lb/><pb
                                n="325" facs="SW_TE1834_322"/>time, that so much has been accomplished; consider-<lb/>ing
                            the object of labour, or no labour, as being, in fact,<lb/>the only
                            question in debate, and being of opinion,<lb/>for various reasons, that
                            the legislature will be<lb/>obliged to resort to the plan recommended by
                            their<lb/> commissioners. By this decision, I conceive the
                            great<lb/>question of prison discipline, as far as regards
                            the<lb/>United States, is finally settled; every other place,<lb/>except
                                <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, already adopted
                            that plan, there-<lb/>by making crime to counteract itself, and repair,
                            as<lb/>far as possible, the evils it has occasioned. In no<lb/>country
                            has this principle been so well understood,<lb/>or carried so far, as in
                            your own, and the relinquish-<lb/>ment of it for the Bastile system of
                            solitary confine-<lb/>ment, would have grieved me more than I can
                            express;<lb/>but, thank God, my dread of that is over; and I
                            shall<lb/>now die in peace, convinced that the time will arrive<lb/>when
                            my own country will follow the example.</p>
                        <p>You will not be surprised to hear that our canal<lb/>navigations, which
                            have hitherto been very produc-<lb/>tive, are depreciated by the
                            completion of our rail-<lb/>way from <placeName key="liver"

                                to<lb/><placeName key="lond">London</placeName>, and by several
                            others in different parts of<lb/>the kingdom; but our small dykes bear
                            no propor-<lb/>tion to your magnificent aqueducts, which, I
                            suppose,<lb/>set all competition from railways at defiance.</p>

                        >Mr. Eddy</persName> lost his son,<lb/>
                    <persName key="jeddy1">John Hartshorne Eddy</persName>. He died in the 34th year
                    of<lb/>his age. He was a remarkable young man. At the<lb/>age of twelve years,
                    he lost his hearing from the<lb/>scarlet fever; he had then only the common
                    and<lb/>ordinary instruction of a boy of that age. On his<lb/>recovery, he
                    discovered an ardent desire for know-<lb/>ledge, and commenced with zeal the
                    process of self-<lb/>instruction, and that so successfully, that, at
                    eighteen,<lb/>he was far advanced in polite literature, having ac-<lb/>quired a
                    good knowledge of the Latin and French<lb/>languages. He was accomplished in
                    drawing, botany<lb/>painting, and poetry; and, at the same time,
                    pursued,<lb/>with assiduity his mathematical studies. We have<lb/>known more
                    than one instance, in which the misfor-<lb/>tune of deafness has given new
                    acuteness and energy<lb/>to the mind. The restlessness that generally
                    attends<lb/>this misfortune, drives the mind to examine its own<lb/>resources,
                    and to weigh its own powers; and it is<lb/>astonishing how much can be done,
                    when we are<lb/>obliged to do it, either by motives of
                    advancement,<lb/>ambition, or necessity; and no necessity is stronger<lb/>than
                    that of preventing the mind from preying upon<lb/>itself. The paintings of young
                        <persName key="jeddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> showed taste<lb/>and skill, but
                    he did not choose to follow the art as<lb/>a profession; it had too much to do
                    with others to<lb/><pb n="327" facs="SW_TE1834_324"/>satisfy him. He painted only for amusement.
                    He<lb/> loved poetry in early life, for it gave him an oppor-<lb/>tunity of
                    pouring out his feelings without disguise;<lb/>but he found, at a later period,
                    how much excitement<lb/> it costs to make images from nature and truth,
                    to<lb/>bathe them in the purest blood of the heart, and<lb/>then to send them
                    out to a cold, critical world. At<lb/>length, he, in a good measure, gave up his
                    muse, and<lb/>devoted his time to the sciences. In the pursuit
                    of<lb/>mathematics, geometry, astronomy, and topography,<lb/>there are no throes
                    or agonies, and but few difficulties<lb/>of any kind in the pathway. To these
                    studies he<lb/>gave almost undivided attention. In this almost<lb/>pure
                    abstraction, the memory is not busy, and the<lb/>heart is still. He pursued his
                    scientific course several<lb/>years; and, for exercise and amusement, he
                    made<lb/>topographical surveys in every part of the state of<lb/><placeName
                        key="newyo">New York</placeName>, and drew several maps. His large
                    map<lb/>of the state, the best that had ever been drawn of it,<lb/>was published
                    the year after his death, but it was in<lb/>the hands of the engraver before his
                    decease. In his<lb/> tour of topographical surveying, he improved
                    his<lb/>knowledge of botany, for there was nothing painful<lb/>in this science;
                    for, while the flower and herb give<lb/>delight to the senses, they are subjects

                                <persName key="jrile1">Captain<lb/>Riley</persName> has, indeed,
                            been pronounced a loose writer by<lb/>an anonymous reviewer; but the

                            be-<lb/>sides, he is subject to the evidence of living witnesses.<lb/>It
                            cannot be denied, that his work contains most<lb/>important views of

                        <p>Enough has been said to show, that the strongest<lb/>principle of action
                            in <persName key="jeddy1">John H. Eddy</persName>, was the
                            laud-<lb/>able desire to be useful; that he was superior to<lb/>making a
                            trade of liberal pursuits, and generous in<lb/>pecuniary matters, is
                            admitted by those to whom he<lb/>was best known. To conclude this hasty
                            sketch, it<lb/>is unfortunately too frequently our lot, to lament
                            the<lb/> seemingly untimely departure of aspiring genius and<lb/>worth;
                            but it may confidently be said, seldom could<lb/>our regret and
                            lamentation be more feelingly be-<lb/>stowed, than on the subject of
                            this brief memorial.<lb/>Time and talents have rarely been more

                            objects of substan-<lb/>tial importance; and it is painful to reflect,
                            that his<lb/>fatal illness was prematurely induced, in
                            consequence<lb/>of such exertions. Let the qualities of his heart
                            and<lb/>his moral excellence command our regard; for the<lb/>services he
                            has rendered, let the debt of gratitude be<lb/>paid to his memory.

                            queries<lb/>were prepared by the late <persName key="jeddy1">John H.
                                Eddy</persName>, of this city.<lb/>He had them printed in the form
                            of a circular, and a<lb/>number of copies were sent to various gentlemen
                            in<lb/> different parts of the country to which they relate.<lb/>Few
                            communications, however, were received in<lb/>reply; and the multiplied
                            avocations of <persName key="jeddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName><lb/>compelled
                            him to postpone the prosecution of his<lb/>inquiries to a period of
                            greater leisure. But an<lb/>untimely death, arresting him in the midst
                            of his<lb/>labours, has torn him from science and his country,<lb/>and
                            left the task to other hands. With the view of<lb/>reviving inquiry upon
                            this subject, we publish the<lb/>circular drawn up by <persName
                                key="jeddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, and solicit the atten-<lb/>tion of
                            the scientific to the topics therein suggested.<lb/>Any communications,
                            addressed to the editors, will<lb/>be gladly received, and immediately
                            placed in the<lb/>possession of one who will turn them to good
                            account.</p>

                                    affording a basis for a correct calcu-<lb/>lation of the future

                                    very<lb/><pb n="333" facs="SW_TE1834_330"/>curious particulars in its general

                                    in so remark-<lb/>able a degree, or to so great an extent, in

                                    relative<lb/>to these, and by comparing these facts with
                                    each<lb/>other, and judging by the rules of analogy
                                    drawn<lb/>from similar appearances in other parts of the

                                    the<lb/>singular features I have mentioned, has induced
                                    me<lb/>to take the liberty of addressing you, and to beg
                                    the<lb/>favour of you to answer the queries inclosed, as
                                    far<lb/>as your knowledge extends, and as much in detail
                                    as<lb/>you conveniently can. But before proceeding to
                                    the<lb/>queries, I will add some conjectures of my own,
                                    drawn<lb/>from the very limited means of information I at
                                    pre-<lb/>sent possess.</p>
                                <p>It is well known that there are, at the <placeName key="lfall"
                                        >Little Falls</placeName><lb/>of the <geogName key="mohaw"
                                        >Mohawk river</geogName>, evident marks of the
                                    rocks<lb/>having been formerly washed by the waves, or by
                                    a<lb/>current of water one hundred feet above the
                                    present<lb/>surface at the head of the falls. Now it appears,
                                    by<lb/>the levels taken by the surveyors employed by
                                    the<lb/>commissioners of the Grand Canal, that the
                                    surface<lb/>of the water at that place, is less than sixty
                                    feet<lb/>lower than at <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName>,
                                    therefore it seems to me there<lb/>can be no doubt, that when
                                    the waters washed the<lb/>top of the hill at the falls, the
                                    country above, along<lb/>the valley of the river, as far as (and
                                    much, farther<lb/>than) <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName>,
                                    must once have been the bottom of a<lb/>large lake, bounded on
                                    each side, at no great distance,<lb/>by the uplands, and
                                    presenting, in shape, a long nar-<lb/>row arm, similar to the
                                    present lakes of <geogName key="cayug">Cayuga</geogName> and<lb/>
                                    <geogName key="senec">Seneca</geogName>; and as there is a
                                    gradual descent in the<lb/>country west of <placeName key="rome"
                                        >Rome</placeName>, as far as <placeName key="three"
                                        >Three-River Point</placeName>,<lb/>and the elevation from
                                    that point to the falls of the<lb/><geogName key="sener">Seneca
                                        river</geogName> near <placeName key="scawy"
                                        >Scawyace</placeName>, is very inconsiderable,<lb/>it seems
                                    to me equally undoubted, that the waters<lb/>once reached so
                                    far, including the present <geogName key="cayug"
                                        >Cayuga</geogName>,<lb/><geogName key="cross"
                                        >Cross</geogName>, <geogName key="ononl"
                                    >Onondaga</geogName>, and <geogName key="oneil">Oneida
                                        lakes</geogName>, the last of which <lb/><pb n="334" facs="SW_TE1834_331"/>I
                                    imagine was near the centre. I suppose this great<lb/>lake to
                                    have been bounded on the east by the hill at<lb/>the falls; on
                                    the south by the uplands, giving rise to<lb/>the head waters of
                                    the <geogName key="susqu">Susquehannah</geogName>; on the
                                    north<lb/>by the elevation of the great step from the
                                    lower<lb/>falls on <geogName key="genes2">Gennesee</geogName> to
                                        <geogName key="oswef">Oswego Falls</geogName>; and on the
                                    east,<lb/>by the uplands between the head waters of <geogName
                                        key="mudcr">Mud<lb/>Creek</geogName> and <geogName
                                        key="genes2">Genesee River</geogName>. Its extent up the
                                    valley<lb/>of <geogName key="mudcr">Mud Creek</geogName> I don't
                                    pretend to conjecture, but sup-<lb/>pose its length from east to
                                    west may have been<lb/>about a hundred and twenty miles, and its
                                    breadth<lb/>in general about twenty. All the country
                                    within<lb/>these limits is a flat, surrounded by much
                                    higher<lb/>land, and its soil, and likewise its small and
                                    almost<lb/>imperceptible horizontal inclination is, I
                                    believe,<lb/>precisely similar to the muddy bottoms of the
                                    lakes<lb/>I have mentioned. But the circumstance which<lb/>seems
                                    to me most strongly to corroborate my opinion,<lb/>is the known
                                    decrease in the waters of these lakes,<lb/>and, of course,
                                    diminution in their extent, and the<lb/>time probably is
                                    approaching when they will be<lb/> entirely drained, and when
                                    the land left by the<lb/>water is covered with timber, (which
                                    would soon be<lb/>the case if left to nature,) it will present a
                                    country<lb/>similar in appearance to that on the south side
                                        of<lb/><geogName key="oneil">Oneida Lake</geogName>, the

                                    with creeks<lb/>meandering through it like the <geogName

                <p>The early education of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was, as the
                    fact<lb/>is given by himself, miscellaneous and scanty. The<lb/>most approved
                    schools in his youthful days were very<lb/>indifferent, compared with those of
                    modern times,<lb/>and but little more than the first elements of educa-<lb/>tion
                    could be had in them. He was in a good mea-<lb/>sure self-taught, and by
                    observing a right course, he<lb/>was constantly at school, while in the course
                    of his<lb/>business, and gained a knowledge of the world as he<lb/>proceeded in
                    the duties of life. Such knowledge, if<lb/>not at first entirely correct, has a
                    self correcting prin-<lb/>ciple in it, which is experience.</p>
                <p>His mind was so well disciplined, that every thing<lb/>he gained he kept; and in
                    gathering up his treasures<lb/>of knowledge, he always calculated on ulterior
                    views,<lb/>which were not then, even to his own mind, fully<lb/> developed. He
                    was ambitious of attainment, but<lb/>never suffered his vanity to interfere with
                    the means<lb/>of gaining knowledge, for he was at great pains in<lb/> getting
                    the opinion of the wise and good on every<lb/>subject; but he never followed the
                    opinions of any<lb/>man, until he had studied the subject thoroughly,<lb/><pb
                        n="338" facs="SW_TE1834_335"/>and weighed every opinion offered. He compared<lb/>all, and, as an
                    optimist, selected for himself. He<lb/>never seemed startled at any theory,
                    however singular,<lb/>but took the pains to examine it calmly, and if
                    bound<lb/>to refute it, did it mildly, but distinctly. In all his<lb/>exertions,
                    he always measured the means in regard to<lb/>the ends, and was seldom deceived
                    in his calculations;<lb/>yet, at times, he was considered as a bold
                    financier,<lb/>full of expedients; but the results always justified
                    his<lb/>calculations, and there can be no doubt, but that the<lb/>opinions which
                    he offered on various subjects to the<lb/>corporations to which he belonged,
                    which were not<lb/>adopted in the early part of his course, but which<lb/>
                    proved in the end to be the correct ones, gave him a<lb/>greater influence
                    afterwards, than if they had pre-<lb/>vailed at the time they were given.</p>
                <p>His mind was quick, shrewd, and logical. He<lb/>caught a suggestion with great
                    readiness, but was<lb/>slow in making up his judgment. He looked on
                    all<lb/>sides of a question with immense care, for he was<lb/>early taught
                    precaution, the first ingredient in good<lb/> sense. His combinations,
                    comparisons, parallels, in-<lb/>ferences, and arguments, were all familiar to
                    him<lb/>before his opinions were promulgated, but when his<lb/> judgments were
                    formed, they were not readily given<lb/>up, upon any authority. If, in coming to
                    a conclu-<lb/>sion, he was slow and wary, in action he was rapid<lb/>and
                    indefatigable.</p>
                <p>He never wrote until he had arranged his thoughts,<lb/>and chosen his language to
                    clothe them; of course,<lb/>there is a neatness and fine connexion in his
                    writ-<lb/>ing, which, if they do not exalt his style to classical<lb/>beauty,
                    make it a much better business vehicle.<lb/>There are no extraordinary thoughts,
                    no wonderfully<lb/>brilliant sentences, in his productions, that could
                    be<lb/>quoted to show his strength of wing or boldness of<lb/>flight, but in
                    every work of his there are exhibited<lb/>strong leatures, and as a whole, the
                    production is<lb/>always effective. A forcible thinker, with only a<lb/><pb
                        n="339" facs="SW_TE1834_336"/>fair vocabulary, makes a clear and impressive writer.<lb/><persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> uses good words in their proper places,
                    and<lb/>that always makes a good style for any subject-mat-<lb/>ter. His logic
                    has much of the Aristotelian clearness<lb/>about it; but being exercised upon
                    the practical affairs<lb/>of life, instead of ingenious theories, it is not
                    so<lb/>apparent.</p>
                <p> His time was all his own, for he had no days of<lb/>gloom or hypochondriacism to
                    weaken the energies<lb/>of his mind, through the pulses of his heart.
                    He<lb/>indulged in no morbid views of life, nor suffered<lb/>from over strained
                    feelings at human misery, but he<lb/>knew all the evils that existed, and had
                    nerve enough<lb/>to combat them. He depended for fame on no one<lb/>brilliant
                    deed, or no one fortunate occurrence, but on<lb/>a life of active benevolence. A
                    command over his<lb/>passions, is the first lesson that he who intends
                    to<lb/>live for mankind, should learn. It is in this cool sere-<lb/>nity that
                    the mind gains its greatest strength and<lb/>aptitude for action. When obtained,
                    it gives to youth<lb/>the habits and facilities that belong to riper
                    years.<lb/>This complacency increases every day by reflection,<lb/>and keeps the
                    mind from decrepitude and decay in<lb/>more advanced years. In such a state, a
                    man, like<lb/>the mariner sailing before the refreshing trade winds,<lb/>can
                    calculate almost to a certainty what may be accom-<lb/>plished in a given time.
                    When the imagination is<lb/>under proper control, and man is guided by
                    expe-<lb/>rience, he can correct yesterday's error, if one was<lb/>made, by
                    to-day's reasoning. In such a life, where<lb/>every thing is accurately measured
                    and surveyed, the<lb/>world passes onward, not like the uncertain
                    shadow<lb/>upon the dial of life, flitting with every cloud, but<lb/>like the
                    heavenly bodies,<lb/><quote>Wheeling unshaken through the void

                <p>The religious order to which <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was
                    attached<lb/>by birth and principle, have ever since their rise<lb/>been
                    remarkable for self-discipline. This character-<lb/>istic gave <persName

                            n="340" facs="SW_TE1834_337"/>over the Indians, which preserved peace for so many<lb/>years in
                    their borders. Such men suffer in turbu-<lb/>lent times for not taking part in

                    of<lb/>quiet. <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was a firm orthodox

                    differ-<lb/>ence of opinion, upon some of the leading doctrines,<lb/>was the
                    cause of this unhappy division. Although<lb/>this separation did not take place
                    in the <orgName key="nym">society at<lb/>New York</orgName>, until after
                        <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s death, yet as he,<lb/>from the
                    beginning, took such a deep interest in the<lb/>controversy, which was carried
                    on for many years<lb/>previous to this event, it becomes the duty of
                    his<lb/>biographer to allude to it.</p>
                <p>A late celebrated minister in the society, who, from<lb/>his strong natural
                    talents, purity of life, and patri-<lb/>archal appearance, had obtained
                    unbounded influence<lb/>over a large portion of the members, for many
                    years<lb/>previous to <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s death, was
                    very active and<lb/>zealous in propagating his peculiar sentiments upon<lb/>the
                    doctrines of the atonement and divinity of our<lb/>Saviour. Without meaning, in
                    the least, to call in<lb/>question his sincerity, or the purity of his
                    motives,<lb/>it must be admitted, that he held opinions on those<lb/>important
                    doctrines, and also respecting the holy<lb/>scriptures, which differed
                    materially from those held<lb/>by <persName key="rbarc1">Robert
                        Barclay</persName>, and the early Quakers. They<lb/>ever believed in the
                    divinity of the Saviour, and in<lb/>the efficacy of the outward atonement, in
                    conjunc-<lb/>tion with spiritual regeneration; whilst <emph rend="italic"
                        >he</emph> lowered<lb/>the character of the Redeemer, to that of a <emph
                        rend="italic">good man</emph>,<lb/>and holy pattern, and denied the efficacy
                    of the<lb/>atonement altogether, relying solely on the regene-<lb/>ration, as a
                    means of Salvation. The founders of<lb/>the society also, uniformly upheld the
                    authenticity<lb/>and inspiration of the scriptures, declaring them to<lb/><pb
                        n="341" facs="SW_TE1834_338"/>be the only outward standard for determining the<lb/>soundness of
                    their doctrines, and the truth of their<lb/>principles; whilst this modern
                    preacher frequently<lb/>called in question their divine authority. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>, and other influential members of
                    the<lb/>society, took an active part in endeavouring to arrest<lb/>the progress,
                    of what they considered heterodox opi-<lb/>nions, and they always openly
                    declared, that the<lb/>doctrines promulgated by the preacher before
                    men-<lb/>tioned, were contrary to the fundamental principles<lb/>of the society,
                    and that therefore they could have no<lb/> unity with him. <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was one of the warmest<lb/>advocates in
                    favour of orthodox opinions, and one of<lb/>the earliest to detect the
                    heterodoxy of the new prin-<lb/>ciples. Regardless of worldly consequences, he
                    had<lb/>the courage openly and honestly to avow his senti-<lb/>ments, and thus
                    became unpopular with those in the<lb/> society, who took the opposite side; but
                    this moved<lb/>him not—and he continued, through evil report and<lb/>good
                    report, to show his marked disapprobation of<lb/>those doctrines, until his
                    death.</p>
                <p>No cause was so dear to his heart, as the interests<lb/> of the society in which
                    he was born and educated,<lb/>and for which he always manifested the most
                    ardent<lb/>attachment; he, therefore, most deeply deplored the<lb/> division of
                    sentiment, upon what he considered vital<lb/>principles.</p>
                <p>The <orgName key="lym">yearly meeting of Friends</orgName> in England, which<lb/>may be aptly termed the <emph
                        rend="italic">parent society</emph>, has officially<lb/>pronounced its
                    condemnation of the novel doctrines<lb/>which were promulgated here, and refuses
                    to hold<lb/>any intercourse with the Society in this country,<lb/>which
                    sanctions those doctrines.</p>
                <p>So far, therefore, as human authority goes, <persName key="teddy1"
                        >Mr.<lb/>Eddy</persName>'s opinions have been completely sustained;<lb/>and
                    although he did not live to witness the division<lb/> in the Society which now
                    exists, yet he clearly fore-<lb/>saw, many years ago, that such must inevitably
                    be<lb/>the result of the controversy. </p>
                <pb n="342" facs="SW_TE1834_339"/>
                <p> The celebrated preacher alluded to, has since fol-<lb/>lowed <persName
                        key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> to the silent grave;—they are
                    both<lb/>removed beyond the sphere of human praise or cen-<lb/>sure, and we may
                    safely leave them in the hands of<lb/>Him who judgeth righteously, and who alone
                    knoweth<lb/>the secrets of all hearts.</p>
                <p>When the mind is serene, there is nothing of the<lb/>value of life lost in
                    pungent regret for hasty conduct<lb/>and irritable feelings, and nothing by the
                    intoxica-<lb/>ting influence of inordinate joy. To one prepared to<lb/>be happy
                    by religious philosophy and self-discipline,<lb/> bent on pursuing <quote>the
                        even tenor of his way,</quote> curi-<lb/>osity, desire of knowledge, and
                    love of fame, <quote>the<lb/>last infirmity of noble minds,</quote> are all
                    subservient to<lb/> happiness.</p>
                <p><persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> had fine powers of conversation.
                    He<lb/>was gently animated in speaking in public or pri-<lb/>vate, and seemed to
                    proceed with ease and fluency.<lb/>If his eloquence had nothing in it of the
                    force of the<lb/>rapid stream, or the sweep of the tide, still it was<lb/>more
                    difficult to resist; it was like the gentle drop-<lb/>pings whose continuance
                    will wear away the stone.<lb/>He had no equal in managing a matter before a
                    deli-<lb/>berative body. He watched the <q><emph rend="italic"><foreign
                                xml:lang="lat">mollia tempora<lb/>fandi</foreign></emph>,</q>
                    and said no more than just what was wanted<lb/>for the occasion. He was
                    unruffled when hardly<lb/> listened to, and sometimes rudely treated; but at
                    the<lb/>next interview, it was seen that he had made an im-<lb/>pression on him,
                    who had, perhaps, in a moment of<lb/> irritation, turned hastily away. Most
                    minds are to<lb/>be won, if the suitor only knows the means, and<lb/>notices the
                    proper seasons for his appliances.</p>
                <p>He was conscious that he was acting for the pub-<lb/>lic good, and was therefore
                    always self-possessed.</p>
                <p>As a neighbour, <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> was kind and
                    obliging,<lb/>and attentive to all the little courtesies of life, and<lb/>was
                    loved and respected by those near him, which<lb/>cannot always be said even of
                    those who are striving<lb/>to benefit mankind.</p>
                <pb n="343" facs="SW_TE1834_340"/>
                <p>In the domestic circle he was pleasant and instruc-<lb/>tive, and seemed desirous
                    of filling up every hour as<lb/>of some value to himself and to others. He
                    seemed<lb/>desirous of examining the mind and habits of the<lb/>young, in order
                    to assist them in gathering up pro-<lb/>per stores of knowledge, and of giving a
                    right direc-<lb/>tion to their affections. This communion with<lb/>young minds
                    is as beneficial to those in years, as to<lb/>the youth who listens to the
                    lessons of age. The<lb/>fresh and novel views of the world, coming all
                    unso-<lb/>phisticated from the young, awaken the recollections<lb/>of youth in
                    the mind of one near the grave, and he<lb/>seems to travel back again with
                    pleasure to the days<lb/>when every vision was bright, and hope had
                    not<lb/>known the companion of her later years—disappoint-<lb/>ment. The value
                    of existence will unquestionably<lb/>be increased, when we come to understand by
                    the<lb/>mental improvements which are going on, how much<lb/>good we may do, and
                    of how much happiness we<lb/>are susceptible.</p>
                <p>The person of <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName> bore no
                    extraordinary<lb/>marks to the casual observer. He was about five<lb/>feet six
                    inches in height, of a muscular, compact<lb/>frame, capable of bearing great
                    fatigue without in-<lb/>convenience, and he delighted in corporeal activity
                    as<lb/>well as mental exertion. His head was large and<lb/>well shaped, the
                    features of his face were strong and<lb/>prominent, and his whole physiognomy
                    bold and<lb/>striking. The elevation of his eyebrows gave the<lb/>whole
                    countenance an air of profound meditation.<lb/>He dressed with great uniformity
                    and neatness. If<lb/>his face bore deep traces of thought, there were
                    none<lb/>of grief. He commemorated the death of his friend<lb/>with pious and
                    affectionate propriety, but indulged<lb/>in no feverish lamentations at their
                    departure, bow-<lb/>ing in humble resignation to the will of heaven.<lb/>He had
                    been failing for several months, but at<lb/>last his death was as sudden as his
                    life was serene.<lb/>He died on the <date when="1827-09-16">16th of September,
                        1827</date>, in the sixty- <lb/><pb n="344" facs="SW_TE1834_341"/>ninth year of his age, of
                    paralysis. He, who had<lb/>done so much to alleviate the sufferings of
                    others,<lb/>was not doomed to suffer much himself. For him<lb/>death had no
                    sting and the grave no victory. The<lb/>sweet precepts and holy influence of
                    Christianity had<lb/>destroyed both.</p>
                <p>More than four years previous to <persName key="teddy1">Mr. Eddy</persName>'s
                    death,<lb/>he withdrew himself from the affairs of the <placeName key="newyh"

                            useful-<lb/>ness, and in promoting, by his efficient aid,

                        <p>DIED, yesterday morning, in the 70th year of his<lb/>age, <persName
                                key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName>, for many years a highly
                            respect-<lb/>able and useful citizen. He was an active member<lb/>of
                            most of our charitable institutions, in whose wel-<lb/>fare and
                            prosperity he was deeply interested, and in<lb/>whose service most of
                            the latter part of his life was<lb/>spent. As a governor of the
                                <placeName key="newyh">New York Hospital</placeName>, he<lb/>was
                            eminently useful, and by his firmness of character, <lb/><pb n="347" facs="SW_TE1834_344"/>and close application to the interest of the establish-<lb/>ment,
                            filled the highest offices therein, to the entire<lb/> approbation of
                            his constituents. He was a firm and<lb/>constant advocate of the
                            Lancasterian system of edu-<lb/>cation, and of the immense importance of
                            public cha-<lb/>rity schools, in whose welfare he felt a deep and
                            lively<lb/> interest. His services as a director of the <orgName

                            appreciated by his fellow<lb/>members, and by them his loss will be
                            deeply regret-<lb/>ted. To the descendants of Africa he was a
                            sincere<lb/>and valuable friend, deeply sympathizing with them<lb/>in
                            their low and degraded state, and endeavouring<lb/>by every means in his
                            power, to break the shackles<lb/>which bind them to the cruel yoke of
                            their oppressors.<lb/>He was an early advocate for internal
                            improvements;<lb/>and his name will be found among the first
                            commis-<lb/>sioners for the construction of the <geogName key="eriec"

                        <p>In short, he was a charitable, a philanthropic, and<lb/>a good citizen, a
                            kind father, and a tender husband.</p>
                        <p> His funeral will take place on Tuesday afternoon,<lb/>the <date

                        <p>An obituary notice of <persName key="teddy1">Thomas Eddy</persName> of

                                >New<lb/>York</placeName> papers. It bears a just testimony, which
                            we<lb/>were glad to repeat, and to which we would add an<lb/>humble
                            tribute on our own part, arising from per-<lb/>sonal acquaintance, and a
                            deep impression of the<lb/>excellence of his character. Unaffected,
                            inexhausti-<lb/>ble goodness; sound sense; extensive information<lb/>on
                            the practical interests and objects of society; anx-<lb/>ious,
                            indefatigable benevolence—were the leading<lb/><pb n="348" facs="SW_TE1834_345"/>traits which
                            gained for him an extraordinary share<lb/>of fond esteem and confidence,
                            wherever he was<lb/>known. He belonged to the religious
                            denomination<lb/>of Friends, and in the modest simplicity of his
                            tone<lb/>and habits, and the directness, equanimity, and toler-<lb/>ance
                            of his spirit, as well as by the absolute useful-<lb/>ness of his
                            pursuits and studies, he seemed to realize<lb/>the picture which
                                <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName> himself sketched,
                            as<lb/> that of a genuine disciple, and a true Christian, in<lb/>his
                            interpretation of Christianity.</p>
                        <p>There are few, we believe, of the splendid internal<lb/> improvements, of
                            the foundations of social charity,<lb/>or the plans for the amelioration
                            of public morals<lb/>and education, that have signalized, during the
                            pre-<lb/>sent century, the judgment, benevolence, and enter-<lb/>prise
                            of <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, with which the name of
                                <persName key="teddy1">Thomas<lb/>Eddy</persName> is not connected,
                            with more or less original<lb/>and acknowledged merit. He was among the
                            first<lb/>projectors and promoters of the <geogName key="eriec">Grand
                                Canal</geogName>; he<lb/>took a principal part in the establishment

                            and<lb/>houses of refuge; he entered into all their details<lb/>with
                            equal zeal and intelligence; he read, he wrote,<lb/>he travelled, almost
                            without intermission, for pur-<lb/>poses of common good or special
                            humanity:—he<lb/>united the bias and exertions of a <persName

                                >Bene-<lb/>zet</persName>, to those propensities and inquiries which
                            imme-<lb/>diately advance the trade, agriculture, and gene-<lb/>ral
                            comfort and beauty of a state. This is a rare<lb/>combination of tastes
                            and endeavours, and in him it<lb/>was not in the least ostentatious or
                            officious, but<lb/>wore a natural, easy, unobtrusive air, suitable to
                            his<lb/>whole mien and style, and never failed to prove effi-<lb/>cient,
                            when it had scope and encouragement. So<lb/>beneficent a being is now
                            enjoying a rest happier<lb/>than that of any of his race, who worshipped
                            at<lb/>shrines of false glory, and wearied their powers in<lb/>seeking
                            or achieving the triumphs of ambition, vanity,<lb/>or avarice. We have
                            seen men of stout hearts, but<lb/><pb n="349" facs="SW_TE1834_346"/>kindred dispositions,
                            moved to tears, in first contem-<lb/>plating <persName key="teddy1"

                            We never approached him without expe-<lb/>riencing a moral refreshment,
                            analogous to the phy-<lb/>sical sensation produced by a pure, elastic,
                            balmy<lb/> atmosphere. The same delightful influence is always<lb/>shed,
                            in a measure, by veteran, unequivocal, active<lb/>virtue; but the
                            artlessness and serenity attending the<lb/>source in this instance, the

                            and unso-<lb/>phisticated reason, caused it to be felt by more
                            minds<lb/>with superior force. It is merely justice to add, that<lb/>the

                            acted in <placeName key="nycit">New York</placeName>, appre-<lb/>ciated

                            emanation<lb/>of goodness which we have just noticed—all must<lb/>be
