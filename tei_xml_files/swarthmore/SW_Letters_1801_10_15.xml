                <p>This collection of miscellaneous correspondence is housed at Friends Historical
                    Library, on the campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010,
                    Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between
                    in Early American Literature”) transcribed these manuscripts as part of a larger
                    project to make the library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more
                    accessible. The project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends
                    Historical Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English.
                    Transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by Professor Murray.

            <editorialDecl>
                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>

                <p> This is to let you know I am much<lb/> rejoiced to see friend <persName
                        key="jclar1">Joseph Clark</persName>, come by the side of our<lb/> fire
                    place, and bring our Girls home. I can not but<lb/> bless the great good Spirit
                    for his great goodness in preserving<lb/> our long absented Girls from various
                    dangers and that<lb/> they have found favour in the sight of such good Friends,
                    as to<lb/> take them under their benevolent care and instruct them<lb/> in good
                    things and ways; I acknowledge that you have done<lb/> a great deal for us, out
                    of love to the Great good Spirit and<lb/> your fellow Creatures, that we poor
                    Natives might as it were<lb/> rise up &amp; walk, and follow the good path which
                    you follow, by which<lb/> I always feel thankful &amp; hope you will not lose
                    your reward<lb/> in Heaven, I feel our obligations are increased as our
                    advanta<lb/>-ges are increased to serve God in sincerity and in truth.</p>
                    <p>The
                    Religion is somewhat low amongst us, but Christians<lb/> seem to keep on still,
                    there has been but a few careless ones<lb/> stir'd up for soul Concern, since
                        your young Men left us, who<lb/> were <pb n="2" facs="SW_Letters_1801_10_15_Page_02"/> at <placeName key="oneid"
                        >Oneida</placeName>, but others seem still to remain in the bon<lb/>dage of
                    Spiritual Pharaoh, but God is able to turn their hearts<lb/> and make them
                    willing to walk towards Canaan.</p><p> I have no time to express as I feel, but to
                    conclude with your<lb/> prayers that the Great good Spirit may pour down his
                    bless<lb/>ings upon Us, that religion may again revive among us.</p>
