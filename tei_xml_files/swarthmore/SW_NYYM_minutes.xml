                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
                <p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                        <p>Brothers!<lb/> Your letter of 8th month last was reciev'd<lb/> and read
                            amongst us. We rejoice to hear of your welfare <lb/> and of the
                            resolution you have made to refrain from strong <lb/> drinks, it is a
                            good beginning towards your improvement and <lb/> we have no doubt as
                            you keep to it, you will be able to <lb/> cultivate your lands better,
                            and by industry soon live more</p>

                        <p>more comfortably on the fruits thereof-<lb/> Brothers! that you may be
                            able to keep these good<lb/> resolutions, we wish you to attend very
                            carefully to what the <lb/> good Spirit teaches in the heart, for it is
                            placed there as <lb/> a guide to show what to do and what to leave
                            undone and<lb/> to lead you and us to virtue and happiness agreeable
                            <lb/> to what you will find written in that good book which<lb/> your
                            Brother sent you from over the great water. And altho'<lb/> you may not
                            now comprehend some of the mysteries con<lb/> tained in that excellent
                            book, yet, as you become more <lb/> and more disposed to listen to the
                            voice of the gret and <lb/> good Spirit in your hearts, your minds will
                            gradually<lb/> be enlighten'd to understand the things written
                            therein,<lb/> so far as is necessary for you-</p>

                            Report! That during the course of the <lb/> last <del>season</del> Year
                            the subject hath from time to time claimed our close<lb/> attention, and
                            our minds have felt much engaged for the prom<lb/>otion of their civil
                            and religious welfare: two Men and two Women<lb/> of our number have
                            made them a visit, and spent some time<lb/> amongst the different Tribes
                            and by their report we find, that<lb/> notwithstanding they have made
                            considerable advances in Agricu<lb/>lture and civilization in general
                            yet owing to divers of their <lb/> Chiefs and others given way to the
                            pernicious practice of drinking<lb/> to excess, their progress in these
                            respects is much retarded, and this<lb/> weakness we fear has with some
                            of them rather increased, yet<lb/> it appears that many of the <orgName
                                key="oneida">Oneida</orgName> have wholly refrained<lb/> from the

                            in civilization than the other Tribes yet <lb/> they seem animated to
                            labour after further improvement<lb/> both civil and religious- The

                            <placeName key="broth">Brothertown</placeName> our minds were affected

                            effects in<lb/> retarding their civil and religious improvement; yet

                        <p>At <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName> the same evil of

                            consequently the pro<lb/>gress of civilization is slow. There are

                            are careful to<lb/> avoid this pernicious practice, for whom we felt

                            and<lb/> we have been united in the sentiment that the greatest<lb/>

                            the instruction to be given the rising genera<lb/>tion. To the

                            visit was not<lb/> satisfactory for want of a suitable Interpreter, yet

                            expected to make any other provision for the supp<lb/>ort of a Teacher

                            continued their resolution of abstai<lb/>ining from Spiritous liquors;
                            and the Epistle addressed<lb/> to them by the Committee was received wih

                    this important subject<lb/> have been led to apprehend that in order to be
                    more<lb/> extensively useful to that people the attention of Friends<lb/> should
                    be particularly turned to the Young &amp; rising<lb/> Generation who are in

                            equal to our solicitude<lb/> for their welfare, yet we continue
                            impressed with a sense of<lb/> the ratitude of the cause, and<lb/> of
                            our duty to move in it as<lb/> way may open in the clearness. Since our

                            to intemperance, hence they neglected<lb/> the cultivation of their

                            &amp; residing in the south part<lb/> of the settlement were
                            particularly noticed by the Committee<lb/> they being generally
                            considered as sober persons, mostly<lb/> abstaining from the use of
                            strong drink : they appeared<lb/> very desirous of our furnishing them
                            with a School Master<lb/> and we gave them some encouragement that we
                            would look<lb/> out for one, and bear a reasonable proportion of
                            the<lb/> expence with which they appeared satisfied; we have<lb/>
                            attended thereto but have not yet succeeded in procuring<lb/> a friend
                            for that purpose, and are thence induced to<lb/> offer the subject to
                            the consideration of Friends at large,<lb/> with a view that it may lead
                            to the attainment of this<lb/> desirable object: This Tribe had been
                            solicited to accept<lb/> of a School master from some other Society,
                            but<lb/> refused, assigning as a reason that they preferred<lb/> a

                            children &amp; to procuring proper places<lb/> for them, where they may

                                >Brothertown</placeName> &amp; called to see a number of<lb/> them
                            in their huts &amp; houses, some of which were very<lb/> comfortable
                            &amp; showed the effects of industry &amp; sobriety;<lb/> others &amp;
                            by much the largest proportion are still<lb/> habituated to intemperance
                            &amp; neglect the improvement<lb/> of their land;<lb/> there are in this
                            settlement<lb/> twelve framed houses &amp; ten barns &amp; the
                            number<lb/> of inhabitants about three hundred, including men,<lb/>
                            women &amp; children Being several days at<lb/>
                            <persName key="jdean1">John Dean's</persName>, we had an opportunity of
                            discovering<lb/> their situation &amp; qualifications for usefulness
                            among<lb/> this people, which produced a conviction on our<lb/> minds
                            that they are an acquisition to them &amp; the<lb/> Indians appear very
                            generally to consider them in<lb/> the most favorable point of view. It
                            is with<lb/> much satisfaction that we have it in our power to<lb/>
                            state that the Superintendants place the fullest<pb n="47" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_047"/>

                            disposed to encourage the School in a way quite satisfactory<lb/> as
                            also to grant to <persName key="jdean1">John Dean</persName> the use of
                            as much<lb/> cleared ground as he inclines to have, so that the<lb/>

                            the Superintendants; such other matters<lb/> were attended to as we hope

                                >Brothertown</placeName> more comfortable</p>

                            attended the council held<lb/> next morning, in which we encouraged them
                            to<lb/> sobriety &amp; industry, particularly the improvement of<lb/>
                            their lands; we learn that this South Party who go<lb/> under the

                            account<lb/> of the use of Spirituous Liquors &amp; some of them
                            labour<lb/> on the ground &amp; raise <del>corn</del> grain &amp; others
                            of them have<lb/> more or less stock; but generally speaking as far
                            as<lb/> we could discover they are still very improvident; <pb n="48" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_048"/><lb/>their saw mill being damaged, they solcited some aid <lb/>from us
                            to enable them to repair it; we told them <lb/>friends were inclined to
                            assist their Indian Brethren <lb/>when they found they were disposed to
                            labor and <lb/>assist themselves, that if they would turn out strong
                            <lb/>we might be will to lend them some assistance <lb/>they could repay
                            us out of their annuity.</p>
                        <p>As far as we could discern the Indians seem <lb/>to be well satisfied
                            with our friends <persName key="ahatf1">Absalom</persName> &amp;
                                <lb/><persName key="rhatf1">Ruth</persName>; they have left the

                            situated near the Council <lb/>Chamber &amp; now are in possesio of the

                            <lb/>of the articles furnished Absalom for his own &amp; <lb/>and the
                            use of the Indians, which also includes the <lb/>85 25/100 pd to get
                            possession of the house; <lb/>the whole amount being 449 55/100
                            Dollars.</p>
                        <p>As it is uncertain what accomodation the <lb/>Indians will provide for a
                            Teacher &amp; Absalom <pb n="49" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_049"/><lb/>&amp; Ruth are disposed to let
                            him have a part of <lb/>their house provided friends are willing to have
                            <lb/>some improvements made, which on consideration <lb/>we hope will
                            leave us justified in authorizing <lb/>Absalom to have done; the two
                            families residing <lb/>together may be better on several accounts, for
                            the <lb/>present at least. It appearing to us expedient <lb/>that
                            Absalom should be furnished with a waggon <lb/>&amp; another horse, we
                            encouraged hime to procure them.</p>
                        <p>At Oneida we met with two <orgName key="onondaga">Onondgoes</orgName>
                            <lb/>one of whom had been in New York in company <lb/>with several more
                            of the same nation &amp; had had <lb/>an interview with divers friends
                            there; they <lb/>appeared very solicitous that we should make their
                            <lb/>nation a visit &amp; on consideration we concluded to <lb/>proceed
                            accordingly. On reaching this settlement <lb/>which is about 33 miles
                            fomr Oneida, we had an <lb/>opportunity with them, all of us siting on
                            the <lb/>grass, which was tought more convenient than <lb/>meeting in
                            the house. The Interpreter is a white <lb/>
                            <lb/>man who has resided in the neighbourhood of the <pb n="50" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_050"/><lb/>Indians for many years &amp; at present lives in<lb/> their
                            settlement, he having liberty to cultivate<lb/> land for himself &amp;
                            his family; the Natives appear<lb/> better cloathed than the <orgName
                                key="oneida">Oneidas,</orgName> they received us<lb/> very
                            courteously &amp; we had a satisfactory time<lb/> with them which was
                            greatly increased when we<lb/> were informed not only by themselves but
                            the<lb/> Interpreter, that they had totally refrained<lb/> from the use
                            of ardent spirits for abt. nine<lb/> years &amp; that none of the
                            natives will touch<lb/> it; they spoke of the <del>Divers</del> Great
                            Spirit &amp; of<lb/> its divers influence with as much perspicuity<lb/>
                            as perhaps could be conveyed in any language<lb/> their number consists
                            of One hundred &amp; sixty, men, women<lb/> &amp; children; they possess
                            about twelve thousand acres of<lb/> land &amp; after they were
                            recommended to labor more<lb/> on the ground, they signified they were
                            willing so to<lb/> do, but never having been much taught &amp; not
                            having<lb/> the necessary implements to work with, they have<lb/> not
                            been able to make any great advance therein;<lb/> they informed us that
                            they had received some<pb n="51" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_051"/>
                            <lb/>encouragement from friends of <placeName key="phila"
                                >Philadelphia</placeName> of being <lb/> furnished with the means of
                            cultivating their lands, &amp; <lb/>when they found the <orgName
                                key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> were assisted they expected<lb/> we
                            would extend our kindness towards them</p>
                        <p>What is worthy of remark as relates to the <orgName key="onondaga"
                                >Onondagas</orgName><lb/> is, that they were formerly as noted for
                            their savage<lb/> manners &amp; great intemperance as they are now
                            for<lb/> their gentleness &amp; sobriety of conduct; the
                            Interpreter<lb/> informed us, they had been universally, men &amp;
                            women<lb/> given up to the excessive use of strong drink, so that<lb/>
                            all prospect of civilizing them appeared to be impractica<lb/>ble: this
                            great change affords rational grounds<lb/> for encouragement, that the
                            endeavors of friends to<lb/> promote the welfare of this people may be
                            attended<lb/> with success</p>

                        <p>At <placeName key="broth">Brothertown</placeName> we had an opportunity

                            considerable has been done<lb/> for them to little effect, we apprehend
                            it might be<lb/> best for Friends to withold all pecuniary aid from<lb/>
                            them for a season, as they have the mean of<lb/> living quite

                            <lb/>expected, considering the attention that has been paid them;<lb/>
                            many of them continue in the habit of drinking to excess,
                            whereby<lb/>the necessary attention to the improvement of their land
                            is<lb/> neglected</p>
                        <p>The <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> nation we think have
                            made considerable<lb/> advancement in improving their lands and raising

                            encouraged <lb/>thereto by their young women's learning to spin in
                            consequence<lb/> of being furnished by the Committee with wheels, flax,
                            wool<lb/> &amp; On their receiving these a general Council was
                            called<lb/> to consult on the method to be pursued in teaching
                            their<lb/> girls the use of them, and they unitedly agreed that a<lb/>
                            school should be established for the purpose, and that<lb/> one of the
                            Young Women educated in <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>

                            &amp; harmony. On our going into the School<lb/> room, we found 38
                            bunches of yarn hanging in regular<lb/> order, under the names of 38

                            seem encouraged to turn<lb/> their attention to raise sheep as well as
                            flax for the<lb/> purpose. But too many here as well as at <placeName

                        <p>It appears that individual members<lb/> of the Society had occasionally

                                    first visited those settled at <placeName key="broth"
                                        >Brothertown</placeName>, which<lb/> is about one hundred

                                    possess about 10,000 acres of<lb/> very fair land, given them by

                                    square of excellent<lb/> land; they removed from <placeName

                                    retain<lb/> their native dress and manners; some of them
                                    have<lb/> separate farms, but they are very indifferently
                                    tilled, as<pb n="118" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_118"/>
                                    <lb/>many of them are idle and indisposed to the cultivation
                                    of<lb/> their land, which must in great measure be attributed
                                    to<lb/> their former habits of life in hunting &amp;c. This<lb/>
                                    nation consists of about 60 families; they were
                                    <del>about</del><lb/> endeavouring to get a saw mill erected,
                                    but not having<lb/> funds to complete it, we furnished them with
                                    pecuniary<lb/> aid. We had much satisfaction in a Council
                                    with<lb/> the men and women of this tribe, one of them on
                                    behalf<lb/> the rest expressed their sorrow that the great evil
                                    of drinking<lb/> Spirituous Liquors had so much prevailed
                                    amongst his<lb/> nation and Western Brothers, which had blinded
                                    many, <lb/>and prevented their following the advice of the
                                    Friends<lb/> as they had been used to do; for which he was very
                                    sorry, as<lb/> the <orgName key="sxntns">Six Nations</orgName>
                                    had long experienced the kindness of<lb/>

                                <p>From <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName> we went to

                                        >Oneidas</orgName>; this nation resided where<lb/> they now
                                    are when the Country was first known to the<lb/> white people;
                                    it now consists of about 150 families, and<lb/> altho' they
                                    possess 24 miles square of excellent land,<lb/> they have made
                                    but little agricultural improvement<lb/> or advancement in
                                    civilized life, being like the<lb/> other Tribes addicted to the
                                    excessive use of ardent spirits;<lb/> they are mostly very idle,
                                    and the little labour which<lb/> is done is commonly performed
                                    by the women.<pb n="119" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_119"/></p>
                                <p>We had a prospect of preceeding from the place to<lb/> visit the
                                        <orgName key="onondaga">Onondagoes</orgName>, a Tribe
                                    resident about 35 miles<lb/> further west; this prospect however
                                    we relinquished on<lb/> learning that they were the most
                                    uncivilized of any of<lb/> the <orgName key="sxntns">Six
                                        Nations</orgName>, and lived in habitual intoxication;<lb/>
                                    and that they were generally at that time in a state<lb/> of
                                    drunkenness, having recently received their annuity from<lb/>
                                    the Government, which had induced white Traders to<lb/> carry
                                    Spirituous Liquors amongst them; but as there<lb/> were a few
                                    sober sensible men in the Tribe, we sent<lb/> an address to
                                        <persName key="cjohn1">Capt John</persName>, one of their

                                    our solicitude<lb/> for their welfare.</p>
                                <p>We had often to lament the strong<lb/> attachment of the Indians
                                    to Spirituous Liquors<lb/> which is the principal obstacle to
                                    their civilization<lb/> and agricultural improvement, and we
                                    consider it<lb/> of the utmost importance to prevent by every
                                    possible<lb/> means the introduction of this article amongst
                                    them.<lb/> And it is our decided opinion that it would tend<lb/>
                                    greatly to their advantage could they be prevailed<lb/> on to
                                    have farms allotted to each family, in order<lb/> that they may
                                    have some idea of separate property,<lb/> which would be likely
                                    to produce habits of industry,<lb/> and induce them more
                                    generally to till the ground for<lb/> their support.</p>

                                    impress on the minds of the<lb/> Indians such a knowledge of the
                                    Supreme Being and of the<lb/> teachings of his Grace as they
                                    appeared to be capable of<lb/> receiving to dissuade them from

                                    in the cultivation of their<lb/> lands; to give them a knowledge

                                    afterwards formed themselves into two parties and made a

                                    there<lb/> appeared to be the greatest probability of our being
                                    useful<lb/> to the latter, from their being particularly<lb/>
                                    desirous of our<lb/> assistance, a family of Friends was placed
                                    there whose<lb/> counsel and attention have been very useful to

                                    their<lb/> land, and their improvements in husbandry, and

                                    having for<lb/> some years past relinquished the use of ardent
                                    spirits,<pb n="123" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_123"/>
                                    <lb/>and become sober and industrious, requested the
                                    assistance<lb/> of Friends; they have accordingly been supplied
                                    with<lb/> Oxen and farming utensils, and their agricultural<lb/>
                                    improvement and advancement in civilization have been<lb/> the
                                    most rapid of any of the Tribes.</p>
                                <p>Experience has proved that it is most bene<lb/>ficial to the
                                    Indians to be furnished with pecuniary aid<lb/> in such manner
                                    as may tend to develop and call into<lb/> exercise their own
                                    resources, lest they indulge the disposition<lb/> of depending
                                    upon Friends for regular and stated assistance,<lb/> which would
                                    eventually prove injurious to them; it has<lb/> therefore been
                                    deemed most advisable that the application<lb/> of our funds
                                    should be made productive of their agri<lb/>cultural improvement
                                    by procuring them the necessary<lb/> means to facilitate labour.
                                    And it is but justice<lb/> to observe that the liberality of our
                                    Brethren in<lb/>
                                    <placeName key="engl">England</placeName> has been sensibly
                                    felt, as thereby the Com<lb/>mittee has been enabled to extend
                                    its views and<lb/> enlarge the sphere of its usefulness to this

                            <lb/>improvement in agriculture, many of the men being<lb/> given to
                            intemperance &amp; indolence, which evil we<lb/> believe has been
                            greatly increased by the introduction<lb/> of white people living among
                            them: they have also been<lb/> induced to let out their Farms to these
                            people on<lb/> conditions unprofitable to themselves, thereby
                            depending<lb/> on their labor; but as arrangements are made by<lb/>
                            Government for removing the white inhabitants, we<lb/> encouraged them
                            to improve the land by their own<lb/> labor, and had the satisfaction to
                            Observe that<lb/> a number manifested a disposition to adhere thereto </p>
                        <p>The introduction of a spinning School amongst them<lb/> appears to have
                            stimulated a number of their women<lb/> to progress in that art; some of
                            them having<lb/> proceeded to make cloth for their own use; and<lb/> we
                            thought it right to furnish them with more<lb/> wool, flax and some
                            wheels, that the school may<lb/> be continued to advantage Some of the
                            men have<lb/> been induced to commence raising flax; that the<lb/>
                            continuance of this business affords a prospect of<lb/> usefuness to
                            that people, and we believe if persevered<pb n="137" facs="NYYM_minutes_Page_137"/>
                            <lb/>in, will gradually promote habits of industry<lb/> more generally

                        <p>The <placeName key="oneidss">South settlement</placeName> of the <orgName

                            improving in the arts<lb/> of agriculture, tho' here as in other Tribes
                            there<lb/> remains much room for advancement; some<lb/> of them we are
                            informed have refrained from the<lb/> use of ardent Spirits for a number
                            of years, others<lb/> have remained more or less intemperate; but<lb/>
                            owing to the coincidence of several affecting<lb/> circumstances, they
                            had lately convened in Council<lb/> and as we were informed, unitedly
                            agreed to<lb/> refrain enirely in future from the use of<lb/> Ardent
                            Spirits; we pressingly enjoined them<lb/> to maintain this resolution,
                            which they solemnly<lb/> promised faithfully observe. We encouraged<lb/>
                            their women to continue the arts of spinning,<lb/> knitting &amp; and
                            they uniting therewith, we<lb/> thought some further aid in furnishing

                            <lb/>one of their own Tribe appears willing to take<lb/> charge of a
                            School for instructing others in these<lb/> arts; and we directed some
                            materials to be<lb/> procured accordingly The oxen &amp; farming<lb/>
                            utensils heretofore furnished to this Tribe appear<lb/> to have been
                            useful, and for which they expressed<lb/> their gratitude: on enquiry we
                            understood they were<lb/> still in good repair, and likely to last the
                            present<lb/> season; but finding that they stood in need of a<lb/> few

                            stated to accommodate them<lb/> in building their houses and barns,

                            from evil practices<lb/> and to persevere in well doin; we were

                            the farming utensils<lb/> heretofore furnished were much worn, we
                            concluded<lb/> to procure two ploughs, chains and several kinds<lb/> of
                            tools for their use; they are desirous that one<lb/> or more of their

                        <p>At <placeName key="newst">New Stockbridge</placeName> in consequence of
                            the<lb/> residence of white people among them they have<lb/> been led to

                            <lb/>have progressed in that art, and they have proceed<lb/>ed to make

                            introduced some of the men<lb/> to commence raising flax: we think that
                            the<lb/> continuance of this business affords a prospect<lb/> of
                            usefulness to that people; and we believe if<lb/> persevered in will
                            gradually promote habits<lb/> of industry more generally amongst

                        <p>Agreeably to our appointment six of our<lb/> number have visited the
                            different Tribes of the<lb/> Natives which have been under the care of
                            the<lb/> Committee, had meetings of conference with them<lb/> at each

                            remarks made to them<lb/> appeared to be recieved with much
                            cordiality</p>
                        <p>We found amongst the men at <placeName key="broth"
                                >Brothertown</placeName><lb/> some who are improving their land, and
                            provide<lb/> comfortably for their families, which may also<lb/> be said

                            to find that the Women at <placeName key="stock"

                            <lb/>in the art of spinning, and appeared to be much<lb/> interested in
                            it. We understood that about sixty<lb/> of the women at <placeName
                                key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName> have learned to spin<lb/> and
                            about thirty at <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>. We were told
                            that<lb/> two of their number at <placeName key="stock"
                                >Stockbridge</placeName> who had learned<lb/> to spin in the School
                            of <persName key="mdoxs2">Mary Doxtader</persName> have<lb/> made during
                            the last year each sixty yards of<lb/> linen cloth, and a number of them
                            have made<lb/> cloth for fulling; and in order to encourage them<lb/>
                            still further, the Committee have thought proper to<lb/>grant to each
                            spinner at <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> two pounds of
