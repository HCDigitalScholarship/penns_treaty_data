                <p>This Rachel Coope manuscript is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the
                    campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students
                    enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed this manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Student
                    transcribers included: Miriam Lise Hauser. Transcriptions were compiled and
                    edited in the present form by Professor Murray. </p>

            <editorialDecl>
                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
                <p>This volume is actually a compilation by Rachel Coope's father, Joshua Sharpless,
                    taken after her death from her original journal and correspondence. Journals "a"
                    and "b," also in the collections of Friends Historical Library, represent
                    transcriptions of Rachel Coope’s actual diaries. Journal "a" her “esteemed
                    parents”; however, her mother died before the letter was written, and so it may
                    have been meant for her parents­in­law, to whom she was deeply attached) copied
                    over twice. No version of this letter is included in journal four. Except for
                    this, the differences were small, such as variance in phrasing and spelling, and
                    not in content. It seems as though journal "a" preceded journal "b"; it is less
                    polished. The handwriting seems more rushed and the paper size varies, while in
                    journal "b", the handwriting is neater, and the paper used is consistent. It is
                    possible that these, especially journal three, could have been handwritten by
                    Coope.</p>
                <p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                    notes that she preserv’d, from<lb/> her letters and from personal
                    knowledge.</head>

                <p> She was the daughter of <persName key="jshar1">Joshua</persName> and<lb/>
                    <persName key="eshar1">Edith Sharpless</persName> and was born the 3rd of
                    the<lb/> 5 mo 1771. About the 15th year of her age<lb/> her mother was taken
                    from her by death,<lb/> and the charge of her father’s family as<lb/>
                    housekeeper, very much devolv’d upon<lb/> her; the trial in both respects she
                    very<lb/> sensibly felt, yet was enabled to con-<lb/> duct her charge with
                    stability and pru-<lb/> dence, and bear the loss of her dear mo<lb/> ther, with
                    a becoming fortitude. For<lb/> several years the charge of the family<lb/>
                    rested upon her to which she attended<lb/> like one of riper age. She was
                    cheerful in<lb/> her disposition, and of a lively active turn<lb/> of mind,
                    which being seasoned with the<lb/> baptizing power of Truth, rendered her<lb/>
                    company agreeable and instructive.</p>

                        Buckwheat- and some potatoes and corn<lb/> planted- all grew amazingly-- It
                        has<lb/> been a busy summer with us both men<lb/> and women; the forepart of
                        it we had at<lb/> work a carpenter and mill right and a<lb/> number of
                        Indians diging at the race.<lb/> It is very heavy work to clear land here,

                        produces-- About 13 <unclear>acres</unclear><lb/> is put in with wheat. --

                        fod-<lb/> der. the oats likewise was mow'd for foddering.-<lb/> It has not
                        been in our power to render the<lb/> natives much assistance this summer;
                        yet<lb/> I have no doubt our being here, has been<lb/> useful.- We have spun
                        some stocking wool<lb/> for our own use: to se the wool converted in-<lb/>
                        to stocking has excited their astonishment.<lb/> We have three little wheels
                        ready to run when<lb/> we get flax.-- We purpose this winter puting<lb/> up
                        a house near us for those Indians who<lb/> wish to learn, to spin &amp;c
                        in.- They appear<lb/> desirous to get more comfortable houses to<lb/> live
                        in- and for that purpose have bought<lb/> many 100 ft. of boards.- When the
                        young<lb/> men first came here, the cattle were all the<lb/> Indians had on
                        their river.- They will<lb/> now amount to several 100, a number of<lb/>
                        which are fine oxen which they have <unclear>broke</unclear>.<lb/> I have
                        endeavored to discribe the man-<lb/> ner of our geting along, and what we
                        have<lb/> done. I will intimate a little to thee now <lb/>
                        <pb n="17" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_17"/> how I have fared.- Thou knew it
                        was<lb/> a close tryal to me, to give up to be thus<lb/> separated from you;
                        and I have often been<lb/> made thankful that I <hi rend="underline"
                            >was</hi> favoured to<lb/> get into a state of resignation. I think<lb/>
                        I never enjoy'd a more comfortable state of<lb/> mind, than since residing
                        here.-- One first<lb/> day eve afternoon when they were long I feeling
                        the<lb/> want of society to introduce a new train<lb/> of ideas for the mind
                        to dwell on - a little<lb/> before the sun withdrew from us his rays.<lb/> I
                        walked out alone, seeking for some new<lb/> objects to amuse me and persued
                        the new<lb/> road about ¾ of a mile to the river. as I<lb/> walk'd along my
                        mind unintentionally<lb/> was engaged, in ruminating on my native<lb/> home,
                        my dear relations and friends, and<lb/> why I should be thus seperated
                        from<lb/> them.-- I was satisfy'd that it did not<lb/> proceed from any will
                        of my own but<lb/> much in the cross, and in submission<lb/> to inward
                        impressions.- As I was thus <lb/>
                        <pb n="18" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_18"/> musing my heart was fill'd with a
                        preci-<lb/> ous illumination, and self so reduced, that<lb/> I felt willing

                        events<lb/> but alass, this produced awful sensations;<lb/> and I was ready
                        to shudder at the prospect;<lb/> when unexpectedly and unsought for a<lb/>
                        language reviv'd, “Fear thou not neither be<lb/> dismay'd. I will strengthen
                        thee, yea I will<lb/> help thee, my grace is sufficient for thee.”<lb/> O
                        the Divine consolation that fill’d my<lb/> breast.- Tho’ as to the outward
                        it might<lb/> look lonesome; being in the wilderness-<lb/> far from society-
                        some distance from the<lb/> house and nearly dark: yet had I been<lb/> in
                        the midst of my friends no outward<lb/> enjoyment could have been equal to
                        the<lb/> precious sweetness I then experienced--<lb/> my heart overflow'd
                        with gratitude-- any<lb/> subtle petitions asconded for the continu-<lb/>

                        further refinement, and Oh that their may<lb/> be a willingness to be

                        bless'd, so that on<lb/> his returning, he said, "I am not worthy of

                        still the<lb/> same that ever it was, to those who<lb/> are truly devoted to
                        serve the Most<lb/> High. - my faith was a little<lb/> strengthened, the
                        mountains gradually<lb/> disappear'd and a belief increas'd, that<lb/> if it
                        was the Lords will for us to go, <lb/>
                        <pb n="22" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_22"/> he would support us if our eye
                        were<lb/> fixed upon him. -- Thus as I endea-<lb/> voured to become
                        resigned. I felt at sea-<lb/> sons a comfortable consolation, and have<lb/>
                        experienced, even in this remote part of<lb/> the country, a brook by the
                        way, that<lb/> will refresh the weary traveler.-- Our re-<lb/> ligious
                        opportunities are mostly attended<lb/> with a lively savour. It is
                        encouraging<lb/> to hear that the petitions of those who<lb/> have been <add
                            place="above">&amp; still are</add> as valiants in our Israel are<lb/>
                        ascending on our behalf.- Surely it calls<lb/> for grateful returns of
                        thankfulness to<lb/> the Author of all good.-</q></p>
                <p>
                    <q>The natives appear friendly disposed<lb/> and are gradually increasing in the
                        ideas<lb/> of civilized life.-- Some of them are much<lb/> spirited in
                        cultivating their farms and<lb/> in geting more comfortable
                    houses.--</q></p>
                <p>
                    <q>The concern feels weighty and impor-<lb/> tant, and I have no doubt but that
                        it<lb/> was rightly founded; and if those engag'd <lb/>

                <p> In answer to her brother <persName key="jshar2">JS</persName> who<lb/> desired
                    to be informed of the customs &amp; man-<lb/> -ners of the natives-- says
                        <q>Since the young<lb/> men resided here, the natives had a great<lb/> image
                        cut out of a Pine tree and made<lb/> after the figure of a man, and
                        painted,<lb/> so as to look frightful, which they call'd<lb/> the Great
                        Spirit. They had set times of<lb/> worshiping and dancing before it.
                        But<lb/> as their minds became more enlighten'd<lb/> some of them grew
                        uneasy with<lb/> this image, and they had many confer-<lb/> ences what
                        should be done with it; but<lb/> they were fearful of destroying it,
                        lest<lb/> some evil should befall them.- At<lb/> length one of their chiefs
                        proposed taking<lb/> it into the woods and puting some beans<lb/> and corn
                        by it, to shew their good will <lb/>
                        <pb n="24" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_24"/> for it. Hence after much debate

                        why this image you worship was once<lb/> a little sprout that grew out of
                        the ground<lb/> it could neither hear nor speak - well it was<lb/> made like
                        a man and we worship it still<lb/> it can neither hear nor speak- is this

                            <hi rend="underline">me</hi> leave and I will make way<lb/> with it.- At

                        <add>it</add> floated away -- but they watched him<lb/> thinking some evil
                        would happen him<lb/> for so doing -- Notwithstanding their image<lb/> is
                        gone they still continue regularly twice<lb/> a year their dances, offering

                        seldom or never wash their clothes or even<lb/> their hands or face- To

                        to us the first necessary and important<lb/> step- accordingly in the fall
                        we proposed<lb/> to them, to save their ashes and fat, and when<lb/> our
                        house was ready we would teach them<lb/> to make soap – for when they bring

                        whiles they nit and spin a little.<lb/> they bring provisions and cook for

                        with a piece of unleavened corn bread<lb/> and an old knife, and invited me

                        my mind was humbled<lb/> under the Heavenly canopy, and for a few<lb/> days

                    he was sent for.<lb/> The Doctors on confering together, believ'd<lb/> it not in
                    their power to give her relief.<lb/> After they had come to this conclusion<lb/>
                    I took my seat by her bedside. she<lb/> look'd a few minutes at me then,<lb/>
                    with her natural voice and much sim-<lb/> plicity asked me what the doctors
                    thought<lb/> of her. I told her, her situation was<lb/> so difficult they
                    apprehended they could<lb/> administer no relief. she reply'd<lb/> why do they

                <p> She delivered herself with much ease and<lb/> freedom, not appearing to be

                        done the best thou couldst.<lb/></q> he then asked her if she felt

                    <q>but it is a trial to me to leave my<lb/> dear husband so far from his

                    reliev'd<lb/> the forepart of this (which was the third<lb/> of her sickness)
                    she was cheerful tho’ very<lb/> sweet giving her sister directions about<lb/>
                    some things, also saying to her sister<lb/>
                    <q>it is my request that you will ever<lb/> remember my dear <persName

                <p> On the fourth day of her illness a change<lb/> took place and for a few day the
                    flattering<lb/> expectation that her life would be pre-<lb/> serv'd was
                    indulged, but a fever with<lb/> some other unfavourable symptoms seiz'd<lb/> her
                    which seemed to baffle all the efforts<lb/> that was given for her relief, and
                    felt nature<lb/> not having strength to resist yielded to their<lb/> powerful
                    assaults. -- she weaken'd fast<lb/> yet appear'd to lay with an easy mind.<lb/>

                    mov'd<lb/> often made the request. She would<lb/> look very affectionately at me
                    at times<lb/> and say, <q>Well father I feel very un-<lb/> easy, I believe I
                        must be mov'd a little,<lb/> I suppose thou wilt think me very<lb/>
                        bothersome, but it gives me some relief.</q><lb/> Tho’ it was moving to see
                    her so <lb/>
                    <pb n="61" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_61"/> afflicted yet I was glad I was with<lb/>
                    her, she appear'd so much in the inno-<lb/> cency, no anxiety manifested
                    concern-<lb/> ing her situation, her mind much<lb/> resign'd and a willingness
                    to comply<lb/> and act just as was thought best.</p>
                <p> The day she deceas'd her pain much<lb/> abating, she lay more easy tho’ a
                    high<lb/> fever was still her companion which<lb/> so affected her mind as to
                    cause it to<lb/> be much affloat particularly when in<lb/> a doze. About three
                    Oclock she appear'd<lb/> in fervent supplication tho’ not clearly<lb/>
                    understood, and frequently in the few<lb/> remaining hours that she continued
                    with<lb/> us her mind was similarly engag'd<lb/> not only interceding for
                    herself but others<lb/> which fully evinced that her day would<lb/> close in
                    peace. About this time her<lb/> hands and feet began to grow cold,<lb/> and her
                    pulse to beat more feebly tho’<lb/> very quick. I ask'd her if she knew <lb/>
                    <pb n="62" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_62"/> we were waiting to see her close. she<lb/>
                    said where are you waiting? I answer’d<lb/> around her bed. She reply'd <q>I am
                        very<lb/> low</q> -- About half an hour before her<lb/> departure I took
                    hold of her hand to<lb/> feel if she had a pulse, apprehending<lb/> she was too
                    far gone to notice it, but<lb/> she asked if she had any fever. I replied<lb/>
                    not much -- I then ask'd if she felt<lb/> very sick she answer'd no. I think
                    I<lb/> feel a little recruited, am pretty easy<lb/> and if I had a good place to
                    lay I<lb/> could go to sleep - I said <q>my dear child,<lb/> thou wilt soon be
                        in a sweet sleep.<lb/></q> she replied <q>I believe I shall</q> -- at<lb/>
                    this time a cold sweat was pouring<lb/> from her - and shortly after she said<lb/>
                    <q>I am in such a perspiration that<lb/> I cannot get my mind composed.<lb/> I
                        want to have it settled</q>- having<lb/> frequently thro’ the course of the
                    day<lb/> expressed the same desire -- she present- <lb/>
                    <pb n="63" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_63"/> -ly call'd for a cup of tea - which
                    was<lb/> brought to her - but she was in so great<lb/> a tremor that it was with
                    much diffi-<lb/> culty she drank it, and being sensible of<lb/> her situation
                    she said, <q>I am so discom-<lb/> posed that I can scarcely drink it.</q><lb/>
                    then having a little more she said <q>that<lb/> is sufficient.</q> -- she then
                    altered very<lb/> fast, - and in a few minutes without<lb/> struggle, sigh or
                    groan quietly breath'd<lb/> her last. ---- Thus this hand-<lb/> maid of the
                    Lord, in the meridian of<lb/> life, being in the 36th year of her age<lb/>
                    closed her days and is now without a<lb/> doubt receiving the rewards of her
                    faith-<lb/> fulness.</p>
                <p> A number of the Indian women<lb/> from the first of her illness untill her<lb/>
                    close manifested much concern for her<lb/> recovery, - bringing different kinds
                    of<lb/> herbs and roots for her relief as well as<lb/> giving from time to time
                    their best <lb/>
                    <pb n="64" facs="SW_RC1805_Page_64"/> advice; and when they heard she was<lb/>
                    no more, their countenances manifest-<lb/> ed much sorrow. ---- She departed<lb/>
                    <date when="1807-08-16">16 of the 8mo 1807</date>, ---- the next<lb/> day being
                    fixed on for her burial, invi-<lb/> tations were sent among the In-<lb/> dians,
                    &amp; near 20 of the graver sort attend'd<lb/> principally women, a number
                    coming<lb/> into the room, and after looking at the<lb/> corps in much
                    brokenness quietly took<lb/> their seats untill it was closed, which<lb/> was
                    not untill after a time of solemn<lb/> silence.- Several of the Indians who<lb/>
                    did not come in sent their excuse<lb/> saying, They could not bear to see
                    her<lb/> for the sight would overcome them and<lb/> they would weep aloud. They
