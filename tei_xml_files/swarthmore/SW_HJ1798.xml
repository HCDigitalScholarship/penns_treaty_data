                <p>The manuscript of Halliday Jackson’s <emph>Genesinguhta</emph> is housed at
                    Friends Historical Library, on the campus of Swarthmore College. In the fall
                    semester of 2010, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A (“Reading Red,
                    White, and In-Between in Early American Literature”) transcribed Jackson’s
                    manuscript as part of a larger project to make the library’s rich store of
                    Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible to researchers. The project was
                    designed by Christopher Densmore, curator of Friends Historical Library, and
                    Keat Murray, Visiting Assistant Professor of English. Transcribers included:
                    Professor Murray (Title -3), Tiffany Lee (4-26), Youda Cao (27-55), and Brent
                    Stanfield (56-61). Students’ transcriptions were compiled and edited in the
                    present form by Professor Murray. </p>
            </projectDesc>
            <editorialDecl>
                <p> Jackson does not include page numbers on his manuscript; the page numbers have
                    been interpolated by the transcribers to correspond with the manuscript sheets.
                    In this case, the title page is counted as the first page.</p>

                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render Halliday Jackson’s orthography
                    and grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when Jackson’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, some questions remain about
                    spelling the names of Jackson’s Quaker acquaintances, individual Native
                    Americans who populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The
                    transcribers and editor attempted to remain faithful to Jackson’s Anglicized
                    spellings in all cases. </p>

                    good state of health, and we do know that<lb/> many of you have sympathizing
                    Hearts<lb/> with us, and very tender feelings for the good<lb/> of those People
                    we are placed amongst; there<lb/>fore we feel duty bound to write to you at<lb/>
                    every convenient opportunity, letting you<lb/> know how the business we are
                    entrusted with is<lb/> going on amongst us. </p>
                <p> The Indians continue to treat us with<lb/> great civility and respect, and we
                    believe there<lb/> is no cause of discouragement in the present<lb/> undertaking
                    amongst them; though we cannot<lb/> expect a great deal done by them at
                    Farming<lb/> until they are better supplied with<lb/> working Creatures— <lb/>
                    <pb n="2" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_05"/> We have assisted them in building several
                    houses and<lb/> have made a considerable progress in Farming on our<lb/> own Lot
                    for what time we have been on it; our<lb/> Corn, Potatoes Garden etc. affords a
                    beautiful<lb/> aspect, and we intend to sow some Wheat and Rye<lb/> this Fall if
                    we can procure Seed, which can-<lb/>not be obtained nearer than <placeName

                    <salute>Dear Friends,</salute></opener>
                <p> At a meeting of the Indian<lb/> Committee held last month, your joint
                    Letter<lb/> was read the contents whereof was very satisfactory<lb/> to such of
                    the Members as were present, who<lb/> were few in number owing to a renewed
                    dispensation of sickness<lb/> and Mortality which has been permitted<lb/> again
                    to visit poor <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>, and which<lb/>
                    though most prevalent in the Northern &amp;<lb/> Southern extremities of the
                    City has spread<lb/> pretty generally thro' it, and driven the<lb/> Greater part
                    of the inhabitants from their<lb/> Homes; and by the latest accounts I have<lb/>
                    received of those that remain, from fifty<lb/> to sixty are daily removed from
                    this muta<lb/>ble state—</p>
                <p> I (with my family) have been removed <lb/>

                <p>Since we wrote to you we received<lb/> a letter from <persName key="twist1"
                        >Thomas Wistar</persName> which gave us an<lb/> account that the Yellow

                        >Philadelphia</placeName>,<lb/> no doubt but it has been a very distressing
                    time<lb/> to many--We have been employed the<lb/> latter part of this Season in
                    building a comfortable two<lb/> story log house 18 by 22 feet, covered with<lb/>
                    Pine Shingles, Sellar’d underneath, and the<lb/> Chimney composed of Stone and

                    <salute> Dear Friends,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p> We have written two letters to you<lb/> since our settling here the last of
                    which was dated<lb/>
                    <date when="1798-11-16">16 of 11 mo 98</date>, and altho’ we have received
                    no<lb/> answer from you in a Collective capacity we<lb/> doubt not but many of
                    you sympathize with<lb/> us, and we are often mercifully favored to feel
                    the<lb/> help of your Spirits cooperating and strength- <lb/>
                    <pb n="7" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_10"/> -ening us in our present engagement—<lb/>We
                    expect there are letters from you delayed at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh </placeName> or <placeName key="frank"
                        >Franklin</placeName> for want of opportunities<lb/> of forwarding them to
                    us, which is very rare<lb/> at this Season of the Year otherwise we would
                    write<lb/> oftener to you than we do </p>
                <p> We received a plentiful increase of the most<lb/> of our Summer produce, and
                    also prepared ground<lb/> to sow several bushels of Winter Grain, but the<lb/>
                    River being so low we got disappointed in getting<lb/> Seed, altho’ we wrote to
                        <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName> for it soon<lb/> after Harvest
                    and our Agents there forwarded<lb/> it to <placeName key="frank"
                        >Franklin</placeName> for us—We expect it to<lb/> come forward in the Spring
                    and do to sow<lb/> another year—Several of the Young Indians<lb/> manifest some
                    inclination to take up work, and<lb/> last fall we had one employ'd a while at
                    our<lb/> business—We have kept up a School at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="conis">Conishadaga</placeName> this Winter in one of the
                    Indians<lb/> Houses where from 12 to 25 Children have attended<lb/> who appear
                    to make as much progress in learn-<lb/>ing-<lb/>
                    <pb n="8" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_11"/> as can reasonably be expected: and we have
                    had<lb/> in contemplation the propriety of erecting a<lb/> School house at that
                    place the ensuing Summer<lb/> as the Children are principally there, we
                    think<lb/> it will be of the most general utility, which<lb/> we submit to
                    You—The most of the<lb/> Cloth, Linen, etc. which You sent with us, we<lb/> have
                    exchang'd for Meat, Boards, and other<lb/> Necessaries we stood in need of, and
                    a little of<lb/> it we sold for money to accommodate they<lb/> Indians at a
                    price to reimburse the accruing expen<lb/>ses of bringing it here— </p>
                <p> We think it will be necessary for us to be furnish'd<lb/> with a Yoke of Oxen to
                    go on with Farming the<lb/> ensuing Summer, as one of our horses is a<lb/>
                    little lame and the ground very hard to break<lb/> up and we wish to be able to
                    assist they Indians<lb/> a little at Farming—We sent you word in<lb/> our last
                    letter that we had purchased a dry Cow<lb/> which we since find is not likely to
                    supply us with<lb/> Milk, and if a Yoke of Oxen is sent it would be<lb/>
                    <pb n="9" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_12"/> a great accommodation to us if a good
                    Milk<lb/> Cow was sent with them, and the one we have at<lb/> present will do
                    for Beef next Fall</p>
                <p> We also think it may tend to the promotion<lb/> of the work and believe it
                    expedient to Submit<lb/> to you the consideration of sending us the<lb/>
                    following articles as early as practicable next<lb/> Spring to Wit </p>

                    <salute> Dear Friends </salute></opener>

                <p> I wrote to you (I think) some<lb/> time in the last month from
                        <placeName>Monmouth<lb/> County, New Jersey</placeName> to which place I had
                    remo-<lb/>ved with my Family on account of the aw<lb/>ful visitation of Sickness
                    under which many<lb/> of the inhabitants of this City were then labor<lb/>ing,
                    and which continued until about the<lb/> 5th of this month when it pleased
                    the<lb/> great disposer of events to cause a dispensation<lb/> of more general
                    health—In the course of<lb/> about three months, near three thousand<lb/> five
                    hundred of my fellow Citizens have been<lb/>
                    <pb n="12" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_15"/> removed from this Earthly Scene in the
                    City—<lb/>and many have ended their lives in the neigh-<lb/>boring country: But
                    it is not <placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName><lb/> alone that has to
                    mourn her slain, several parts<lb/> of the country adjacent lossed some of
                    their<lb/> most valuable Members—About thirteen<lb/> of the friends who came to
                    the City at the<lb/> usual time of holding the Yearly Meeting were<lb/> by this
                    Disease removed (amongst whom<lb/> were <persName key="wmiff1">Warner

                <p> The neighboring Villages particularly those<lb/> on the <geogName key="delaw"
                        >Delaware</geogName> were Deep snares in this great<lb/> affliction, of

                        key="wilmi">Wilming<lb/>ton</placeName> were most Conspicuous, as in the
                    first<lb/> thirty-seven Persons are said to have died, and<lb/> of the remainder
                    of the inhabitants it is<lb/> also said but five families staid in their
                    Ha-<lb/>bitations, the others seeking safety in flight<lb/> which also was

                    <pb n="13" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_16"/> where the mortality was such that three
                    Sisters<lb/> were seen carried at one time in one Cart to their<lb/> Graves—The

                    that<lb/> so many of our worthy Friends laid down<lb/> their lives in the

                    necessary to carry the work into effect<lb/> pretty early this Spring—Numbers
                    of<lb/> them propose building more comfortable<lb/>
                    <pb n="16" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_19"/> Dwellings for themselves the ensuing
                    Summer<lb/> &amp; request our assistance and instruction therein,<lb/> and we
                    are not without a hope that some of them<lb/> will take up farming also, altho’
                    the want of Do-<lb/>mestic animals is a great impediment in<lb/> their way—</p>
                <p> Five of us have been mostly employ'd in<lb/> Mechanical Business at our
                    Settlement the<lb/> late Winter have prepared Plows and other<lb/> necessary
                    implements of Husbandry, and also<lb/> made a good deal of Cooper ware and
                    other<lb/> Articles which we exchange with they Indians<lb/> for Sugar and other
                    house necessaries—</p>
                <p> We have lately had some serious considera<lb/>tions about taking an Indian Lad
                    as we<lb/> think it may tend to the promotion of<lb/> the work &amp; that he may
                    be useful to us, but<lb/> are willing to submit the matter to you—</p>
                <p> We are also united in Judgement, that<lb/> if a well-qualified family should
                    offer they<lb/> may be encouraged to come forward this <lb/>
                    <pb n="17" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_20"/> Spring in order to make a more
                    permanent<lb/> settlement at this place, as there is a probabili<lb/>ty of our
                    business being a good deal scattered,<lb/> and suitable accommodations will be
                    pro<lb/>vided for this reception—</p>
                <p> Having lately wrote pretty largely to<lb/> you we have little to "alleghany"
                    only that we<lb/> continue to enjoy our health, and that<lb/> you are often

                    <salute> Dear Friends,</salute></opener>
                <p>The occasion of our writing<lb/> to you at this time is on account of the

                    they<lb/> have an Idea that they ought to be partakers<lb/> of the instruction
                    and assistance our society<lb/> have propos'd affording that People— </p>
                <p> Their present situation is favourable for the<lb/> promotion of civilization

                <p>Since we wrote to you last<lb/> we received your very acceptable letter of the<lb/>
                    <date when="1799-02-19">2nd mo. 19th last</date>, which is the first we
                    have<lb/> receiv'd from you jointly since our settling here<lb/> – Some weeks
                    since we received a few<lb/> lines from <persName key="twist1">Thomas
                        Wistar</persName>&amp; <persName key="tstew1">Thomas -<lb/>

                    Yoke of Oxen, which accord-<lb/>ingly was done, and explor'd the
                    settlements<lb/> as far as <placeName key="ffran">Fort Franklin</placeName> in
                    quest of a Cow<lb/> but could find none for Sale. The price<lb/>
                    <persName key="gwilk1">General Wilkins</persName> had fix'd on the Oxen was<lb/>
                    one hundred Dollars, but we are now of the<lb/> Judgment 80 Dollars is their
                    full value.<lb/> They are nearly Old enough to turn off</p>
                <p> We know of no opportunity at present<lb/> of getting a Cow but we hope to avail
                    our<lb/>selves of one by some means in the<lb/> course of this Summer – We think<lb/>
                    <pb n="25" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_28"/> we have 8 or 9 Acres of our Wilderness
                    bottom<lb/> Clear'd, have got 4 Acres of Corn in the<lb/> Ground, 5 Bushels of

                    plow'd several small lots<lb/> for the Indians near us and divers of the<lb/>
                    men have assisted in the Labor of the Field.<lb/> One has fenc'd in a farm near
                    us and more<lb/> are about doing it – We have erected a<lb/> commodious

                    Indians assisted us in doing,<lb/> and also found materials for it </p>
                <p> Altho’ we find sufficient encouragement<lb/> to persevere in the work, we cannot
                    but<lb/> lament the evil effects produced by an<lb/> intemperate use of
                    Spirituous Liquors<lb/> amongst those poor people – The procured<lb/> much of it

                    Skins, Furrs, &amp;c., which has caused us<lb/> some renewed engagement of mind
                    to bear a Testimo<lb/>ny <lb/>
                    <pb n="26" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_29"/> against it, and qualification was

                    <salute>Dear Friends,</salute></opener>
                <p> Your letter of 1st mo. 23rd<lb/> was received and read in the Committee for
                    Indian<lb/> affairs at their meeting Last month, its General<lb/> contents
                    affording satisfaction a renewal of that<lb/> general sympathy was felt which
                    frequently<lb/> accompanies our minds on your behalf,<lb/> secluded as you are
                    from the Society you<lb/> have been accustomed to: yet where an evidence<lb/>
                    attends the mind that we are in our proper<lb/> allotments in obedience to him
                    who has a right<lb/> to our Services in such situations and exercises<lb/> of
                    duty as He is pleased to manifest, those<lb/> things which would otherwise be
                    very trying<lb/> and Irksome are made easy –</p>
                <p> your intimation of a prospect that one of<lb/> you might during the winter
                    season profit<lb/>ably reside at the Lower Village to instruct<lb/> the Children
                    in School Learning has<lb/> claimed our serious deliberation, and we <lb/>
                    <pb n="28" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_31"/> are free to suggest that you rather
                    encourage<lb/> some of the Indians to second a few of their Chil-<lb/>dren to
                    reside near you in winter – perhaps<lb/> by so doing the school will be smaller,
                    but<lb/> we hope quite as useful to such as do attend<lb/> and afford you more
                    comfort and satisfaction,<lb/> believeing you will strengthen and encourage<lb/>
                    one another and be less exposed by resideing<lb/> as much together as may be –
                    we would<lb/> not wish to be understood as disapproveing<lb/> of the trial

                <p>We have had no accounts from<lb/> you since your letter of the 4th mo. 13th
                    which<lb/> accompanied the Articles you sent us, all of<lb/> which we received

                    sending their Children to our village to be<lb/> instructed in School Learning
                    we are again<lb/> free to suggest to you that we believe it will<lb/> afford the

                    the School<lb/> to be kept at the lower village, while three suita<lb/>ble

                    but little<lb/> hopes of them comeing nearer to us – But<lb/> the prospect of
                    one of us returning this Fall will<lb/> probably prevent the School being kept at<lb/>

                <p> We received your letter in<lb/> Company with the one you wrote to <persName
                        key="cornp2">Captain<lb/> Obeal</persName>, and are glad to find you got a

                    determined to take their<lb/> advice and have already swallow’d it down in<lb/>

                <p>Brothers,</p>
                <p>We are glad to hear that you have come<lb/> to a resolution to lay up so much of
                    your money<lb/> in order to buy Cattle and other useful articles<lb/> and that
                    you are determined to quit drinking<lb/> Whisky and not to allow any traders to
                    sell it<lb/> on your Ground –</p>
                <p> Now Brothers this is a very Wise resolution<lb/> in you, and we hope you will be
                    sincere and<lb/> keep to it – We heartily wish all the Indian Tribes<lb/> would
                    join you in driveing Whisky and Rum out<lb/> of the Land – We hope some of you
                    have got<lb/> your eyes opened to see that Whisky and Strong<lb/> drink has been
                    the Cause of much Evil and wicked-<lb/>ness among you, and that it has taken
                    away much<lb/> of your money, your skins, &amp; your furrs, which<lb/> the great
                    Spirit has given you to buy Blankets<lb/> and Clotheing, &amp; oxen, axes and
                    hoes, and other<lb/> useful articles to assist you in tilling the field –<lb/>
                    and we fear in time past it has taken away some<lb/> of the Corn your poor Women

                <p> Brothers, </p>

                <p> You must know there are many White <lb/>
                    <pb n="40" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_43"/> People that love money, and they know that
                    you<lb/> love Whisky, and this is the way they take to<lb/> get your money and
                    Property from you, but<lb/> if you keep to your resolution not to drink it<lb/>
                    then there will be no danger, you will then<lb/> have money to buy Oxen and
                    Plows to plow<lb/> your Ground and raise a great deal of Corn, and<lb/> to buy
                    axes and Hoes and other useful Articles to<lb/> go to Farming with, and then
                    when your Brothers<lb/> the Quakers see that you are trying to do good for<lb/>
                    your selves, and makeing good use of your money<lb/> it will encourage them to
                    help you more –</p>
                <p> Brothers,</p>
                <p> We desire you often to think upon the<lb/> Great Spirrit, and pray to him in

                    and we want you to take up work like<lb/> the White people, for your land we
                        <del>think</del> believe is<lb/> very good and will produce a great deal of
                    Grain if<lb/> you are industrious, and when you get plenty of<lb/> Cattle, and
                    Sheep, and Swine, they will afford you<lb/> plenty of meat, and be much easier
                    taken than<lb/> the Elk, the Deer, &amp; the Bear – Then will your<lb/> Old men,

                    <salute> Dear Friends,</salute></opener>
                <p> Our last was dated <date when="1799-11-10">11 mo. 10th</date> since<lb/> which
                    we have received no intelligence from you<lb/> either collectively or
                    individually – </p>
                <p> Our Living here the present Winter is in a good<lb/> degree comfortable and we
                    are encouraged to hope<lb/> we shall experience an addition to our number
                    the<lb/> ensuing Summer whereby one of us may be<lb/> released from the present
                    engagement <lb/>
                    <pb n="42" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_45"/> A Smith would be very desirable and we
                    think ex-<lb/>tensively useful at this place – </p>
                <p> We have kept up a school at our house the present<lb/> Winter where several
                    small children have attended<lb/> and make some progress in learning – and
                    an<lb/> Indian Lad about 13 years of age is now resideing<lb/> with us, whom we
                    have a prospect of keeping to<lb/> instruct in our business – </p>
                <p> We have lately received a letter from the Indians<lb/> of <placeName
                        key="catta1">Cattaraugus Village</placeName>, who appear to continue<lb/>
                    their prospect of looking toward us for assistance<lb/> and instruction –on
                    serious deliberation on<lb/> the subject we felt easy to write them an
                    answer<lb/> in order to strengthen and encourage them in<lb/> the resolutions
                    the appear to have adopted, a<lb/> copy of which with the letter the sent us is
                    here<lb/> enclosed for your perusal – What ever result<lb/> may take place in
                    the Committee respecting those<lb/> Indians, we are free to suggest, if nothing
                    further<lb/> is attempted for their advancement in civilization,<lb/> whether or
                    no a few Axes &amp; Hoes or such like use-<lb/>ful articles; would not be
                    expedient to send among<lb/> them in order to support that Friendship and<lb/>
                    Confidence they appear to have in our Society –<lb/>And if the Committee should
                    see cause to afford<lb/>
                    <pb n="43" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_46"/> them a few of those useful articles we
                    think if they<lb/> were deposited in our care the Indians would not think<lb/>
                    hard of coming to us for them – In the mean time<lb/> if we should have further
                    intercourse with that people<lb/> we mean to extend our inquiries into their
                    conduct<lb/> and situation, and transmit our knowledge thereof<lb/> to you –</p>
                <p> A few articles may be necessary to send forward in the<lb/> Spring for our
                    accommodations here, of such as we<lb/> recollect at present is – Chocolate Tea,
                    2 Bushels<lb/> of fine Salt – a short piece of Strong Cloth – 1 do of
                    strong<lb/> shirten linen, some Candle wick – 1 doz nail Gimblet<lb/> 100 Sprigs
                    – 6 plain bits &amp; an Almanack –</p>
                <p> The Cloth and linen is intended for the accommoda<lb/>tion of the Family here –
                    we don’t desire any more<lb/> to traffic with the Indians, and if a Smith
                    should<lb/> come forward some more Tools, Iron &amp; Steele per-<lb/>haps will
                    be necessary All which we submit to<lb/> you, and being well in health remain

                <p> Your Letter to the Committee<lb/> on Indian affairs dated 16 Ultimate was<lb/>
                    duly received and afforded much satisfaction<lb/> to find you were preserved in

                    inclemency of the present Season. </p>
                <p> Various consideration have induced the<lb/> Committee to believe it right to

                    – Several<lb/> of the Indians have been instructed in the<lb/> best mode of

                    our brothers the Indi-<lb/>ans whom they are endeavouring to instruct<lb/> in

                    –We were also at <placeName key="catta1">Cataraugus</placeName> and would<lb/>

                <note resp="author">The following is copied from a Newspaper<lb/> 1 mo. 1811</note>
                <opener>To the Legislature of Virginia</opener>
                <p>The Memorial and Petition of the<lb/> religious society of friends commonly
                    called Quakers<lb/> Respectfully showeth:<lb/> That your Memo-<lb/>rialists
                    expanding the high regard with which<lb/> the Legislature will be disposed to
                    consider every<lb/> Subject <del>with which the Legislature will be
                        dis-<lb/>posed to consider ever ry</del> affecting the great<lb/> principals
                    of civil and religious liberty beg leave<lb/> to solicit your attention to the
                    militia laws of<lb/> this Commonwealth and to the incompatibility<lb/> which
                    sometimes results between the requisition of<lb/> Law and the obligations of
                    religious duty.</p>
                <p> For this enlightened age and country and before this<lb/> Legislature your
                    memorialists conceive it unnecessary<lb/> to urge the unalienable rights of
                    conscience as to<lb/> adduce any arguments to show that the relations<lb/>
                    between man and his <del>maker</del> Creator neither can<lb/> nor ought to be
                    prescribed by any human authority.<lb/> It is unnecessary because the
                    preposition <gap/> is self<lb/> evident and especially because it is one of the
                    fun-<lb/>damental principals when which the civil and<lb/> political
                    institutions of this country are<lb/> established. </p>

                <pb n="49" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_52"/>
                <p>This principal is recognized in the bill of rights<lb/> it is confirmed by the
                    law of 1785 passed in the<lb/> enlightened and liberal spirit of that
                    instrument<lb/> and the state itself by its convention which rati<lb/>-fied the
                    federal constitution explicitly declared that “the<lb/> liberty of conscience
                    cannot be canceled or abridged<lb/> restrained or modified by any authority of
                    the U. St.</p>
                <p> The free exercise of religion therefore is not mere-<lb/>-ly tolerated, it is
                    declared in the most solemn<lb/> form; it is confirmed in the most explicit
                    manner.</p>
                <p> But the liberty of conscience your memorialists<lb/> conceive cannot be
                    restricted to the mere liberty<lb/> of thinking or to the violent and unseen
                    modification<lb/> of religious opinion – Religion has duties to be
                    performed<lb/> and it points out offences to be avoided; its free exercise
                    must<lb/> therefore consist in an active compliance with its<lb/> dictates
                    enforced by no legal compulsion restrained by<lb/> no legal impediment.</p>
                <p> Your memorialists in common with every virtuous<lb/> citizen would disdain any
                    execution under the colour<lb/> of religious liberty from the universal
                    obligations of<lb/> moral duty but the law of 1789 in making – <lb/>“overt acts”
                    of an injurious nature the limit of the<lb/> privilege and the criterion of its
                    abuse removes all<lb/> danger to the community. An encroachment<lb/> on the
                    rights of other as evolution of the moral<lb/> law under pretence of liberty of
                    conscience would<lb/> immediately betray its own guilt and hypocrisy<lb/> and
                    afford a legitimate cause for the interposition<lb/> of the civil authority.</p>
                <p> More considerations are suggested as applicable<lb/> to the cause which is now
                    submitted to the wis<lb/>-dom and justice of the Legislature. </p>

                <pb n="50" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_53"/>
                <p> Your memorialists are christians and im-<lb/>-pressed with a firm conviction
                    that war<lb/> is forbidden under the Gosple – they cannot<lb/> bear Arms – to
                    require it under legal penalties<lb/> is to reduce them to the alternative of
                    refuseing<lb/> a compliance with the laws of their country<lb/> as of violating
                    what they most solemnly believe<lb/> is to them a law of God, clothed with the
                    most<lb/> awful sanctions </p>
                <p> Your memorialist plead for no new doctrine<lb/> the set up no novel pretentions.
                    The ask permissi-<lb/>-on only to practice the precepts of Jesus Christ.<lb/> To
                    adhere to a principal which prevailed through<lb/> the first centuries of the
                    Christian dispensation<lb/> which pious men through every subsequent age
                    have<lb/> maintained, and which their predecessors from the<lb/> time they have
                    been known as a religious society<lb/> under various forms of Government and
                    through<lb/> suffering imposed by rigorous and persecuting<lb/> laws, have
                    uniformly supported.</p>
                <p> It is true that in the laps of time the Spirit of<lb/> time - the Spirit of
                    persecution has faded before the<lb/> light of truth. Our own Country as
                    already<lb/> stated has been particularly distinguished for<lb/> maintaining the
                    principals of civility and reli-<lb/>-gious liberty and for rejecting those of
                    coercive law<lb/> and religious intolerance. The very grievance<lb/> to which we
                    now solicit your attention has been<lb/> acknowledged and redefined. A
                    Legislature composed<lb/> of <lb/>
                    <pb n="51" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_54"/> enlightened statesmen and sages who had
                    assisted<lb/> in establishing the chartered rights of America<lb/> who had seen
                    the principals which your memorial-<lb/>-ists maintain tested through the
                    revolutionary<lb/> war convinced it is believed of their sincerity<lb/> and of
                    the Justice of their claims, exempted the<lb/>m from the obligation to bear arms
                    and from<lb/> certain fines and penalties which had been impo-<lb/>-sed on their
                    non-compliance with military<lb/> requisitions. But the laws are changed.
                    They<lb/> now require that your memorialists, notwith<lb/>-standing
                        the<del>ir</del>
                    <gap/> objections of their<lb/> religious scruples should be trained to arms.
                    Their<lb/> refusal subjects them to fines which within certain<lb/> limitations
                        <del>subjects them</del> are fixed at the discretion<lb/> of the Court
                    Martial and become in numerous<lb/> instances extremely oppressive. Nor is this
                    all your<lb/> memorialists conceive that the voluntary payment<lb/> of a fine
                    imposed, for adherence to religious duty or<lb/> the receiving of surplus money
                    arising from the<lb/> sale of their property seized for the satisfying of
                    these<lb/> demands, <del>but</del> would be to acknowledge a delinquen<lb/>-cy
                    which they cannot admit and to become parties<lb/> in a traffic or commutation
                    of their principals.<lb/> Hence also considerable loss is sustained. And<lb/>
                    notwithstanding your memorialists may<lb/> acknowledge that many officers in the
                    government<lb/> in these cases manifest great reluctance, and<lb/> execute their
                    trust with a scrupulous regard to<lb/>
                    <pb n="52" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_55"/> the interest of the sufferers: yet there
                    are<lb/> others in which wanton depredations are made<lb/> on the property of
                    individuals </p>
                <p> Your memorialists are aware that it may be said<lb/> that the law does not
                    discriminate between them &amp;<lb/> others and that they ought equally to
                    support the<lb/> public burthens, and yield their services to the
                    exigen-<lb/>ces of the state. This objection supposes that a general<lb/> law
                    cannot have a partial or unequal operation.<lb/> It supposes that what may be
                    deemed a nati-<lb/>onal concern may supersede the chartered rights &amp;<lb/>
                    and privileges of the people. But your memorialists<lb/> cannot suppose that
                    these principals which indeed<lb/> are no other than the maxims of tyrant will
                    ever<lb/> be deliberately adopted and acted upon by this<lb/> legislature. If
                    one member of the community<lb/> believe that it is duty to fight and to slay
                    the<lb/> enemies of his country, and if another believe<lb/> that he is
                    prohibited by divine command from<lb/> planning the destruction of shedding the
                    blood of<lb/> his fellow creatures, the question as it relates to the<lb/>
                    present subject is not which or whether either is wrong<lb/> but whether a law
                    commanding both to take up<lb/> arms would not operate unequally and
                    violate<lb/> the rites of conscience? It would operate unequal<lb/>-ly because
                    it does not discriminate because to<lb/> the conscience of the one it does not
                    enjoin the<lb/> performance of a duty, to that of the other the<lb/> commission
                    of a crime. It would violate the<lb/> liberty of conscience because it would compel<lb/>
                    <pb n="53" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_56"/> under pains and penalties the performance
                    of<lb/> an act which is believed offensive to the divine being.</p>
                <p> Human authority cannot like the Great<lb/> searcher of hearts try the Spirits of
                    men respecting<lb/> truth and error, it cannot remit the penalties<lb/> of sin
                    or controll the convictions of the heart and<lb/> therefore in this country at
                    least the liberty of<lb/> conscience is wisely plac'd beyond the Sphere of<lb/>
                    legislation, and protected from the encroachments<lb/> of any power in the
                    government.</p>
                <p> It may be recollected too that in every nation<lb/> of the civilized world,
                    where this society is found they<lb/> profess and maintain the same principals,
                    that no<lb/> hope of reward no dread of punishment, not confis-<lb/>cations
                    imprisonment or death, would induce them to<lb/> bear arms against this Country,
                    as in any other<lb/> cause whatever and that every attempt to coerce<lb/> them
                    would result on the one side in the Triumph<lb/> of principal however severely
                    tested, and with un-<lb/>availing persecution on the other. While it is
                    there<lb/>fore evident that the ostensible object of the Law<lb/> or training
                    them to arms - cannot be effective<lb/> and it is presumed from the general
                    notori\e/ty of their<lb/> principals that it is not even expected to be
                    attain<lb/>-ed- while your memoriallists believe that the<lb/> principals they
                    hold can in no sence prove<lb/> injurious to the community, and are
                    persua<lb/>-ded that this Legislature would disclaim the<lb/> Idea of raising
                    revenue by laws inflicting fines<lb/> on the free exercise of conscience they
                    trust that<lb/> a privilege conferred by the Supreme being and <lb/>
                    <pb n="54" facs="SW_HJ1798_Page_57"/> by the highest authority in this Country
                    decla-<lb/>red to be sacred and inviolable may be safe-<lb/>ly expected from its
                    justice and liberality.<lb/> They therefore respectfully petition that the<lb/>
                    Laws imposing military requisitions and<lb/> penalties for non-compliance may be
                    consi-<lb/>-dered as they respect your petitioners and such<lb/> relief afforded
                    as wisdom of the Legislature<lb/> shall deem just and necessary.</p>
