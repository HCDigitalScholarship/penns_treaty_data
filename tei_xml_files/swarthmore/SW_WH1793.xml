                <p>The Hartshorne journal is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of
                    Swarthmore College. During 2014 staff of Friends Historical Library and
                    Swarthmore College students began a project to encode seventeen journals which
                    document interaction between Quakers and Native Americans in New York State and
                    Ohio between 1793 and 1806.</p>

                    o'clock in the evening left New York in order<lb/> to attend the Treaty to be

                    not esteemed<lb/> very pleasing. At <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> we

                    with considerable<lb/> difficulty, and many hours delay, at length<lb/> procured
                    a Horse and Chair, and without an<lb/> Attendant, about 6 in the Evening, set

                    falsehoods had been intimated by American Com-<lb/>missioners at former treaties
                    with the Indians, in<lb/> respect to the British Government ceeding to the<lb/>
                    United States the absolute property of the Indian<lb/> Country, as the price of
                    Peace, - nothing more<lb/> being intended by that Article of the Treaty,
                    than<lb/> the right of preemption, which he fully acknow<lb/>-ledged, and said
                    that the British Government had no<lb/> right to purchase Lands of the Indians
                    within<lb/> the limits mark'd out by the Treaty - He fur-<lb/>ther said that the
                    Indians had been treated<lb/> with cruelty and injustice, and that it was<lb/>
                    his opinion they never would make peace<lb/> except the <geogName key="ohior"
                        >River Ohio</geogName> was made the boundary<lb/> line. - He further said
                    that scandalous<lb/> falsehoods had been propagated in the News<lb/> papers of
                    the United States, respecting the<lb/> British still keeping possession of the

                <p> This morning the Rain abated - took<lb/> a walk up the River.- immediately from

                    as far<lb/> as I could discover, the Banks of the River,<lb/> from the Landing
                    to the Falls, <del><gap/></del><lb/> of the heigth, perhaps from 150 to 200
                    feet,<lb/>are almost perpendicular, the greatest part<lb/>of solid Rock, it
                    being the opinion of many,<lb/> that the Falls were originally near the Landing,
                    but the<lb/> prodigious Body of Water that precipitates down<lb/> them, has worn
                    the channel, 6 or 7 miles up<lb/> to its present situation – from a high
                    point<lb/> on the West Bank, had a view of the River<lb/> down to the Lake, and
                    by a small pocket<lb/> Compass found that Fort <placeName key="niaga"
                        >Niagara</placeName> bore from<lb/> one N. by W. – In the afternoon
                        <persName key="wsave1">Wm. Savery</persName><lb/> and myself went on Horse

                    found the country thickly<lb/> inhabited, all new settlements.- The River<lb/>
                    just above the Falls I suppose to be a mile<lb/> wide, and the depth in some
                    places 6 or 8 feet,<lb/> this prodigious body of water, conjectured to be<lb/>
                    more than double the quantity that comes down<lb/> the Falls of Delaware near
                    Trenton, with<lb/>
                    <pb n="18" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_18"/> amazing rapiddity shoots over the edge of
                    a<lb/> solid perpendicular Rock, and Falls (according to<lb/>
                    A. Elliotts account) 137 feet
                        -<del><gap/></del><lb/><del><gap/></del><lb/> - for about a mile above the
                    great Fall, there is<lb/> a continued succession of Cataracts, some of<lb/> them
                    3 or 4 feet perpendicular, this greatly en-<lb/>creases the rapiddity of the
                    current, until it comes<lb/> to the edge of the Precipice, over which it dashes
                        -<del><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/></del></p>
                <p> The River at the Falls is divided by a small<lb/> flat Island, of perhaps 250
                    yards in width, and twice<lb/> that number in length - the sides and upper
                    end,<lb/> not much elevated above the surface of the River<lb/> above the Falls,
                    the lower end, which is on a line<lb/> with the Falls, is a smooth perpendicular
                    Rook, I suppose<lb/> of about 150 feet high.- The edge of the Rock over<lb/>
                    which the water Falls, on the East side of the Island,<lb/><del><gap/></del>, is
                    nearly a straight line,<lb/> and the River, on that side, I suppose to be 250
                    yards<lb/> wide, but the Water not so deep as on the West side<lb/>
                    <pb n="19" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_19"/> where its width is the
                        same<del><gap/></del> - the<lb/> edge of the Rook, on this side, forms near
                        about<del><gap/></del><lb/> half a Circle, the convex side
                        upwards<del><gap/><lb/><gap/><lb/><gap/></del><lb/> --The quantity of Water
                    that passes on the West side,<lb/> I suppose to be double that which passes on
                    the<lb/> East side of the Island, being in the middle 6 or 8<lb/> feet deep
                    above the Falls.- It is said that by<lb/> actual survey there is found to be 50
                    feet fall in the<lb/> one mile of Rapids just above the Falls, and<lb/> from
                    thence down to the Landing, 6 or 7 miles,<lb/> the rappidity of the River
                    renders it altogether<lb/> impassable, in that distance the fall must be<lb/>
                    very considerable, so that taking the whole<lb/> into view, we may conclude,
                    that the surface<lb/> of the Water of <geogName key="lakee">Lake
                    Erie</geogName>, is nearly 300 feet above<lb/> that of <geogName key="lakeo"
                        >Lake Ontario</geogName>, the distance between these<lb/> Lakes being only

                <p> On coming upon Deck this morning we<lb/> were agree­ably surprised to find
                    ourselves sailing<lb/> up a fine River, with Plantations of new settlers<lb/> on
                    both sides - the father we advanced up, the<lb/> beauty of the prospect
                    increased, and when we<lb/> came within 6 or 7 miles of the Town, a sight<lb/>
                    of the kind more pleasing, I think I never saw.</p>
                <pb n="22" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_22"/>
                <p> The Country here was first settled<lb/> by the French, it is said above one
                    hundred years ago,<lb/> whose decendants, in a general way, are still the<lb/>
                    Proprietors, and by whom that Language (with<lb/> but few exceptions) is only
                    spoken. - The front<lb/> of each Lot on the River being but narrow, is<lb/>
                    almost wholly taken up with Buildings, Gardens<lb/> and fine thrifty orchards,
                    so that it has almost<lb/> the appearance oft one continu­ ous Village quite
                    up<lb/> to the Town - we sometimes could count four<lb/> or five Windmills in
                    sight at once, and a<lb/> pretty large Romish Chapple stands on the East<lb/>
                    side of the River, about 4 miles above the town.<lb/>- about 9 A.M. came to an
                    Anchor before<lb/> the Town of <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, - the
                    distance from the<lb/> mouth of the River 18 miles - course N b E<lb/> - Detroit
                    stands on the west side of the River, is<lb/> a compact dirty little Town,
                    containing about 100<lb/> small Houses, entirely surrounded by a picquet<lb/>
                    Wall, having several Gates which are always shut at 9 oClo.<lb/> - The Merchants
                    of this place carry on a great<lb/> Trade with the Indians, 8 or 10 Vessells
                    being em-<lb/>ployed by them on the Lakes, who sail from <placeName key="ferie"
                        >Fort<lb/> Erie</placeName> in a Circuitous rout, sometimes to the
                    dis-<lb/>tance of above 1000 miles to the Westward.</p>

                    exclusive of Liquor - Imported Goods<lb/> are double the price they are in
                    the<lb/> United States, and Country produce nearly<lb/> as high - a good calf is
                    sold for £4.10 N.Y. Curr.,<lb/> a Cow for £15.-, - Wheat 12/ per Bushel, -<lb/>
                    Salt 60/ per bushel. Soon after our arrival<lb/> went out to visit Captain John
                    a Chief<lb/> of the <geogName key="mohaw">Mohawk</geogName>s, and other Indians,
                    who were<lb/> our fellow passengers on board the Dunmore,<lb/> we found them
                    sober, and had some friendly<lb/> conversation with them, endeavoring to<lb/>
                    inform them of our motives of leaving<lb/> home, with which they seemed well
                    pleas'd,<lb/> and assured us of their hearty friendship<lb/> - but the next day
                    exhibited a very different<lb/> scene - the War dance­ Captain John<lb/> and
                    most of his party were drunk - they<lb/> were almost naked and frightfully
                    painted<lb/> which with their Yells, musick and Tomahocks<lb/> afforded an
                    entertainment, by no means<lb/> pleasing - before they came to the door of<lb/>
                    our Lodging, Captain John, who did<lb/>
                    <pb n="24" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_24"/> not join in the Dance, came forward, to
                    assure<lb/> us, that no injury was intended - We were obliged<lb/> to give them
                    a little Cyder and Tobacco. - It is a<lb/> regulation in this Garrison that no
                    Indian is<lb/> allowed to remain within the Picquet all night,<lb/>- on the 13th
                    Captain John, and his party, set<lb/> off to attend the great Council of
                    Indian<lb/> Tribes, to be held, previous to the Treaty, at the<lb/> Rapids of

                    of<lb/> the Southern Indians, are embodied at<lb/> another place, a considerable

                    short of<lb/> making the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> the boundary
                    line. - Our<lb/> Interpretter was formerly a Prisoner among the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>, and had been adopted into the
                    family<lb/> of this Young Man, in the place of his Father,<lb/> and in their
                    discourse the Indian gave him<lb/> that appellation, saying, <said

                        the truth - in<lb/> the begining of the World, this Land was given<lb/> to
                        the Indians, and the White People were placed<lb/> beyond the great water -
                        when the white Men<lb/> first came to this Land, the wise old Men<lb/> among
                        the Indians, told their People, that if<lb/> they received anything of the
                        white Men, they<lb/> would be destroyed,­ "the bitter Water was made<lb/>
                        for white folks, but the Water of the Brooks and<lb/> Rivers for, the
                        Indians</said>, - but not regarding<lb/> this advice, many of the Nations
                    Traded with<lb/> the Whites, took their Hatchets, Knives and<lb/> Rum, and gave
                    up their Land for trifles,<lb/> and, according to the ancient prediction,
                    they<lb/> have wasted away, and some of them -<lb/> become quite extinct, and
                    the few that<lb/> are remaining are driven, almost to<lb/>
                    <pb n="46" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_46"/> to where the sun sets, but they are

                    Sun sets, they would<lb/> all be lost forever. - The Congress must<lb/> remove
                    their Forts, and all their People over<lb/> the River, and then the Indians will
                    take<lb/> them by the hand, and become their true<lb/> friends - but should the
                    Commissioners<lb/> meet the Indians in Council, and there<lb/> pretend that they
                    have conquered their<lb/> Country, and will not remove out of it, in<lb/> that
                    case, the Indians will withdraw from<lb/> the Council, and then, instantly, fall
                    upon<lb/> the opposite party, and destroy them all -<lb/> this is the substance

                            may be settled without fighting and killing<lb/> one another, which we

                <p> Some of our Friends had an interview<lb/> with a Person of the Name of Wilbank,
                    who-<lb/> within a few days past arrived, with a Party<lb/> of 26 Southern
                    Indians, from the back parts of<lb/> the Carolina's and Georgia, at the Great
                    Council<lb/> at the Miami, - he came from thence to this<lb/> place, and a
                    Vessel is to be dispatched immediately<lb/> to carry him down to <persName
                        key="gsimc1">Governor Simcoe</persName>. He says,<lb/> that the Indians have
                    in several instances<lb/> been grossly imposed upon, particularly by<lb/>
                    <persName key="gblou1">Governor Blount</persName>, who by bribing an
                    Interpreter<lb/> had cheated them out of a great extent of<lb/> Country, and
                    defrauded them of one half<lb/> the Sum, agreed upon to be paid yearly, as<lb/>
                    as a compensation for the Land granted,-<lb/> in one instance where they had
                    agreed to<lb/> sell 50 miles square they had fraudulently<lb/> put in the Deed
                    80 miles - and where they had<lb/>
                    <pb n="60" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_60"/> had bargained for an extent of 10
                    miles<lb/> round the Town of Nashville, <persName key="gblou1">Governor
                        Blount</persName><lb/> had caused 40 miles to be inserted.- and instead<lb/>
                    of a Consideration of 2000 Dollars yearly, he had<lb/> put down but 1000
                    dollars.- This being but<lb/> one side of the question, we do not pretend
                    to<lb/> Judge, but it is the received opinion here, that<lb/> their errand to
                    the Council is, to form a Union<lb/> with the Northern Indians, and make
                    One<lb/> common cause, either in forming a Treaty,<lb/> or carrying on a War. -
                    The Vessell (the Felicity) to Carry<lb/> Wilbank to <placeName key="ferie">Fort
                        Erie</placeName>, sail'd about 2 oClock:-<lb/> - Yesterday a young Man going
                    out to look<lb/> for Horses, got lost in the Woods, which are very<lb/> thick
                    within less than a Mile of the Fort.-<lb/> several 18 pounders were fired in the
                    afternoon<lb/> in order to direct him in finding the way back,<lb/> which, I
                    suppose had the desired effect, as I am<lb/> informed he got safe home in the
                    Evening -<lb/>- several instances of the kind have before<lb/> occurred, and
                    sometimes the persons lost have<lb/> never returned. - It is said some little
                    time<lb/> past, two Indians were kill'd by the Wolves<lb/> in the Neighbourhood
                    of this place.</p>

                    <del>men</del><lb/> -mention was then made of the several<lb/> Treaties
                    concluded since the establishment<lb/> of the Independance of the United States,
                    and<lb/> of the new settlements made in consequence<lb/> of those treaties, and
                    of the impossibility of<lb/> removing such a great number of Families<lb/> from
                    their habitations and Farms; and<lb/> therefore, in the most explicit terms
                        <del>de-</del><lb/><del>clared</del> declared that the United States
                    could<lb/> not agree that the<geogName key="ohior"> River Ohio</geogName> should
                    be<lb/> the boundary line.- In the next place<lb/> the Commissioners
                    acknowledged that very<lb/> improper Language had been held out at<lb/> former
                    Treaties, when it had been said that<lb/> the United States claimed all the
                    Indian Coun<lb/>-try, (within certain limits mark'd out by<lb/> the Treaty of
                    Peace with the British) as a con-<lb/>quer'd Country.- The Commissioners<lb/>
                    <pb n="73" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_73"/> therefore, in the clearest terms, now
                    relin-<lb/>-quishd all such claim, reserving only the<lb/> preemption, or
                    exclusive right of purchasing<lb/> of the Indians.- The Commissioners then<lb/>
                    express'd their desires to meet the Indians in<lb/> full Council, and a belief
                    that if such <del><gap/></del><lb/><del><unclear>work</unclear></del> a thing
                    could be done, and a friendly<lb/> conference take place, a satisfactory and
                    lasting<lb/> Peace would be the consequence - They<lb/> concluded with
                    intimating that for the<lb/> sake of an accommodation they would be<lb/> willing
                    to give up all the Land to the N.W. of the<lb/>

                    generous compensation should be<lb/> paid down, and a yearly Rent allowed<lb/>
                    forever.- The answer was interpretted<lb/> paragraphically as it was read, and
                    then<lb/> the whole writing given to the Indians.</p>
                <p> -The old Wiandot Chief who delivered the<lb/> message yesterday, got up and

                    yesterday, and had only to say, that in<lb/> regard to the several Treaties
                    mentioned<lb/> yesterday, they did not acknowledge any of<lb/> them to be valid,
                    and as the Commissioners<lb/> had said they could not remove the white<lb/>

                    any of their<lb/> Country, and concluded with saying,<lb/> they came as Men
                    wishing for Peace,<lb/> but as that could not be obtained, they<lb/> should
                    return to their Council, and speak<lb/> to their warriors:- And as for the

                    them, they might go home, and tell <del>the</del><lb/><del>President</del>
