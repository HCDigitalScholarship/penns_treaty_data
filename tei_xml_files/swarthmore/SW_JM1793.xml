                <p>In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A
                    (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American Literature”) transcribed
                    a number of journals, both published and in manuscript form, which document the
                    interaction of Quakers and Native Americans. In 2014 a decision was made to
                    encode these and other journals as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library.</p>

                <p> The forepart of this day, we passed<lb/> a rapid stream, called the <geogName
                        key="loyalso">Loyalsock</geogName> — and in the af-<lb/>ternoon we crossed

                    seven times — lodged at <persName key="jkyle1">James Kyle</persName>'s.
                    Next<lb/> day rode forty-three miles without any entertain-<lb/>ment on the way,
                    except what we had with us. —<lb/> Where we put up, there was no hay to be had
                    for<lb/> our horses, so we fed them with oats, and tied them<lb/> up for the
                    night— went to bed, or rather lay on the<lb/> floor with our own blankets, in a
                    very small house;<lb/> but rested well. In the morning, the weather was<lb/>
                    fine and pleasant — rode to major <persName key="slind">Samuel
                        Lindley</persName>'s,<lb/> crossed the <geogName key="tioga"
                        >Tioga</geogName> twice, and the <geogName key="cowni">Cownisky</geogName>;
                    then to<lb/> the <placeName key="ppost">Painted Post</placeName>, crossing the
                        <geogName key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogName> at <persName key="dfull"
                        >David<lb/> Fuller</persName>'s. On our way here, we swam our horses<lb/>
                    over the <geogName key="tioga">Tioga</geogName>, and went ourselves in a canoe.
                    The<lb/> country from <placeName key="northu">Northumberland</placeName>to this
                    place, abounds<lb/> with large streams of water, and abundance of flat<lb/> land
                    on their banks, exceedingly rich. We observed<lb/> in many places, old Indian
                    fields, with signs of the <lb/>
                    <pb n="291" facs="SW_JM1793_003"/> old corn hills. On each side of these creeks and flats,<lb/> are
                    ridges of mountains. We have now travelled ac-<lb/>cording to the several
                    distances from place to place,<lb/> two hundred, and forty-seven miles. </p>

                <p> Rode about thirty miles, and a little be-<lb/>fore night, got to an old Indian
                    cabin, with fire in<lb/>the middle, where we lodged. We let our horses<lb/>
                    browse awhile in the woods, then fed them with oats<lb/> we had with us, and
                    tied them up for the night. —<lb/> This cabin stands on the bank of the
                        <geogName key="cohoc">Cohocton</geogName> . The<lb/> roads here are new, and
                    of course rough, which is<lb/> trying to the poor horses that are rid hard all
                    day,<lb/> and at night tied to a tree. Next day, rode thirty-<lb/> six miles to
                        <placeName key="willi">Williamsburgh</placeName>. Some parts of the
                    road<lb/> very rough. We passed over some of the steepest<lb/> hills I ever saw
                    travelled. But the country is new<lb/> — and I have no doubt in a few years, the
                    roads will<lb/> be much improved, as there is abundance of excel-<lb/>lent land
                    that is settling fast in some places. Stayed<lb/> this night at captain
                        <persName key="cwilm">Charles Williamson</persName>'s, where we<lb/> were

                <p> This morning the commissioners despatch-<lb/>ed a messenger to <placeName

                        <geogName key="genes2">Genesee river</geogName>. Here we found<lb/> about
                    fifty Indians collected, amongst whom were<lb/> some of their chiefs; <persName
                        key="farme1">Farmer's Brother</persName>, <persName key="redja1">Red

                    <persName key="litbi1">Little Billy</persName>, and others, to all of whom a
                    dinner<lb/> was given by the commissioners. They expressed<lb/> their gladness
                    in seeing us, and we also in seeing<lb/> them. In the evening we had some
                    weighty con-<lb/>versation together, wherein the commissioners im-<lb/>parted a
                    little of their business concerning the treaty; <lb/>
                    <pb n="292" facs="SW_JM1793_004"/> which appeared to give general satisfaction. After<lb/> which, the
                    Indians gave our friend <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> a<lb/>
                    new name, which they in their language call <foreign xml:lang="iro"

                    was<lb/> given by <persName key="farme1">Farmer's Brother</persName>, at which
                    there was a<lb/> small shout, in their way, and they would have given<lb/> us a
                    song on the occasion; but understanding we were<lb/> a plain people, not
                    accustomed to singing, it was<lb/> omitted, and nothing further followed than a
                    little<lb/> pleasantry. Near ten o'clock we all retired and <lb/> rested
                    bravely. </p>

                <p> In the morning the Indians showed no inclination<lb/> to depart while the
                    commissioners were here.<persName key="redja1">Red<lb/> Jacket</persName> , at
                    the close of one of his speeches last even-<lb/>ing, signified, that when he was
                    in Philadelphia, the<lb/> white people had proposed a method for them to<lb/>
                    turn buffaloes into cows, deer into sheep, and bears<lb/> into hogs; he thought
                    it now a fit time for the com-<lb/>missioners to show them a piece of their
                    skill; as<lb/> they were now on their way to <placeName key="canan"
                        >Canandaigua</placeName> for<lb/> some clothing, &amp;c, and that a good
                    buffalo would be<lb/> very agreeable for provision on the way. The
                    com-<lb/>missioners used some endeavours to obtain a fat cow;<lb/> but as there
                    was none to be had here, they gave them<lb/> a quantity of salt beef, pork, and
                    corn, at which they<lb/> appeared satisfied. </p>

                <p> We prepared to move forward; divers other<lb/> people fell in company with us
                    from <placeName key="schen">Schenectady</placeName>
                    <lb/>and other places, who were going into <placeName key="canad">Upper
                        Cana-<lb/>da</placeName>. We swam our horses over the <geogName key="genes2"
                        >Genesee river</geogName><lb/> with some difficulty, and we, with our
                    baggage,<lb/> crossed in a canoe. In the evening we put up in the<lb/> woods by
                    the side of <geogName key="tonnec">Tonnewanta creek</geogName>, where we<lb/>
                    sheltered for the night with a good fire, and tied up <lb/>
                    <pb n="293" facs="SW_JM1793_005"/> our horses as before. The following day we travel-<lb/>led hard,
                    being very desirous to reach some house<lb/> to lodge in. According to the
                    account given us, we<lb/> rode about fifty miles, and truly we thought them<lb/>
                    long enough. Arrived at <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogName> about
                    sun<lb/> set, and put up at <persName key="winney">landlord Winney</persName>'s;
                    most of us<lb/> lodged on the floor and slept well; also, had plenty<lb/> of
                    grass for the horses. The country we have pass-<lb/>ed through the last two
                    days, is Indian lands, and<lb/> one continued wilderness. Much of the land
                    ap-<lb/>pears very good, with a variety of timber, such as<lb/> oak, hickory,
                    sugar maple, elm, ash, beech, linn,<lb/> pine, cherry, butternut, &amp;c. </p>

                    <placeName key="brit">British dominions</placeName>, and rode down the banks of

                        <geogName key="niagf">great falls</geogName>. The<lb/> whole distance to
                    this place is four hundred and<lb/> twenty-seven miles. In the evening, walked
                    to<lb/> the brow of the bank to view the mighty cataract.<lb/> Next morning went
                    again, descended a very steep<lb/> hill and walked to the rock over which the
                    water<lb/>falls, which appears tremendous indeed. There are<lb/> rapids above
                    the cataract that fall, it is said, fifty feet<lb/> (and it looks likely to be
                    so) within the distance of<lb/> little more than half a mile. After satisfying

                    a favoured opportunity. After dinner we<lb/> had a solid opportunity with the
                    family and divers<lb/> friends who had stayed with us. Then went about six<lb/>
                    miles to our friend <persName key="jhill1">John Hill's</persName>, who, with his

                <p> I felt much better in health, and understand-<lb/>ing divers Friends live at a
                    place called the <geogName key="short">Short<lb/> Hills</geogName>, about twelve
                    miles off, we concluded to go<lb/> there. On the way we dined at <persName

                        <persName key="jgilh1">Joshua Gillam</persName>'s. We passed<lb/> through
                    some land where we saw the effects of a<lb/> hurricane that was on the 1st of
                    the 7th month last,<lb/> and truly I may say, I never saw so great
                    destruc-<lb/>tion of timber. For about two miles in width, and<lb/> said to be
                    many miles in length, there was scarce a<lb/> single tree left that was not torn
                    up by the roots, or<lb/> broken off. This tract, as far as we have passed
                    over,<lb/> appears excellent land, with a variety of good tim-<lb/>ber — white
                    and black oak, hickory, chestnut, poplar,<lb/> white pine, walnut, cherry,
                    &amp;c. We, finding a few<lb/> Friends settled in this neighborhood, concluded
                    to<lb/> stay amongst them over first-day, and have a meet-<lb/>ing with them. In

                <p> The weather wet and little business<lb/> to be done — though the article
                    provision meets with<lb/> a large consumption — we being all in pretty good<lb/>
                    health, and for the most part a number of Indians and<lb/> others at our camp.
                    The commissioners are most of<lb/> the time at <placeName key="nav">Navy

                    crossed the river and went to <lb/><pb n="298" facs="SW_JM1793_010"/> an Indian settlement of about

                <p> and first of the week, we held a meeting about <lb/>four miles from the landing,
                    in a large barn, of which<lb/> previous notice had been given. The collection
                    was<lb/> large, and proved a solid opportunity. I hope it<lb/> tended to the
                    advancement of our religious testimo-<lb/>ny. Divers Friends came many miles to
                    attend it.<lb/> After which, <persName key="wsave1">William Savery

                        >Benjamin</persName> went with us six miles<lb/> to the Fort. Here are the

                    then<lb/> lying here. We went on board the Dunmore, <persName key="cford1"
                        >cap-<lb/>tain Ford</persName>, bound to <placeName key="detro"

                    steered<lb/> up the lake. We had fine pleasant weather until the<lb/> 8th, when
                    being near the islands towards the head <lb/>of the lake, and dark night coming
                    on us, we stood<lb/> off and on till morning — had several squalls of rain,<lb/>
                    and short blasts of high wind, with thunder and<lb/> lightning — which was
                    somewhat alarming, as our<lb/> ship had on board a large quantity of powder.
                    But<lb/> through the goodness of kind Providence we were<lb/> preserved from

                <p> and first of the week; — fine pleasant morning<lb/> with light airs of wind. The
                    islands now appeared<lb/> in sight. This day we had a small meeting in the<lb/>
                    cabin with our fellow passengers and two Indian<lb/> chiefs. In the evening
                    entered the mouth of <geogName key="detro"> Detriot<lb/> river</geogName>, and
                    anchored till morning; when we ran up<lb/> the beautiful river a northerly
                    course, with a fair<lb/> wind to <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>.
                    This is a small garrison town, with<lb/> a variety of inhabitants. Here is much
                    of the sound<lb/> of drums and trumpets, but not much religion. The<lb/> people
                    here, as well as those on board our ship, were<lb/> very respectful to us — and
                    there was great harmony<lb/> amongst ourselves. Thanks be to kind
                    Providence<lb/> for all his unmerited favours. Here we landed our<lb/> small
                    baggage, and took lodgings at <persName key="mdols">Matthew

                <p> Took a walk down the bank of the river,<lb/> about three miles to a fine spring,

                    for many miles above and<lb/> below the town, are very thickly settled,
                    mostly<lb/> with French, who have fine orchards and meadows,<lb/> and good wheat
                    growing. Their grain is mostly<lb/> manufactured by wind-mills, of which there
                    are<lb/> many in sight. The inhabitants of the town are as<lb/> great a mixture,
                    I think, as I ever knew in any one<lb/> place. English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch,
                    French, Ame-<lb/>ricans from different states, with black and yellow,<lb/> and
                    seldom clear of Indians of different tribes in the<lb/> day time. These are all
                    turned out by nine o'clock<lb/> at night, and the gates are shut — sentries are
                    placed<lb/> constantly in various parts round tire town, which is <lb/>enclosed
                    with high pickets. There is no place of wor-<lb/>ship except one <orgName

                    all<lb/> well. We have frequently been visited by num-<lb/>bers of the Indian

                    they use to describe the Ame-<lb/>ricans of the United States; but when informed

                    were glad. This day, we were visited<lb/> by several that had just come to town.
                    We observ-<lb/>ed the generality of all the tribes had a remarkable<lb/> thirst

                <p> First of the week, we held a meeting in a<lb/> large sail loft in the shipyard;
                    had a considerable<lb/> gathering of the town's people, and a few soldiers,<lb/>

                <p> The Indians are every day here, on their<lb/> way to the treaty. Twenty-eight
                    are just arrived<lb/> from <placeName key="michi">Michillimackinac</placeName>,
                    some of whom I saw this<lb/> morning; they were well dressed, curiously
                    painted,<lb/> and decorated with wampum, and ear and nose bobs;<lb/> all young,
                    and the handsomest I think I have as<lb/> yet seen. They appeared good humoured
                    and plea-<lb/>sant, <lb/>
                    <pb n="305" facs="SW_JM1793_017"/> having, as I was informed, brought no arms or<lb/> warlike
                    instruments with them, except their bows<lb/> and arrows, with flutes for music,
                    of their own<lb/> making, which appeared simple, but pleasing to<lb/>
                    themselves. Some of the British officers asked<lb/> them to play, which they
                    readily did, by putting<lb/> the instrument to the mouth, and sometimes to
                    the<lb/> nose; as handily to the one as the other.</p>

                <p> This evening had the company of <persName key="cdrak1">capt. John
                        Drake</persName>,<lb/> a coaster between this and <placeName key="macki"
                        >Mackinaw</placeName>, distant one<lb/> hundred and thirty leagues — sails
                    in a sloop of se-<lb/>venty or eighty tons burthen. He gave us some<lb/> account
                    of the north-west fur trade, and the man-<lb/>ner of its being carried on by the
                    companies con-<lb/>cerned, who employ many hundred men, that stay<lb/> many
                    years in the country, travelling and trading<lb/> with the northern Indians for
                    peltry; an abundance<lb/> of which, of the richest kind, is brought from
                    the<lb/> high northern latitudes, which nets the companies<lb/> very large
                    profit. But among what people, or in<lb/> what part of the world, except the
                        <orgName key="lowcan">Canadian French</orgName>,<lb/> could persons be found
                    for their purpose, I know<lb/> not. They are allowed a very small portion
                    of<lb/> provisions from this to the <placeName key="grandp">Grand
                        Portage</placeName>, at the<lb/> head of <geogName key="lakes">Lake
                        Superior</geogName>, which is about eight hun-<lb/>dred miles; there they
                    are allowed about one bushel<lb/> (forty-two quarts French measure) of Indian
                    corn<lb/> per man, for a year, and a little fat, which they<lb/> may use at
                    their own discretion. The corn is pre-<lb/>pared in a curious manner at
                        <placeName key="detro"> Detroit</placeName>, being first<lb/> boiled in
                    strong lye, which takes off the outside<lb/> hull; afterwards it is spread out
                    and dried, then<lb/> packed up for use. With this they set out, and re-<lb/>
                    turn not until the end of the year, when a fresh <lb/>
                    <pb n="306" facs="SW_JM1793_018"/> supply of goods is taken up with canoes, &amp;c. by<lb/> many
                    hundred men to the <placeName key="grandp">Portage</placeName>, where they
                    ex-<lb/>change commodities to a very great amount. Thus<lb/> goes on the trade
                    from year to year. The men in<lb/> the north live principally on fish, and the
                    flesh of<lb/> beasts of divers kinds, without bread or salt, and<lb/> when they
                    return appear as robust and healthy, and<lb/> even more so than those who live
                    on the greatest<lb/> delicacies. The principal fish in <geogName key="lakes"
                        >Lake Superior</geogName> are<lb/> the white fish and salmon trout, which
                    are fine<lb/> and delicate: we have eat of them, brought fresh from<lb/> the
                    lake to this place in six days. </p>
                <p> We understand one <persName key="mkenz1">M'Kenzie</persName> is now out
                    with<lb/> ten men, exploring the <placeName key="northw"> North-west
                        Territory</placeName> : he<lb/> once attempted it before; was out more than
                    a year,<lb/> and discovered large frozen waters in the north, but,<lb/> whether
                    lakes or ocean, he knew not — supposed the<lb/> latter, the water being salt. </p>

                <p>
                    <persName key="cdrak1">Captain Drake</persName>, by his own account, had been
                    se-<lb/>veral voyages to <placeName key="afri">Africa</placeName>, in the horrid
                    business of <lb/>fetching slaves, which he now very much condemns.<lb/> He told
                    us many curious tales; — and is certainly<lb/> a very temperate man with respect
                    to drink, taking<lb/> nothing but water — a rare instance in a seafaring<lb/>
                    man. Happy would it be for many thousands in<lb/> the world, were his example
                    followed in that re-<lb/>spect; families would be preserved from ruin and<lb/>
                    distress, morality increase, the poor Indians be<lb/> saved from many acts of
                    violence, and the end of<lb/> our creation be more fully answered by
                    honouring<lb/> God, our Creator. </p>

                <p> We are frequently visited by the officers of<lb/> this place, both civil and
                    military, who appear<lb/> friendly, and treat us with much respect, often <lb/>
                    <pb n="307" facs="SW_JM1793_019"/> wishing us success in our laudable undertaking; as-<lb/>suring us,
                    that nothing should be wanting that lay<lb/> in their power, to render us happy
                    and comfortable.<lb/> The commandant said, that if he apprehended dan-<lb/>ger
                    at any time, he should lay his commands on us<lb/> not to depart the place. But,
                    although we sought<lb/> not the protection of military power, we were not<lb/>
                    insensible of his great good will towards us, which<lb/> we were not wanting to

                <p> Visits from the Indians are almost every day re-<lb/>peated, by different tribes
                    constantly coming in,<lb/>, this being the thoroughfare for all the northern
                    In-<lb/>dians. It would be difficult to describe the various<lb/> appearances
                    they make, and languages they speak.<lb/> It is wonderful to find the vast
                    expense the <orgName key="brit">British<lb/> government</orgName> is at with
                    this people. <persName key="gsim1">Governor Sim-<lb/>coe</persName> said it cost

                <p> This day had a visit from a <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> chief,<lb/>
                    who appeared to have much concern respecting the<lb/> approaching treaty, and
                    mentioned the remem-<lb/>brance of some long and broad belts that were
                    given<lb/> out in former treaties, intended to bind us by the<lb/> hands and
                    arms, so that no small accident in future<lb/> should be able to make a
                    separation; and, notwith-<lb/>standing all that had happened, they (<orgName
                        key="wyandot">the Wyan-<lb/>dots</orgName>) felt some of the old affection
                    to remain, and he<lb/> hoped we would find it so at the general council;<lb/>
                    but could speak for none but themselves. We as-<lb/>sured him we had the same
                    love and friendship for<lb/> them and all others, as our forefathers had, and
                    that<lb/> our principles had always restrained us from war;<lb/> and when we
                    believed the government was disposed <lb/>
                    <pb n="308" facs="SW_JM1793_020"/> to make peace with them on principles of justice,<lb/> we were
                    made willing to leave our homes and take<lb/> this long journey to endeavour to
                    promote it, and<lb/> to be present at the concluding of so good a work.<lb/> He
                    said, he knew long ago, we did not fight, but<lb/> were for peace, and that, as
                    we had come a long<lb/> journey, preserved in health, it was evident the<lb/>
                    Great Spirit was pleased with our coming, and he<lb/> hoped some good would be
                    done, and that the<lb/> Great Spirit would bring us home in health and<lb/>
                    safety. </p>

                <p> We had a visit also this morning from <persName key="Ab">Abram</persName>,
                    an<lb/> Indian chief, <persName key="katha">Katharine</persName> his wife, and
                    their daugh-<lb/>ters, richly clad, with plates of silver, &amp;c. </p>

                <p> The introduction of distilled spirits among the<lb/> people appears to have been
                    their ruin. The frauds,<lb/> in consequence of it, imposed upon them, taking
                    in<lb/> the ravages and depredations of war made amongst<lb/> themselves, with
                    multiplied murders and thefts,<lb/> seems to have prevented their being a
                    wealthy peo-<lb/>ple. The contrary with many is sorrowfully their <lb/>
                    situation, I fear to our condemnation; yet the his-<lb/>tory of Indian
                    barbarity, and breach of faith to<lb/> white people, and to one another, which
                    we have<lb/> heard related since we came here, would be shock-<lb/>ing to
                    recite, and is almost at times ready to stagger<lb/> the faith of their best
                    friends. One of the <orgName key="moravian">Moravian<lb/> missionaries</orgName>
                    signified his sense, that if peace should<lb/> be concluded, it would not last
                    long, until they were<lb/> further chastised. <persName key="jparr1">John
                        Parrish</persName> asked, by what<lb/> means? Did he mean the sword? He was
                    answered,<lb/> yes. This sentiment, from one of those who make<lb/> profession
                    of the peaceable principles of the gospel,<lb/> was really discouraging. </p>


                <pb n="309" facs="SW_JM1793_021"/>
                <p> We often hear many frightful things suggested; as,<lb/> that we shall be either
                    killed, or kept as hostages at<lb/> the ensuing council. This, with the accounts
                    of the<lb/> Indian warriors in time past, frequently passing with<lb/> numbers
                    of scalps and their disconsolate prisoners,<lb/> seemed dreadful; yet we are not
                    discouraged from<lb/> pursuing our first prospect; believing he that put us<lb/>
                    forth, will go before us, if we are not wanting on our<lb/> part. </p>

                <p> It must be said to the honour of British humani-<lb/>ty, and in commendation of
                    this government of Up-<lb/>per <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>, and

                    one of their chiefs, who had given his interest in<lb/> favour of the Americans,
                    in such a manner as to cre-<lb/>ate jealousies amongst them. They,

                <p> I was this day very poorly with a fever.—<lb/> We were visited by fourteen of

                <p> We are much confined within the narrow<lb/> limits of this small garrisoned
                    town, where, the<lb/> streets being narrow, there is a want of air. A
                    fa-<lb/>vourable opportunity presenting for a small tour on<lb/> the water, we,
                    except <persName key="wsave1">William Savery</persName> and <persName
                        key="whart">William<lb/> Hartshorne</persName>, went in a boat, provided by
                    our friend<lb/>
                    <persName key="wbak1">William Baker</persName>, up the river about nine miles, to<lb/>
                    <persName key="nwill1">Nathan Williams</persName>'s, where we were kindly
                    received,<lb/> and dined. His place is situate at the entrance of<lb/><geogName
                        key="lakst"> Lake St. Clair</geogName>. While here, Nathan gave us an
                    ac-<lb/>count, that in digging a cave for a root house, they<lb/> found, about
                    six feet below the surface of the<lb/> ground, large quantities of human bones,
                    that must<lb/> have been for a long time there: and at another<lb/> place on the
                    bank of the lake, it being washed away<lb/> when the lake was high, there were
                    seen great<lb/> numbers of the same kind, which they gathered up<lb/> and
                    buried. The Indians said they must have been <lb/>
                    <pb n="312" facs="SW_JM1793_024"/> from people a great while ago that they knew no-<lb/>thing of.
                    There is also near this lake, as we are in-<lb/>formed, the appearance of old
                    forts, curiously made<lb/> in ancient time, where pieces of earthenware are<lb/>
                    often found, though large trees are now standing in<lb/> the entrenchments, of
                    which the present Indians<lb/> can give no account. We seem pretty generally
                    led<lb/> to believe, from various circumstances, that the na-<lb/>tives of this
                    land must be the descendants of old<lb/> Jacob, and are of the scattered tribes,
                    who probably<lb/> found their way here through <placeName key="rus"
                        >Russia</placeName>, and crossed<lb/> over the narrow strait from <placeName
                        key="kams">Kamschatka</placeName> to the west<lb/> side of America. Be all
                    this as it may, we find them<lb/> here in great numbers, at present a savage,
                    barbarous<lb/> people when at war, and more particularly when in-<lb/>toxicated
                    with strong drink, which has been intro-<lb/>duced by the white people that
                    suppose themselves<lb/> by far their superiors in religious and natural
                    under-<lb/>standing. Happy would it have been for them and<lb/> us, had we used
                    those superior talents, in mercy<lb/> conferred upon us, more to the honour of
                    God, by<lb/> following the example of our holy leader, Christ<lb/> Jesus, who
                    said he <quote type="biblical">came not to destroy men's lives,<lb/> but to save

                    hea-<lb/>ven in all our conduct, consistent with the design of<lb/> our
                    creation. Then might we have reason to hope<lb/> for a blessing on our labours,
                    tending to stop the<lb/> effusion of human blood, and the establishment of<lb/>
                    Christ's kingdom on the mountain of love and holi-<lb/>ness, where the lion and
                    the lamb might lie down<lb/> together, there being nothing to make us
                    afraid.<lb/> In the afternoon we re-embarked and returned to <lb/>

                    them what had frequently been sug-<lb/>gested to us before, by divers persons,
                    that if the<lb/> commissioners did not immediately agree that all<lb/> the land
                    west of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> should be given up by the<lb/>
                    <placeName key="usa">United States</placeName>, or even hinted any thing to the
                    con-<lb/>trary, by offering gifts or money as purchase, that<lb/> not one of
                    them or their company would go off the<lb/> ground alive; for their fathers, who
                    were all gone,<lb/> had sold lands for knives, rum, &amp;c. till they were<lb/>
                    now driven almost to the sun setting, where they<lb/> were determined to make a
                    stand. He also pointed<lb/> out very sensibly, the sad effects strong drink
                    had<lb/> on their fathers in general. He then appeared per-<lb/>fectly sober —
                    informing that four days before he left<lb/> the <geogName key="miamr1">Miami
                        Rapids</geogName>, a deputation of two chiefs from<lb/> a tribe, embarked
                    for <placeName key="niagf">Niagara</placeName> to meet the commis-<lb/>sioners,
                    and let them know the outlines of their con-<lb/>clusions; and that if the white
                    people would settle<lb/> to the banks of the <geogName key="ohior"
                        >Ohio</geogName> on the east side, and agree<lb/> that the river should be
                    the line, they would be glad,<lb/> and take them by the hand and call them
                    brothers.<lb/> But we apprehended no such power lay with the<lb/> commissioners,
                    nor of its being the design of govern-<lb/>ment, — the cloud looked dark and
                    heavy, and por-<lb/>tended some dreadful scenes of desolation, except<lb/> the
                    Lord should be pleased, in his abundant mercy,<lb/> to interpose and spare this
                    wicked generation. </p>

                <p> The aforesaid Indian, notwithstanding his sensi-<lb/>bility and calmness, about
                    two hours after, returned<lb/> much intoxicated with rum — behaved very
                    rudely,<lb/> and drew a stroke with his tomahawk at one <persName key="sash1"
                        >Sylves-<lb/>ter Ash</persName>, an interpreter, who had long resided with <lb/>
                    <pb n="314" facs="SW_JM1793_026"/> the <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>, and now lives at
                        <placeName key="fpitt1">Fort Pitt</placeName>. We sup-<lb/>posed he had a
                    grudge against him for leaving them;<lb/> but <persName key="sash1"
                        >Ash</persName> prevented his doing him mischief. This,<lb/> with other
                    insolent behavior to our landlord, caused<lb/>
                    <persName key="cmuns1">captain Munsey</persName>, who was there, to send for
                    some<lb/> soldiers to turn him out of the garrison. These<lb/> things look
                    gloomy, and tend to confirm us that no-<lb/>thing short of wisdom from above
                    will do for us to<lb/> lean to. </p>

                        <persName key="haupa1">Hendrick</persName>s' account is more favourable<lb/>
                    than some others we have had. He expresses a<lb/> hope there will be a peace.
                    The general cry among<lb/> the gentlemen and more knowing inhabitants of
                    this<lb/> place is, <said who="undetermined">for God's sake, gentlemen, don't
                        venture<lb/> yourselves to <placeName key="sandu"

                    friendship and good will to us,<lb/> and makes it at times very trying. And
                    though we<lb/> have not felt any slavish fears — yet hope to move<lb/>
                    cautiously, as wisdom, which is profitable to direct,<lb/> may point out the
                    way. One of the Indians, a <orgName key="delaware">De-<lb/>laware</orgName>,
                    that brought <persName key="haupa1">captain Hendricks'</persName> letter,

                    the motion of <persName key="gwayn1">general Wayne's</persName> army,<lb/> from
                    whom they have some fearful apprehensions;<lb/> which we hope are

                    a visit from<lb/> several others of the same tribe. One of a solid<lb/>
                    countenance said, he heartily desired we might<lb/> succeed in the great work of

                <p> First of the week. For some days I have<lb/> felt rather dull and heavy — my
                    spirits low. I feel<lb/> the importance of our embassy with much weight. —<lb/>
                    The dark conversation frequently heard respecting<lb/> war, is truly distressing
                    and discouraging. I am <lb/>frequently led to recur back to the first
                    principles<lb/> from whence the concern took its rise; and have, as<lb/> yet, no
                    cause to doubt of its propriety, although<lb/> many discouraging prospects are
                    frequently thrown<lb/> in our way. We are comfortably preserved in unity<lb/>
                    one with another in the main cause we are engaged<lb/> in, hoping we shall not
                    be shaken from the right<lb/> ground by the enemies of peace, — of which
                    there<lb/> are many. </p>

                <p> This day we had another meeting in the usual<lb/> place, which was large and
                    solid. </p>

                <p> Had an interview with <persName key="celli1">captain Elliot</persName>, who<lb/>
                    had just returned from the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, where the
                    Indians<lb/> are collected; but nothing further has transpired.<lb/> He appears
                    somewhat reserved; and our anxious<lb/> state of suspense still continues. We
                    are apprehen-<lb/>
                    <pb n="318" facs="SW_JM1793_030"/> sive the Indian embassy to the commissioners may<lb/> prevent the
                    proposed treaty. We wrote a letter to <lb/><persName key="amcke1">colonel

                    first opportunity. </p>

                <p> Here we observe a species of Indian slaves called<lb/>
                    <orgName key="pawnee">Pawnees</orgName>, or Punins, — who are captives taken

                    nations.<lb/> It is sorrowful to think that a nation so famed for<lb/> liberty,
                    should hold them, and a number of the Afri-<lb/>can race, in a state of bondage
                    during life. The go-<lb/>vernment here, we understand, has made some essay<lb/>
                    towards their enlargement, which, it is hoped, will,<lb/> in time, amount to a

                    to visit the In-<lb/>dians in their present council at the <geogName
                        key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName>, where<lb/> he was now about to return. He
                    told us, he thought<lb/> in the present state of things, it would not be
                    eligi-<lb/>ble to move that way. He gave us to understand,<lb/> that the Indians
                    were generally acquainted with our<lb/> being here, and our views towards them;
                    and hoped<lb/> on the return of the Indian embassy, some way would<lb/> open for
                    our relief. For the present, we concluded<lb/> to forward the letters to and the
                    <persName key="amcke1">M'Kee</persName> Indians, by<lb/>
                    <persName key="celli1">Elliot</persName>, and as our having a personal interview
                    with<lb/> the Indians appeared doubtful, we forwarded Friends'<lb/> Address to
                    them, to be read by <persName key="amcke1">M'Kee</persName> in case we<lb/>
                    should fail of an opportunity ourselves. </p>

                <p> First of the week. We held a meeting in<lb/> the sail loft at the tenth hour,
                    which was a favour-<lb/>ed time, it being large and solid. Soon after our
                    re-<lb/>turn, we heard of the arrival of the Dunmore at the<lb/> mouth of the
                    river, by a passenger who came in her,<lb/> and that the commissioners are on

                    now it looks likely to be a parting one, — the peo-<lb/>ple behaved with
                    remarkable quietness — manifest-<lb/>ing much respect to us. I believe there are
                    a few<lb/> tender-hearted ones in this place that will remember<lb/> us, and I
                    hope we shall not forget them; — though it<lb/> is sorrowful to behold the power

                    foundation,<lb/> and a humble confidence in the Divine power, which<lb/>I trust
                    we felt in our embarkation. </p>

                <p> I went on board the schooner, and near<lb/> night landed at our camp, where I
                    was informed a<lb/> deputation of Indians from the <geogName key="miamr1"
                        >Rapids</geogName> had been here,<lb/> and held a conference with the

                        key="niaga">Niagara</placeName>,<lb/> asserting that nothing short of
                        <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName> being the<lb/> line, would
                    satisfy them; they requested the com-<lb/>missioners’ <pb n="324" facs="SW_JM1793_036"/> answer
                    to-morrow, on that head, and re-<lb/>tired over the river. This unexpected
                    change look-<lb/>ed again discouraging; believing our worthy com-<lb/>missioners
                    had nothing but upright views in their<lb/> proceedings, consistent with the
                    trust reposed in them<lb/> by the government of the United States. Though<lb/>

                <p> In the afternoon the Indians came over, and<lb/> being seated on the beautiful

                        >Genesee</placeName>, in the Seneca lan-<lb/>guage. In it was contained many

                    demands as they seemed to wish, they declined to<lb/> make any reply at present.
                    But having the paper<lb/> given to them, said they would consider it
                    mature-<lb/>ly, and return an answer tomorrow. On which the<lb/> council broke

                    <geogName key="whiti">Whitewood Island</geogName>, opposite to our camp.

                    <persName key="sgirt1">Simon<lb/> Girty</persName> was their interpreter. After

                    colder<lb/> — wind N. W. which caused an increase of muske-<lb/>toes in our
                    tents. </p>

                    was glad he was noticed in his<lb/> last moments. I think I never saw before so
                    hasty<lb/> a burial. His coffin was made immediately, and his<lb/> interment
                    took place about sunset, in a grave near-<lb/>by on the bank of the river,
                    attended by about twen-<lb/>ty people, whites, blacks, and Indians. This

                <p> In the afternoon came two young Indian<lb/> men, (<orgName key="wyandot"
                        >Wyandots</orgName>) they looked wild and afraid; one<lb/> of them was

                    him a message in writing, from the great<lb/> council, informing, that the
                    several treaties at <placeName key="fmint">Fort<lb/> M'Intosh</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="miam">Miami</placeName>, <placeName key="musk"
                        >Muskingum</placeName>, &amp;c, where lands<lb/> had been ceded by two or
                    three nations only, were<lb/> not valid, as they had no right to cede lands.
                    And<lb/> as for the large sums of money proposed to be given<lb/> for their
                    country, they did not want it, and a great<lb/> many of them did not know the
                    use of it: therefore<lb/> desired it might be applied with the proposed
                    sala-<lb/>ry, to the indemnification of the settlers north of<lb/> the
                        <placeName key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>. And as they supposed they were
                    mostly<lb/> poor people, or they would not have settled on dis-<lb/>puted lands,
                    they now proposed that government <lb/> should give the money to them. It would
                    be a suf-<lb/>ficient compensation to those settlers, and might in-<lb/>duce
                    them to move quietly somewhere else, out of<lb/> the Indian country — and make
                    the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> the bounda-<lb/>ry: for it was their
                    land. And signified, as the<lb/> land to the westward was filled up, they had
                    no-<lb/>where to repair to, and were now determined to lay <lb/><pb n="330" facs="SW_JM1793_042"/>
                    their bones in that country. As to the concessions<lb/> the commissioners
                    proposed making, by giving mo-<lb/>ney, they did not want it; and running a new
                    line<lb/> was but giving them a part of their own land. And<lb/> as to
                    disclaiming the right to all their country by<lb/> virtue of the peace made with
                    the king, their father,<lb/> they knew they never were conquered, and the
                    pre-<lb/>emption right agreed on by the British and United<lb/> States,
                    concerning the purchasing of their country,<lb/> could not be binding on them;
                    for they supposed<lb/> they had a right to sell their lands to whom they<lb/>
                    pleased. Upon the whole, it was received as a very<lb/> contemptible speech, by
                    our commissioners — which<lb/> soon appeared to be the case, as the baggage
                    was<lb/> ordered on board, and caused an alarm in our camp. </p>
                <p> Some for safety proposed to lodge on board the ship,<lb/> and divers tents were
                    struck. Some went on board,<lb/> and others took to the house for safety. This
                    pros-<lb/>pect, all on a sudden, looked gloomy, and Friends<lb/> got together to
                    feel if any thing further opened for<lb/> us to do. We felt much shut up; — and
                    as we had <lb/> never been called into council with the commission-<lb/>ers, nor
                    had any public conference with the Indians,<lb/> we were obliged to bear our own
                    burthens, and sub-<lb/>mit the awful subject to the interposition of the
                    Di-<lb/>vine hand, and turn our faces homeward to our dear<lb/> friends and
                    connections, in hopes of reaching our<lb/> Yearly Meeting. </p>

                <p> This evening, two runners who were despatched<lb/> three days ago, returned with
                    a verbal message from<lb/> the <orgName key="sxntns">Five Nations</orgName>, who
                    expected us to come for-<lb/>ward, and were moving six miles down the river
                    to<lb/> meet us. They having all along appeared very<lb/> friendly to the
                        <orgName key="usag">United States</orgName>, this appeared an art-<lb/><pb
                        n="331" facs="SW_JM1793_043"/> ful manoeuvre, on one side or the other. It was<lb/> somewhat
                    extraordinary to hear <persName key="glinc1">general Lincoln</persName>
                    ex-<lb/>press, that they had received just such an answer as<lb/> he could have
                    wished. What his meaning was, is<lb/> unknown. Friends slept in their tents as
                    heretofore,<lb/> I believe with little fear. </p>

                    ele-<lb/>ven o'clock, we were all on board, and stood down<lb/> the river into
                    the lake. My mind felt sorrowful and<lb/> very heavy, reflecting on the
                    important subject of<lb/> our journey; but I could see nothing material
                    omit-<lb/>ted on our part, to give uneasiness: so I endeavoured<lb/> to rest

                    building — there are also<lb/> raccoons and many other wild animals on them.
                    We<lb/> stood out into the open lake with pleasant weather.<lb/> Had a season of

                    side<lb/> of the house, in the whole, twenty-four. I dined at<lb/>
                    <persName key="twist1">Thomas Wistar</persName>'s, and towards evening returned
                    to <lb/>

                    <placeName key="germa">Germantown</placeName>, feeling myself very poorly with
                    great<lb/> debility. While in the city, I had occasion to pass<lb/> by Friends'
                    burial ground, the <geogName key="pfiel">Potter's field</geogName>-, and<lb/>
                    several others. The prospect was awful and alarm-<lb/>ing, to behold the many
                    new graves, and others dig-<lb/>ging, with the hearses standing, and some
                    coming<lb/> and going — most of which were attended by the<lb/> black people,
                    whom it is said the disorder has not <lb/>reached. This is a token of mercy,
                    mixed with<lb/> judgment, both to them and the whites, they being<lb/> the
                    principal nurses and carriers of the dead. I am<lb/> hardly able to describe my
                    feelings on the present<lb/> occasion, believing it to be all in wisdom, and
                    hoping<lb/> it may have a tendency to bring the lofty from their<lb/> seats, and
                    beget greater humility than has of latter<lb/> time appeared in that highly
                    favoured city. </p>

                <p> First of the week. The weather much the<lb/> same as many days past. I felt very
                    weak and poor-<lb/>ly; did not go out to meeting, but kept in my quar-<lb/>ters,
                    where I was very kindly and tenderly treated,<lb/> wanting for nothing the house
                    could afford to make<lb/> me comfortable. <persName key="jjohn5">John
                        Johnson</persName> and his wife <persName key="rjohn2"/>Rachel,<lb/> appear
                    to be tender-hearted, sympathizing friends,<lb/> blessed with a plenty of the
                    good things of this life,<lb/> and an open disposition to communicate freely
                    to<lb/> those that are in need. May the Lord reward them,<lb/> as good stewards
                    of the manifold favours received. </p>

                <p> This day our general <orgName key="pym">Yearly Meeting</orgName> be-<lb/>gins,
                    at ten o'clock in the morning. I much desired<lb/> to be there; but remaining
                    poorly, concluded to lay<lb/> by another day for rest. I think I now feel the
                    ef-<lb/>fects of hard riding through the wilderness, and ly-<lb/>ing on the damp
                    ground; being stiffened, with sore-<lb/>ness in my bones. <persName key="jelli1"
                        >John Elliott</persName>, I hear, has been <lb/>
                    <pb n="343" facs="SW_JM1793_055"/> poorly since his arrival in town. Neither he nor<lb/>
                    <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName> was at meeting on seventh-day.
                        <persName key="jlind1">Jacob<lb/> Lindley</persName>, <persName key="wsave1"
                        >William Savery</persName> and myself were there,<lb/> and glad to see each
                    other again in that place; and<lb/> many friends expressed their gladness at our
                    safe<lb/> return. </p>

                <p> The weather dry and warm, the roads very<lb/> dusty. This morning felt better.
                    Leaving my horse<lb/> here, I rode into town with my friend <persName
                        key="jjohn5">John John-<lb/>son</persName>, in a chair -- attended two
                    sittings of our Yearly<lb/> Meeting, which was much smaller than usual. Our<lb/>
                    friend <persName key="nwai1">Nicholas Wain</persName>, was again chosen clerk
                    for<lb/> the present year; and the business went on in much <lb/>brotherly love
                    and concord — a good degree of so-<lb/>lemnity and weight attending. I lodged at
                        <persName key="thou1">Thomas<lb/> Hough></persName>'s. </p>

                <p> The weather much the same. I continue<lb/> tolerable well in health; but weak
                    and some cough.<lb/> Attended the meeting as yesterday. Dined at <persName
                        key="nwai1">N.<lb/> Wain</persName>'s, and lodged at <persName key="jjam3"
                        >John James</persName>'s. </p>

                        key="phila"/></dateline>
                <p> The meeting assem-<lb/>bledagain at nine o'clock, and the business
                    conclu-<lb/>ded before twelve, in solemn quiet, and, I believe,<lb/> to the
                    satisfaction of all present. After which, I <lb/>dined with my friend <persName
                        key="dbaco1">David Bacon</persName>, and returned to <lb/><placeName
                        key="germa">Germantown</placeName> with my kind friend, <persName
                        key="jjohn5">John Johnson</persName>,<lb/> who had also attended all the
                    sittings of this Yearly<lb/> Meeting. The sickness in town continues as
                    here-<lb/>tofore. Divers friends in the city are paying con-<lb/>stant attention
                    to the sick — providing necessaries,<lb/> nurses, coffins, and carriers of the
                    dead. At which<lb/> I felt glad, and hope they will be rewarded for their<lb/>
                    labours in so great and charitable a work. </p>
