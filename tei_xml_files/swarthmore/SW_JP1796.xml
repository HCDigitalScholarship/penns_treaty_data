                <p>The John Peirce journal is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of
                    Swarthmore College. In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students enrolled
                    in English 50A (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American
                    Literature”) transcribed this manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible.</p>
            </projectDesc>
            <editorialDecl>
                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases. </p>
                <p>The author of the original journal does not include page numbers on his
                    manuscript; the page numbers have been interpolated by the transcribers to
                    correspond with the manuscript sheets.</p>

                        preparing,<lb/> took a walk with our Land-<lb/>lord to view the following

                        in the Northwest<lb/> Angle, formed by the Meeting of the <geogName

                        <geogName key="catsk2">Cats.Kill Creek</geogName> which raised,<lb/> as I

                        Bed of said Waters, three<lb/> Days since, broke near the Extre-<lb/>mity of
                        the Ellivation; and one<lb/> part of it sunk almost perpen-<lb/>dicularly
                        down between 50 &amp;<lb/> 60 feet, next adjoining the great-<lb/>est
                        Elevation, and gradually up<lb/> toward the Declivity of<lb/> the Hill,
                        leaving the ground<lb/> almost level; the Quantity<lb/> moved was about two

                        <pb n="10" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_011"/> indeed it was an amazing and<lb/>
                        Solemn Sight, the Stupendous<lb/> Cracks and broken Earth made<lb/> an awful
                        appearance; The<lb/> Inhabitants of a small town over the Creek saw it
                        going, and<lb/> were much alarmed, supposing<lb/> it to have been the
                        Beginning<lb/> of an Earthquake, but they<lb/> heard no rumbling, nor
                        discovered<lb/>any Shock: there was also on this<lb/> Hill when it sunk a
                        flock of<lb/> Sheep grazing, which appeared<lb/> much frighted with the
                        first<lb/> Motion of the Earth, <del>and</del>(as it<lb/> sunk gradually)
                        and ran vio-<lb/>lently several Courses at first,<lb/> but quickly gathered
                        all close<lb/>

                        went down with the Ground,<lb/> and received no hurt. </p>
                    <p> After Breakfast ferried over<lb/> this Creek, and proceeded on,<lb/> dined

                        here we put up our Horses<lb/> at an Inn, and lodged some<lb/> of us at a

                        Some time with this tribe<lb/> in the Capacity of an In-<lb/>structor in

                    <pb n="26" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_027"/>
                    <p> This respectable Man also<lb/> informed us, that he believed<lb/> the
                        general Disposition of<lb/> the people in those parts,<lb/> tho’ so near the
                        frontiers, would<lb/> be very favorable to our Bu-<lb/>siness; which was to
                        our En-<lb/>couragement; as we had met<lb/> with Evincements of a<lb/>
                        contrary Disposition<lb/> about 40 Miles further<lb/> down the River.</p>
                    <p> After Dinner agreed to go<lb/> forward into the Indian Country;<lb/> we were
                        informed it was about<lb/> 20 Miles to the <orgName key="stockbridge"
                            >Stockbridge</orgName><lb/> Settlement, where we wished<lb/>
                        <pb n="27" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_028"/> to go this Evening: We rode<lb/>
                        about 9 miles through the<lb/> white Settlements, and stopping<lb/> at a
                        House to enquire the<lb/> way, we found it to be the last<lb/> belonging to
                        white people:</p>
                    <p> Here we met with an In-<lb/>dian, who knowing, or at least<lb/> mistrusting
                        us, by our Appear<lb/>ance, shewed great Friendship,<lb/> calling us
                        Brothers &amp; Quakers,<lb/> and offered to pilot us to the<lb/> Indian
                        Settlement; but being<lb/> much in Liquor, and having a<lb/> Gun and
                        Hatchet, it appeared<lb/> some Trial to accept his Of-<lb/>fer; more
                        especially as the<lb/> Evening was approaching;<lb/>
                        <pb n="28" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_029"/> but understanding the Road<lb/> was
                        difficult, and not a single<lb/> House to be found on it, we<lb/> at length
                        concluded to Submit<lb/> to it: He was one of the <orgName key="oneida"
                            >Oneida’s</orgName>,<lb/> and appeared very wild and sa-<lb/>vage, and
                        would frequently make<lb/> a loud, and frightful shouting<lb/> as he went
                        through the Woods;<lb/> but he brought us Safe to a<lb/> Small Indian
                        Settlement of<lb/> the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>, within about
                        three<lb/> Miles of <persName key="haupa1">Captain

                            >Stockbridge</orgName>, where<lb/> we had proposed going, but<lb/> Night
                        being come upon us,<lb/> we concluded to take up our<lb/> Lodging here;
                        which we<lb/>
                        <pb n="29" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_030"/> accordingly did, having rid-<lb/>den
                        about 17 miles, of Such<lb/>17. Roads, particularly the<lb/> last half of
                        it, as none of<lb/> our company excepting<lb/> our Indian Guide, had<lb/>
                        ever seen before.</p>
                    <p> Here we began our Indian<lb/> Fare, took our Blankets for our<lb/> Beds, and
                        Saddles for our <unclear>pillows</unclear>;<lb/> and supped on Milk, with
                        a<lb/> little Indian Bread in it, having<lb/> wooden spoons, or Ladles
                        to<lb/> sup it out of a large general<lb/> Reservoir:</p>
                    <p> But I believe we were all<lb/> favored with quiet and easy<lb/> Minds;
                        though we were cold<lb/> in the Night, and Sore and<lb/>
                        <pb n="30" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_031"/> Stiff in the Morning. </p>
                    <p> The Name of our Host was<lb/>
                        <persName key="hsmit1">Hendrick Smith</persName>, who with his<lb/> Brother
                        in law, a Stockbridge, could<lb/> talk a little English: He had<lb/> 18 Head
                        of horned Cattle, Several<lb/> of his Cows were excellent; he<lb/> had about
                        three Acres of Indian<lb/> Corn planted, and enclosed, and<lb/> a grass Lot
                        of nearly equal<lb/> Dimensions also enclosed; and<lb/> had made some
                        preparations<lb/> for building a new House; but<lb/> he said he was afraid
                        to build;<lb/> for by and by his Chiefs would<lb/> sell the Land to white
                        people,<lb/> and then he should have to<lb/> leave it; he wished we
                        would<lb/> make their Chiefs divide<lb/>
                        <pb n="31" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_032"/> the Land and let every one<lb/> have
                        his own Share; and<lb/> then, he said, he would clear<lb/> a great deal:
                        This he and<lb/> his Brother-in-law informed us,<lb/> was what the Indians
                        wanted;<lb/> but their Chiefs would not<lb/> agree to it.</p>
                    <p> This Sentiment appeared<lb/> to be accompanied with<lb/> Rationality, and
                        some of<lb/> us were ready to adopt Se-<lb/>cret Conclusions, that it<lb/>
                        would be our Duty to give<lb/> it our Interest; but upon<lb/> further
                        acquaintance with<lb/> those people, and more minute-<lb/>ly investigating
                        the Subject,<lb/> we found, that it<lb/>
                        <pb n="32" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_033"/> had its origin, perhaps with<lb/> the
                        greater part who<lb/> approved it, in a Disposition<lb/> very contrary to
                        what we would<lb/> wish to encourage amongst<lb/> them; viz. that of being
                        indivi-<lb/>dually able to sell and lease<lb/> Lands to the white people;
                        which<lb/> power had been heretofore suf-<lb/>ficiently proven
                        prejudicial<lb/> to several of the Tribes, now<lb/> living in this
                        reservation, by<lb/> tending finally to root them<lb/> out of their native
                        possessions.</p>
                    <p> There nevertheless appears<lb/> great Room for prudent Exer-<lb/>tions to
                        encourage and assist<lb/> these people, in falling up-<lb/>on some safe plan
                        of securing<lb/>
                        <pb n="33" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_034"/> to Individuals, and their

                        whilst Improve-<lb/>ments remain in the present<lb/> precarious State, the

                    <p>This Morning our Indian<lb/> Host, came in and told us his<lb/> Horse was

                        Town;<lb/> with whom we went, and ariving<lb/> at his Habitation, we were

                        meanness of it; but having<lb/> no prospect of bettering ourselves,<lb/> we
                        very deliberately lit, and after<lb/> some time ventured in, but our<lb/>
                        surprise was soon turned into<lb/> astonishment, when we saw<lb/> the Table
                        spread for our Break-<lb/>fast; the Tea Tackling was<lb/> brought out; good
                        wheat Bread,<lb/>

                    <p> This being first Day, we<lb/> felt our Minds engaged, to set<lb/> down

                        Spiritual Worship; and about<lb/> eleven OClock, having obtained<lb/> leave
                        of our Host, who appears<lb/> a serious, sensible Man, we sat<lb/> down, in
                        Company with him,<lb/> his Family, and Several of<lb/> his Indian Neighbors,
                        who,<lb/> without any Invitation from us,<lb/> came in; they

                        and appeared<lb/> thoughtful<lb/>

                        shewed some Uneasiness with<lb/> our Silence: A few Words were<lb/> Spoken,
                        informing that none<lb/> of our Number were public<lb/> Ministers, and
                        pointing out<lb/> the necessity of inward and<lb/> Spiritual Worship.</p>
                    <p> In the Evening of this Day<lb/> had a Conference with

                        about<lb/> the Close of the American War;<lb/> and was confirmed by

                        <pb n="42" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_043"/> to remark, that we have<lb/> found,

                        scrupulously<lb/> guarded in the Letters they<lb/> send to these people; for
                        we<lb/> find them very ingenious<lb/> in construing them to their<lb/> own

                        horned Cat-<lb/>tle, 2 Yoke of Oxen, and one plow;<lb/> and have the Offer

                    <p> These people reminded us<lb/> of an Expectation given them<lb/> by Friends

                        but<lb/> we found them very imperfect<lb/> in their Knowledge of the<lb/>

                        which we proceeded<lb/> to shew them the Advantage and<lb/> necessity of a
                        Change in their<lb/> Manner of Life; that their young<lb/> Men ought to
                        work, and be indus-<lb/>trious to plow and sow their Land,<lb/> to raise
                        Grain to make Bread<lb/> for themselves; and for their<lb/> old People and
                        Children who could<lb/> not work; and that they should<lb/> get many Cows to
                        give them<lb/> Milk; and keep Sheep and<lb/>
                        <pb n="49" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_050"/> Such Things like the white<lb/>
                        people do; and that their<lb/> Women should learn to spin<lb/> the wool that
                        would come off<lb/> their Sheep, to make them<lb/> Blankets and Clothes, to
                        keep<lb/> them and their Children<lb/> warm in cold Weather; and<lb/> that
                        we were willing to shew<lb/> them how to do those things;<lb/> that some of
                        our young men<lb/> would stay a while with them,<lb/> (if they were

                        (for we had before<lb/> united in the Belief that this<lb/> was the most
                        fruitable place<lb/> to make our Settlement) but<lb/>
                        <pb n="50" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_051"/> but informed them withal, that<lb/>
                        they ought not depend too much<lb/> on their Brothers, the Quakers,<lb/> for
                        help; but that they must try<lb/> to help themselves; that we were<lb/>
                        willing to assist them a little<lb/> in the Beginning; but as we<lb/> wanted
                        to help all their In-<lb/>dian Brothers a little, and<lb/> as there was a
                        great many<lb/> of them, they could not expect<lb/> that we could do a great
                        deal<lb/> for any one Nation; and more-<lb/>over, as we saw they had a
                        great<lb/> deal of very good Land; an as we<lb/> were willing to shew
                        them<lb/> how to work their good Land,<lb/>
                        <pb n="51" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_052"/> that they might live
                        comfortably,<lb/> and have plenty of every thing, if<lb/> they would but
                        take our Advice,<lb/> and learn to work, and to be in-<lb/>dustrious, sober,
                        and saving; but<lb/> if they would not be persuaded<lb/> to help themselves,
                        but would<lb/> still continue to live in their<lb/> old way, that their
                        Brothers<lb/> the Quakers would soon grow<lb/> tired of helping them:
                        after<lb/> we had thus fully opened our<lb/> Prospects, and relieved
                        our<lb/> Minds to them, they gave<lb/> us a short answer expressing<lb/>
                        their Willingness to comply<lb/> with our Advice: The Council<lb/> then
                        braking up they mostly<lb/>
                        <pb n="52" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_053"/> withdrew; but the Chiefs, &amp;<lb/>
                        old Men soon returned, and<lb/> desired to speak a few more<lb/> words to
                        us; which when we<lb/> had agreed to, and were seated<lb/> down, they
                        proceeded to inform,<lb/> that their Women had heard<lb/> the good words
                        that we had said<lb/> to them; and that they had<lb/> now exorted their
                        Husbands &amp;<lb/> all their Men, to mind all<lb/> the good Words that
                        their Bro-<lb/>thers the Quakers, had said<lb/> to them; and that every
                        thing<lb/> that they had said was good;<lb/> and that they ought to do it
                        all.</p>
                    <p> Here it may be proper<lb/>
                        <pb n="53" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_054"/> to remark, that truly the<lb/> women
                        have great Cause<lb/> to be on our side in this Bu-<lb/>siness; for in
                        proportion to<lb/> the Rudeness, and uncultiva-<lb/>tion of these people,
                        are the<lb/> Hardships and Difficulties<lb/> of their Women greatly
                        increas-<lb/>ed; for where the Men think<lb/> it a reproach for them to
                        work,<lb/> all the Chopping, Howing &amp;c.<lb/> necessarily fall upon
                        their<lb/> Women: and as they increase<lb/> in Civilization, as is
                        evident<lb/> in the <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> and
                            <orgName key="brotherton">Bro-<lb/>thertown’s</orgName>, the women
                        are<lb/> gradually relieved from this<lb/> Drudgery, and their Labours<lb/>
                        con <pb n="54" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_055"/> confined more of their Houses,
                        and<lb/> amongst their Children, where<lb/> they ought to be.</p>
                    <p> And such has lately been the<lb/> Case, as we are creditably informed,<lb/>
                        among the <orgName key="oneida">Oneida’s</orgName>, that if a<lb/> Man was
                        catched caught by his friend<lb/> cutting off a stick of wood, or
                        how-<lb/>ing a Hill of Corn, he would<lb/> appear as much ashamed, as<lb/>
                        if he had been caught in a dis-<lb/>honorable or wicked Action.</p>
                    <p> At the Close of this Council<lb/> we had a Conference with the<lb/> Chiefs;
                        from which, and our<lb/> own Observations, we learn,<lb/> that the <orgName
                            key="oneida">Oneida’s</orgName> possess a<lb/> large Tract of excellent Land,<lb/>
                        <pb n="55" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_056"/> supposed to be about 12 miles<lb/> by
                        20: They consist of about<lb/> 620 Individuals, have an In-<lb/>come from
                        general Govern-<lb/>ment of 700 Dollars a year;<lb/> out of which
                        Government<lb/> has Liberty to furnish them<lb/> with a Smith and
                        Materials;<lb/> which has been done at the<lb/> Expense of about 200
                        Dollars<lb/> a year; they have also Liberty<lb/> out of this Sum to
                        furnish<lb/> them with a School, by employ-<lb/>ing a Schoolmaster, which
                        is<lb/> not done, said to be from the<lb/> Difficulty of getting a
                        suitable<lb/> Teacher; which we regret, as such<lb/>
                        <pb n="56" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_057"/> an Institution, if rightly
                        under-<lb/>taken and prosecuted must cer-<lb/>tainly be much more
                        advanta-<lb/>geous to these people than<lb/> the Money.</p>
                    <p> They have also about<lb/> 5000 Dollars annually<lb/> coming in from the
                        State<lb/> of New York; they have also<lb/> a Sawmill built by
                        Govern-<lb/>ment; and a Gristmill begun;<lb/> which Government are
                        under<lb/> Obligations to complete.</p>
                    <p> They have a considerable Num-<lb/>ber of horned Cattle, Horses,<lb/> and
                        some good working Cattle.</p>
                    <p> From the above Delineation<lb/>
                        <pb n="57" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_058"/> of the Circumstances and
                        Si-<lb/>tuation of these people, it must<lb/> evidently appear; that
                        their<lb/> Chance for a comfortable Sub-<lb/>stance far exceeds that of<lb/>
                        the majority of the white<lb/> Inhabitants of Pennsylvania<lb/> and parts
                        adjacent. - That<lb/> in short there appears but<lb/> little in the way of
                        their<lb/> becoming good Livers but<lb/> their excessive Indolence,<lb/>
                        want of Oeconomy, and Love<lb/> of Strong Drink; in the latter<lb/> of which
                        Some Exertions have<lb/> been made by the old Men<lb/> and Chiefs here, as
                        well as<lb/>
                        <pb n="58" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_059"/> amongst the <orgName

                        each<lb/> place, been concerned to Strength-<lb/>en these Exertions; yet it
                        is<lb/> Sorrowfully evident, that they<lb/> too frequently find Means

                                Brothers,<lb/> in this Distress, we your elder<lb/> Brother took
                                pity upon you,<lb/> and gave you this Dish, that<lb/> you might put
                                a spoon into<lb/> it and live; and in order<lb/>
                                <pb n="63" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_064"/> that our younger Brother
                                should<lb/> never get such trouble again,<lb/> we made this Dish of

                                may be made of<lb/> Wood, and then it will soon<lb/> get broke, and
                                you will<lb/> have no Dish againt: No Brothers,<lb/> we will not do
                                this, but we<lb/> will try to mend your spoon<lb/> for you, so that

                                only bent<lb/> a little, and we will try to<lb/> straighten it for
                                you: And now<lb/> Brothers, in order to straiten the<lb/> Spoon you
                                must dig a Hole<lb/> in the Ground, and you must<lb/> dig it deep,

                                endeavor to promote the<lb/> Good of their Nation; and<lb/> you also

                                keeping the same Rules among<lb/> us, the Chiefs of our Nation,<lb/>

                            <p> Brothers, We will observe another<lb/> thing, our young Men
                                have<lb/> told you, that we draw writings,<lb/> and these writings
                                are signed<lb/> by many; and they could not<lb/> understand these
                                writings;<lb/> and therefore would not sign<lb/> them: you also,
                                Brothers, seem<lb/> to be astonished yourselves at these
                                things;<lb/> you say, you do not know how<lb/> these writings should
                                come,<lb/> and why they should be signed:<lb/> Now Brothers, we
                                acknowledge<lb/> we have such writings, and<lb/> if you desire, you
                                shall hear<lb/> these writings, that ye shall<lb/> rightly
                                understand them; but<lb/>
                                <pb n="76" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_077"/> before I read you this
                                wri-<lb/>ting, we shall let you know,<lb/> that our Chiefs always
                                had<lb/> in their Hearts the welfare<lb/> of the Nation, and often
                                con-<lb/>templated what would be<lb/> most for the welfare of
                                the<lb/> whole nation; and about<lb/> twelve years ago, before
                                we<lb/> come to your Country, we found<lb/> it would be for our
                                Welfare, to<lb/> make a Strong Covenant, to<lb/> keep us together,
                                and draw<lb/> writings to keep out Memory<lb/> bright; so long as we
                                maintain<lb/> that agreement, we find it<lb/>
                                <pb n="77" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_078"/> do us good, and five years
                                ago,<lb/> since we come to this town,<lb/> we renew that Covenant;
                                and<lb/> since that, now lately, we be-<lb/>gin to see the same
                                spirit<lb/> which had made Disturbance<lb/> amongst us before, and
                                which<lb/> must inevitably bring ruin<lb/> both to the spirituals
                                and tem-<lb/>porals; therefore the Chiefs<lb/> was alarmed, and
                                believe it<lb/> their Duty to use their law-<lb/>ful Endeavour to
                                frustrate<lb/> that Design; and they called<lb/> the Nation together
                                in general<lb/> Council, to consult what shall<lb/> be done, and
                                they agreed to enter<lb/> into<lb/>
                                <pb n="78" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_079"/> into Covenant, and draw
                                writings,<lb/> and sign them: now Brothers,<lb/> I will read you the

                                that<lb/> we never should take trouble<lb/> to ourselves, in

                            <p> 3rd. The Said united Inhabitants<lb/> of this town, shall equally

                            <p> 4th. All those who refuse to<lb/> join in this happy Union<lb/>
                                shall be positively excluded<lb/> from all the aforesaid

                            <p> 5th. Public meetings shall<lb/> be free and open, the Sachems<lb/>
                                and Chiefs of the Nation shall<lb/> be respected and obeyed in

                            <p> 6th. If any of the members<lb/> of the Union be in distress,

                            <p> Brothers, We must have some<lb/> Land to work upon; and we

                            <p> Brothers, If we think there is<lb/> Encouragement to undertake<lb/>
                                more another year, we shall<lb/> ask you for it seasonably, and<lb/>
                                agree together where it shall<lb/> be. </p>
                            <p> Brothers, You know it is hard-<lb/>ly practicable for all to learn<lb/>
                                <del>at once</del> together; we will begin<lb/> with a few, who much
                                stick<lb/> to the work; the rest will see<lb/> how they get forward,
                                and<lb/> be ready to take their turn<lb/> when it comes round; we
                                want<lb/> to engage five or eight Sober<lb/> young Men as
                                Apprentices<lb/> till next Spring. </p>
                            <pb n="112" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_113"/>
                            <p> Brothers,<lb/> We suppose you will<lb/> be willing, that we should

                                that<lb/> you will allow us some<lb/> Suitable grass Lots to

                                railing, and<lb/> Timber for building in your<lb/> Woods; have the
                                use of the Saw-<lb/>mill, and Smith’s shop, when<lb/> we have
                                occasion for them;<lb/> and sometimes work your<lb/> Horses and Oxen
                                when<lb/> they are not wanted by you.</p>
                            <pb n="113" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_114"/>
                            <p> Brothers,<lb/> You are to under-<lb/>stand that our Friends are<lb/>
                                to live plentifully, as their<lb/> own people do at home,<lb/> and
                                their live stock are<lb/> also to be kept by the pro-<lb/>duce of

                                be<lb/> divided amongst the young<lb/> Indian Apprentices; that
                                they<lb/> may enjoy the fruit of<lb/> their Labour; and have<lb/> some-<lb/>
                                <pb n="114" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_115"/> something to begin with<lb/>
                                for themselves, when other<lb/> Apprentices are taken in<lb/> their

                                and we request you to appoint<lb/> three of your Chiefs to
                                unite<lb/> with our Friends as Judges,<lb/> that if four of them
                                agree,<lb/> the person offending may<lb/> be justly discharged.</p>

                            <p> Before you cover your<lb/> Council, we beg your<lb/>

                                in<lb/> the remembrance of the friendship<lb/> you have manifested
                                towards them in<lb/> all their Treaties.</p>
                            <p> We ourselves have held Councils at<lb/> different Times to
                                contemplate the<lb/> welfare of our nations because we<lb/> cannot
                                but groan to see our Situation:<lb/> It is also melancholy to
                                reflect on<lb/> the ways of our forefathers.</p>
                            <p> Brothers</p>
                            <p> You are sometimes sorry<lb/> to see the deplorable Situation of
                                your<lb/> Indian Brethren, for which<lb/> you have given us many
                                good<lb/> Counsels; tho’ we feel ourselves<lb/> willing to follow
                                your Coun-<lb/>sels, but it has made no Effect<lb/> as<lb/>
                                <pb n="191" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_192"/> as yet. Our Situation
                                is<lb/> Still miserable: Our Ancesters<lb/> were conquered
                                immediately<lb/> after you came over this Island<lb/> by the Strong
                                Hero, who does<lb/> still reign among Indian<lb/> Tribes with
                                Tyranny; who<lb/> has robbed us every Thing that<lb/> was precious
                                in our Eyes:<lb/> But we not mention every<lb/> Thing particular how
                                this<lb/> Tyrant has used us; for your<lb/> Eyes have been open to
                                behold<lb/> our doleful Situation; By the<lb/> power of our Enemy
                                our Eyes<lb/> have been blinded Our young<lb/> Men seem become
                                willing<lb/> Slaves to this despotic Heroe<lb/> so<lb/>
                                <pb n="192" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_193"/> so that we displeased

                                our<lb/> mighty men: In looking<lb/> forward we see the
                                Desola-<lb/>tion of our Tribes. Our<lb/> Chiefs have used their
                                Endea-<lb/>vours to reform their respective<lb/> people, but having
                                seen<lb/> no Success they seem dis-<lb/>couraged, and hang down<lb/>
                                their Heads.</p>

                        Beginning; and that<lb/> it could not reasonably be<lb/> expected, that we
                        should go<lb/> into all that was mentioned<lb/> in that Letter at once:
                        They<lb/> appeared to be pretty well<lb/> reconciled to our plan; and<lb/>
                        expressed their Readiness<lb/> to adopt it; and recommend-<lb/>ed to their

                        This Council was however not<lb/> quite so satisfactory as could<lb/> have

                        In the Evening<lb/> returned to our Lodgings at<lb/>

                    <p>This morning had<lb/> a very solid and satisfactory<lb/> parting with the

                        felt our Minds disposed<lb/> to sit down together to wait,<lb/> for the

                        expressed a Desire to<lb/> have an Oppertunity with<lb/> the Indians, many

                        under an Expectation of the<lb/> Goods being divided, and some<lb/> of us
                        also haveing a like Desire,<lb/> not being fully relieved by<lb/> the

                        Council:-</p>
                    <p> This proved a much more<lb/> Satisfactory Oppertunity than<lb/> that of
                        yesterday; our Hearts being<lb/> enlarged with unfeigned Love<lb/> towards
                        them, much Counsel<lb/> was communicated pertinent<lb/> to their Situations;
                        which was<lb/> sensibly felt by some of them,<lb/> especially of the Women,
                        who<lb/> are in general much more<lb/> Solid and reachable than<lb/> the

                    <p> After which they<lb/>
                        <pb n="201" facs="SW_JP1796_Page_202"/> made us a short Speech,
                        ex-<lb/>pressive of their Satisfaction<lb/> with this opportunity; and<lb/>
                        our Business in general; <del>among</del><lb/>
                        <del>them;</del> Observing that all the<lb/> Time we had been amongst<lb/>
                        them we had spoken the same<lb/> Language, and made no Change<lb/> in our
                        Words or Conduct.</p>
                    <p> After which a venerable<lb/> old woman, on behalf of her-<lb/>self and
                        Sisters, observed in<lb/> substance, That it was not<lb/> common for their
                        women<lb/> to speak in Council; but<lb/> that they were very glad<lb/> to
                        hear our good Words, and<lb/> heartily thanked us.</p>

                        hire men to come there to do<lb/> their work from them, whilst they<lb/>
                        themselves lived in Idleness, &amp;<lb/> spent their own Money

                    <p> Upon proposing to them the<lb/> propriety of their buying Oxen &amp;<lb/>

                        &amp;c. they answered, that they had<lb/> concluded to buy a pair of

                        and such things:</p>
                    <p> We were deeply affected with<lb/> the unreasonableness of their<lb/>

                        our Situation became<lb/> trying, and a spirit of Sympa-<lb/>thy and tender
                        feeling for each<lb/> other was sensibly experienced,<lb/> to the tendering

                        pros-<lb/>pects, and a Spirit of brotherly<lb/> Condiscension prevailing, it
                        was<lb/> at length resulted, as most safe<lb/> to<lb/>
