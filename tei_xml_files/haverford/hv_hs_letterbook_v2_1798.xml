                 <p>Dear Friends,
                 <lb/>We arrived at this place in two
                 <lb/>days from the time we left you; we had
                 <lb/>almost as trying a ride, with regard to
                 <lb/>road, the day after we left <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguh-
                 <lb/>tau</placeName>, as we had at any time experienced
                 <lb/>on our way there; and about noon had as
                 <lb/>heavy a shower of rain, which lasted for
                 <lb/>more than an hour, as we could recollect
                 <lb/>ever being our in; we came to <placeName key="catar">Catarawguo
                 <lb/>river</placeName> a little before sunset; our pilot
                 <lb/><persName key="checkplace">John</persName> made signs to us that the water
                 <lb/>would run over our horses backs, and from
                 <lb/>its
                 <pb n="12" facs="hv_hs_letterbook_v2_1798_012"/>
                 <lb/>its violence, sweep them down the river, we
                 <lb/>therefore concluded to encamp, and having
                 <lb/>found a sand bank a piece back from the
                 <lb/>river, John seemed to pitch upon this
                 <lb/>place as most eligible for our quarters, and
                 <lb/>soon struck us up a fire, round which we
                 <lb/>hung some of our wet things, and having
                 <lb/>let out our horses to provide for themselves, we
                 <lb/>made some warm chocolate for our suppers
                 <lb/>out of very muddy water, which we carri-
                 <lb/>ed in our tins nearly half a mile, soon
                 <lb/>after which we disposed ourselves for rest,
                 <lb/>and were favoured to forget our difficul-
                 <lb/>ties for a while in refreshing sleep: we
                 <lb/>must not forget to add, for your con-
                 <lb/>solation, that you know but little
                 <lb/>about

                 <lb/>about moschetoes and gnats at <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguh-
                 <lb/>tau</placeName>, in comparison with the banks of <placeName key="catar">Cata-
                 <lb/>rawgus</placeName>. You will readily believe
                 <lb/>we rose by times on sixth day morning,
                 <lb/>and leaving our bed as well as we formed it,
                 <lb/>we took a walk to the rivers bank, and
                 <lb/>thought we could perceive marks of its
                 <lb/>having fallen three or four Inches finer
                 <lb/>last evening; we therefore concluded
                 <lb/>crossing as soon  as we could convenient-
                 <lb/>ly make ready, and soon after mount-
                 <lb/>ing our horses, we approached the river
                 <lb/>about fourty perches above the common
                 <lb/>foarding; and our <persName key="checkplace">pilot John</persName> ma-
                 <lb/>nifested considerable fear of crossing,
                 <lb/>and absolutely refused going in
                 <lb/>foremost,
                 <pb n="14" facs="hv_hs_letterbook_v2_1798_014"/>
                 <lb/>foremost, which task fell, as you would

                 <lb/>make a short history of a short travail,
                 <lb/>we all got over safe with our pilot in the
                 <lb/>rear, and proceeded down the river,
                 <lb/>through a fertile Country, about 9 miles
                 <lb/>to <placeName key="catta1">Catarawgus village</placeName>, of maney Indians
                 <lb/>Where we breakfasted, and had an op-
                 <lb/>pertunity of informing about 30 of
                 <lb/>their principle Men, what we had
                 <lb/>been doing among the Indians, and
                 <lb/>also gave them some advice, then pro-

                 <lb/>we wish to be able to give the Indi-

                 <lb/>it would be a great accommoda-
                 <lb/>tion to us if a good milch Cow was
                 <lb/>sent with them. and the one we
                 <lb/>have at present will do for Beef
                 <lb/>next Fall. We also think it
                 <lb/>may tend to the promotion of
                 <lb/>the Work; and believe it expedi-
                 <lb/>ent to submit to you, the con-

                 <p>Dear Friends,
                 <lb/>I wrote to you (I think)
                 <lb/>some time in the last month from
                 <lb/><placeName key="monmo">Monmouth County. New Jersey</placeName>, to
                 <lb/>which place I had removed with my
                 <lb/>family, on account of the awful
                 <lb/>Visitation of Sickness, under which
                 <lb/>many of the Inhabitants of this
                 <lb/>City were Labouring: and which
                 <lb/>continued untill about the fifth of this
                 <lb/>month, When it pleased the great
                 <lb/>dispower of Events to cause a dis-
                 <lb/>pensation of more general Health;
                 <lb/>In the course of about three mon-
                 <lb/>ths, near three Thousand five
                 <lb/>Hundred of my fellow Citizens
                 <lb/>have been removed from this
                 <lb/>Earthly Scene, in the City; and

                 <lb/>many have ended their Lives in the Neigh-

                 <lb/>only that has to Mourn her Slain; Several

                 <lb/>sed some of their most Valuable mem-
                 <lb/>bers. About thirteen of the friends
                 <lb/>who came to the City at the Usual
                 <lb/>time of holding the <orgName key="pym">Yearly Meeting</orgName>
                 <lb/>were by this Disease removed, amon-

                 <lb/><placeName key="wilmi">Wilmington</placeName>, where the Mortality was
                 <lb/>such, that three Sisters were seen

                 <lb/>which the Indians assisted us in doing

                 <lb/>and we are not without a hope
                 <lb/>that things are bettering in that

                 <lb/>Dear Friends,

                 <lb/>23rd</date> was received and read in the

                 <lb/>contents, affording general satisfac-
                 <lb/>tion, a revival of that general sym-
                 <lb/>pathy was felt, which freequently
                 <lb/>accompanies our minds on your be-
                 <lb/>half, secluded as you are from
                 <lb/>the sosiety you have been accus-
                 <lb/>tomed to; yet where an evidence
                 <lb/>attends the mind, that we are in
                 <lb/>our proper alotments in abedi-
                 <lb/>ence to Him, who has a right to
                 <lb/>our services, in such situations
                 <lb/>and exercise of duty as he is pleas-
                 <lb/>ed to manifest; those things

                 <lb/>trying and irksome, are make
                 <lb/>easy. Your intimation of a

                 <lb/>Children to reside near you, in
                 <lb/>Winter, perhaps by so doing, the
                 <lb/>School will be smaller, but we
                 <lb/>hope quite as useful to such as do
                 <lb/>attend, and afford you more
                 <lb/>comfort and satisfaction; believ-
                 <lb/>ing you will strengthen and
                 <lb/>encourage each other, and be less
                 <lb/>exposed by residing as much to-
                 <lb/>gether as may be. We would
                 <lb/>not wish to be understood as
                 <lb/>disapproving of the trial al-
                 <lb/>ready made, but feel a solici-

                 <lb/>to you, that we believe it will afford
                 <lb/>the most general satisfaction, and be
                 <lb/>most advantageous to the Indians
                 <lb/>for the School to be kept up at the
                 <lb/>lower Village, while three suitable
                 <lb/>persons are stationed in this
                 <lb/>quarter, as the Children are most
                 <lb/>ly there, and but little hopes of any of
                 <lb/>them comeing to reside nearer to us.
                 <lb/>but the prospect of one of us returning
                 <lb/>this fall, will probably prevent
                 <lb/>the School being kept up at that
                 <lb/>place the ensueing Winter, unless

                 <lb/>may soon raise abundance of

                 <lb/>ing your Land, but if you will
                 <lb/>spend your money,  that you
                 <lb/>should buy Cattle &amp; other use-
