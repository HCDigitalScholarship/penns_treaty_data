    <lb/>went to <persName key="agibb1">Abraham Gibbons</persName> 11 miles here
    <lb/>by appointment met with <persName key="jswai1">Joel Swain</persName>
    <lb/>and <persName key="hjack1">Holliday Jackson</persName>, two young

    <lb/>went 7 miles to <placeName key="lanca">Lancaster</placeName> where stopp-

    <lb/>on to <placeName key="wrigh">Wright’s ferry</placeName> 12 miles on <placeName key="susqu">Susque-

    <lb/>laid out it contains 20 or more good

    <lb/>was lined with many thousand feet
    <lb/>of white Pine Boards, which had
    <lb/>been rafted down the said River.

    <lb/>with good Stone Houses and Barns
    <lb/>a large proportion of the Land was
    <lb/>sown with rye; some of the wheat
    <lb/>fields looked pretty well but gene
    <lb/>rally poor; Clover not so forward

    <p>A rainy morning stayed un
    <lb/>der shelter till 8 OClock, and then
    <lb/>crossed the river in the rain; the
    <lb/>said river is one mile and 12 pearches
    <lb/>wide. paid for Man and Horse 6 d a
    <lb/>cheap ferry, thence to <placeName key="yorkt">York town</placeName> 12 miles
    <lb/>mostly through a Valley perhaps 18
    <lb/>or more miles wide some beautiful
    <lb/>meadows made their appearance
    <lb/>more particularly within a few
    <lb/>miles of the river and this town. The

    <lb/>Land appeard to be of a good quality
    <lb/>and well farmed.
   </p><p>The <placeName key="yorkt">town of York</placeName> has an
    <lb/>agreeable appearance in which there
    <lb/>are a number of good buildings, it is
    <lb/>beautifyed by a large stream of water
    <lb/>called <placeName key="cocor">Codoras</placeName> <del>Creek</del> which runs throuh
    <lb/>it we dined at a public house then set
    <lb/>off for <persName key="iever1">Isaac Everets</persName>.
   </p><p>In 2 or 3 miles after we left this
    <lb/>town we got out of the Lime stone Valley
    <lb/>and passed through a country diver
    <lb/>sisyed with gentle ascents and decents
    <lb/>pretty clear of stones; the land in places
    <lb/>thin tho well watered by the branches
    <lb/>of the <placeName key="concr">Conowagoe</placeName>, the main stream was
    <lb/>nearly as large as <placeName key="brand"><placeName key="brand">Brandywine</placeName></placeName>, the win-

    <lb/>this had been a pleasant ride to day, the
    <lb/>wind being at Northwest and pretty
    <lb/><pb n="8" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_008"/>
    <lb/>cool; stopped at <persName key="jgarr1">John Garrisons</persName> 17 miles
    <lb/>where we fed our horses and got some
    <lb/>refreshment, then some of us went to

    <p>Set off early this morning and in
    <lb/>about 3 miles came to a large hill
    <lb/>called the First, or <placeName key="bluem">Blue Mountain</placeName>,
    <lb/>which was 4 miles across, we then en-
    <lb/>tred a body of Limestone land hav<del>e</del>ing
    <lb/>crossed the <placeName key="yello">Yellow Breeches</placeName> a large stream.
    <lb/>the face of the Country <del>dry</del> pretty level
    <lb/>and much of it<del>n</del> under culture Rye
    <lb/>which is the prevailing winter grain
    <lb/>mostly poor, Clover scarcely made its appea-
    <lb/>rance in any of the fields, which for want
    <lb/>of better farming were very bare of Pasture
    <lb/>fed at the black horse 14 miles, then to
    <lb/><placeName key="shipp">Shippensburgh</placeName> 12 miles; part of this stage
    <lb/>was through a flat Pine bottom, contain
    <lb/><pb n="9" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_009"/>
    <lb/>ing a large number of Ponds of Stagnated
    <lb/>water, but as we advanced nearer the
    <lb/>town we passed through high cham-
    <lb/>paigne land, beautifully timbered, then
    <lb/>crossed a large stream that sprang
    <lb/>up a few perches to our left which of-
    <lb/>ten went dry in the fall. The town
    <lb/>was more than half a mile long
    <lb/>containing (as we were informed) 250
    <lb/>houses a numbe of which were good
    <lb/>stone buildings for 2 or 3 miles after
    <lb/>we left the town we passed through
    <lb/>a beautiful well improved Limestone
    <lb/>country then through land not so good
    <lb/>to <placeName key="stras">Strawsburg</placeName> a village containing per
    <lb/>haps 40 houses, built of squared logs
    <lb/>it stands in a low place hardly dis-
    <lb/>coverable till we get near by it.
    <lb/>shortly after we passed thro’ this town
    <lb/>we began to asscend the blue
    <lb/>mount
    <lb/><pb n="10" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_010"/>
    <lb/>Mountains an high tow’ring
    <lb/>eminenc, steep, and very rocky; in
    <lb/>about 3 miles we arrived at the
    <lb/>bottom of the opposite wide where
    <lb/>we cross’d the main branch of the
    <lb/><placeName key="conod">Conidogwinet</placeName>, and took up our
    <lb/>quarters at <persName key="gskin1">George Skinners</persName>, good
    <lb/>accommodations he has made val

    <lb/>mantic country, 39 miles.

    <p>Set off early, we immediately
    <lb/>asscended another Mountain much
    <lb/>like our last when we arrived
    <lb/>at its summit we had a delight-
    <lb/>ful view of a well improved
    <lb/>valley 2 or more miles in breadth
    <lb/>with a lofty Mountain beyond
    <lb/>just as we entered the Valley we
    <lb/>crossed the <placeName key="conoc">Conecocheague Creek</placeName>,
    <lb/>a beautiful stream, in about a
    <lb/><pb n="11" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_011"/>
    <lb/>half a mile <del>a mile</del> we passed
    <lb/>through <placeName key="checkplace">Planetsburgh</placeName> a Village
    <lb/>of perhaps 30 Log houses, shortly
    <lb/>after we pass’d this town we as-
    <lb/>scend’d the 3rd Mountain much
    <lb/>like the 2 last discribed, from
    <lb/>thence to <persName key="checkplace">Bird’s</persName> at <placeName key="flitt">fort littleton</placeName> 5
    <lb/>miles, through a rough country surrounded
    <lb/>with lofty mountains some pretty
    <lb/>good improved places made their ap
    <lb/>pearance, and the roads considering
    <lb/>the roughness of the country not
    <lb/>to be complained of here we got our
    <lb/>breakfast 12 miles.
   </p><p>From thence to <persName key="jskin1">Skiners</persName> on the
    <lb/>top of <placeName key="sidel">Sidling hill</placeName> 11 miles through a
    <lb/>rough broken poor country, very little
    <lb/>inhabited, Sidling hill, a lofty moun
    <lb/>tain 7 miles cauced us over, we rode<del>d</del>
    <lb/>near 4 miles on its summit which
    <lb/><pb n="12" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_012"/>
    <lb/>was very high, but our prospect
    <lb/>not extensive by reason of the o
    <lb/>ther mountains being near on
    <lb/>each hand but as we began to
    <lb/>decend a noble view presented, as
    <lb/>far as the eye could reach having
    <lb/>the <placeName key="allmo">Allegany mountains</placeName> at full
    <lb/>view twenty or more miles distant
    <lb/>the extensive prospect between look’d
    <lb/>like a beautiful Plain chequered
    <lb/>with few plantations, but when
    <lb/>we came to traverse it we found
    <lb/>many lofty hills or mountains
    <lb/>particularly about the <placeName key="junia">Juniatta
    <lb/>River</placeName> one branch of which we
    <lb/>crossed, which was near 60 yards
    <lb/>wide and more than belly deep
    <lb/>directly upon crossing this stream
    <lb/>we asscended the steepest hill
    <lb/>we met with since we left home
    <lb/><pb n="13" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_013"/>
    <lb/>it is admirable that as many waggons
    <lb/>that pass this should be able to get up
    <lb/>it. I supose we passed by 20 this
    <lb/>day mostly with familyes going to the
    <lb/>new countrys a number of which
    <lb/>were crowded with children 17 people of differ-
    <lb/>ent description belonging to one
    <lb/>waggon. When I viewed the hills
    <lb/>and mountains about this river I
    <lb/>was struck with <del>with</del> admiration
    <lb/>that it ever found its way through
     <lb/>them to the <placeName key="susqu">Susquhanna</placeName>, but I
    <lb/>will asshure my reader that its mean-
    <lb/>ders are various and serpentine for
    <lb/>in 5 or 6 miles after we crossed it
    <lb/>we had said River on each hand
    <lb/>perhaps not more than a half a part.
   </p><p>We took up our quarters at one
    <lb/><persName key="hart1">Hartleys</persName> near the banks of the River
    <lb/>he has a valuable plantation and
    <lb/><pb n="14" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_014"/>
    <lb/>pretty situated.
   </p><p>Most of this days jurney
    <lb/>has been through a very poor-br-
    <lb/>ken and thin settled country 38 m

 </div> <div type="entry">

    <p>Went 6 miles up the <placeName key="junia">Juniatta</placeName>
    <lb/>through rough mountainous
    <lb/>country to <placeName key="bedfo">Bedford</placeName> having about
    <lb/>one mile back crosed the River
    <lb/>on a bridge the town stands
    <lb/>in a Valley surrounded by high

    <lb/>being situated on an elevated spot
    <lb/>near a branch of the river the town
    <lb/>contains a number of good stone
    <lb/>houses, among which are a Court
    <lb/>house and a Jail.
   </p><p>Here we got our breakfast and
    <lb/>then passed over a very mountainous
    <lb/>poor country and but thinly settled
    <lb/>to the <placeName key="allmo">Alleganies</placeName>, which mountain
    <lb/><pb n="15" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_015"/>
    <lb/>tho’ high, was not difficult assending
    <lb/>being rather a succession of mounta
    <lb/>ins than one huge pile, We had seve-
    <lb/>ral very steep asscents and descents
    <lb/>while on this mountain, yet our
    <lb/>road went much of the way on the
    <lb/>top of very high ridges; when we ar-
    <lb/>rived at its greatest eminence we stop-
    <lb/>ped at an inn and refreshed ourselves
    <lb/>here we met with a fine Spring of
    <lb/>water near the Door we here turnd
    <lb/>to the left taken the glade road
    <lb/>the decent from this mountain
    <lb/>was gradual the land arable, tho’
    <lb/>stony.
   </p><p>It is call’d 10 miles across.
   </p><p>We now enter what is call’d the
    <lb/>glades having understood, in places
    <lb/>there where flats or openings where
    <lb/>much gross was cut.
    <lb/><pb n="16" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_016"/>
    <lb/>Yet where we went through, was
    <lb/>heavy timbered some of which
    <lb/>were Sugar Maple being the first
    <lb/>we had seen. The land appeared
    <lb/>good &amp; was pretty thick settled.
   </p><p>We arrived at the dutch-
    <lb/>town called <placeName key="berli">Berlin</placeName> containing up-
    <lb/>wards of 50 houses mostly of Log or
    <lb/>frame where, at the sign of the
    <lb/>black horse, we got good entertainment
    <lb/>36 miles.

 </div> <div type="entry">
    <dateline><date when="1798-05-06">6th</date></dateline>
    <p>We started early this morning with
    <lb/>some hopes of reaching a friends
    <lb/>house this evening which was very
    <lb/>desireable. For 2 or more miles
    <lb/>the land was good and considerable
    <lb/>settled tho’ hilly. Then we entered a
    <lb/>chesnut country the soil thin and in
    <lb/>a while we came among abundance
    <lb/>of Laurel; the road very stony muddy
    <lb/><pb n="17" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_017"/>
    <lb/>and rocky. Thence entered a pine forest
    <lb/>being the first white pine of note we had
    <lb/>met with; here they grew in abundance
    <lb/>tho not very large; But few settle-
    <lb/>ments the greatest part of this stage.
   </p><p>Stopped and got our breakfast at
    <lb/><persName key="checkplace">John Kusiers</persName> 13 miles from thence to <persName key="gbach1">Geo;
    <lb/>Baschelors</persName> 14 miles The whole of this
    <lb/>stage, remarkable rough the first 3 or 4 m
    <lb/>miles the land appeared pretty good
    <lb/>tho’ very hilly; one hill more steep and
    <lb/>long than any we had met with
    <lb/>was as we went down to <placeName key="laucr">laurel hill creek</placeName>
    <lb/>a small stream. from thence to near
    <lb/>this place is call’d <placeName key="laure">laurel hill</placeName>. The whole
    <lb/>of this stage very heavy timbered so that
    <lb/>the hills comparatively speaking groan’d
    <lb/>under their great load, abundance of which
    <lb/>was beautiful Chesnut the finest I ever re-
    <lb/>member to have ever seen with large
    <lb/><pb n="18" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_018"/>
    <lb/>quantity of oak of various kinds some
    <lb/>sugar maple &amp; c. Much of this stage the
    <lb/>road was very rough, rocky &amp; stony. From
    <lb/>thence to <placeName key="conne">connalds Ville</placeName> a small
    <lb/>town on the <placeName key="yough">Yoxhiogeny</placeName>, 14 miles. The
    <lb/>most of this stage was poor, and mount-
    <lb/>ainous, and but thinly settled except
    <lb/>within 3 or 4 miles of the river after
    <lb/>we left the <placeName key="cheri">chesnut ridge</placeName>. We all took
    <lb/>notice when on the <placeName key="allmo">Alleganies</placeName>, and for
    <lb/>many miles on this side how very back-
    <lb/>ward the trees were; when we left
    <lb/>home they were a puting out fast
    <lb/>and the weather being warm they
    <lb/>made rapid progress; yet this morn-
    <lb/>ing we remarked the but of the
    <lb/>whiteoak and chesnut were not
    <lb/>formed into leaves so as to make an
    <lb/>appearace, yet the same day as we decend
    <lb/>ed from the chesnut ridge the trees
    <lb/><pb n="19" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_019"/>
    <lb/>were all green, the sight was curious
    <lb/>and different from our last prospect
    <lb/>that I measured some chesnut leaves
    <lb/>and found them to be 3 inches wide
    <lb/>and 6 long and sprouts of 8 or 9 inches
    <lb/>growth so that I think there is at
    <lb/>least in 3 miles riding two weeks dif-
    <lb/>ference in the seasons. When on the
    <lb/><placeName key="chehi">chesnut hill</placeName> there is one of the most
    <lb/>extensive prospects that is to be met with
    <lb/>in traveling to the North to the West and
    <lb/>to the South, I had no doubt but the
    <lb/>view was of 50 miles extent. In every
    <lb/>direction the view look an extensive plain
    <lb/>but where we came to traverse it we
    <lb/>found many large hills tho no mount-
    <lb/>ain neither is there any to the west-
    <lb/>ward in the United States equal to
    <lb/>those we have crossed. We lodged with

    <p>A pleasant day; went to my
    <lb/>kinsman <persName key="rcadw1">Reese Cadwallader’s</persName> near
    <lb/><placeName key="brown">Brown’s Ville</placeName> on <placeName key="monon">Monongahala</placeName>; we
    <lb/>crossed <placeName key="yough">Yoxhiogeny</placeName> in a boat, it was
    <lb/>about 6 feet deep and perhaps 150
    <lb/>yards wide. In about half a mile after
    <lb/>we crossed the river we passed by a
    <lb/>merchant mill erected on a very curious
    <lb/>seal, the stream was small but had
    <lb/>a natural perpendicular fall over a
    <lb/>broad rock (which lay horizontal)
    <lb/>of 28 feet, the Mill was erected
    <lb/>close to this rock which formed a
    <lb/>level yard to the upper door;
    <lb/>under said rock was a cavity or hol-
    <lb/>low place 12 feet high, and nearly
    <lb/>as far back, which ran all across
    <lb/>the stream, over which the water
    <lb/>beautifully descended. From
    <lb/><pb n="21" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_021"/>
    <lb/>thence to <placeName key="monong">Monongahala</placeName>, a continual
    <lb/>succession of high hills and low vales, tho’
    <lb/>very little bottom land, fit for meadow.
    <lb/>The land is pretty clear of stones, the soil
    <lb/>in general good and thick settled, yet
    <lb/>some of the fields that had been a good
    <lb/>while under culture, looked poor. I
    <lb/>saw several fields of good wheat but more
    <lb/>that were light. 20 miles.

    <p>Went 12 miles this morning to see
    <lb/>my cousin <persName key="bchar1">Benjamin Sharples</persName>, he
    <lb/>lives on the west branch of 10 mile creek
    <lb/>near <placeName key="checkplace">Green Furnace</placeName>. I crossed the
    <lb/><placeName key="monong">Monongahala</placeName> at Bridgeport, a village
    <lb/>containing near 50 houses, the place
    <lb/>whereon the town stands was four year’s
    <lb/>ago a fine meadow. The river is a beauti-
    <lb/>ful stream, flow’s along with a gentle cur
    <lb/>rent, is 340 yards wide and 10 or 12 feet
    <lb/>deep, it has very high banks, yet last
    <lb/><pb n="22" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_022"/>
    <lb/>fall they were overflown. The river
    <lb/>as I was informed rose 42 feet per-
    <lb/>pendicular. The people here were
    <lb/>very busy, building flat bottomed
    <lb/>boats. They are made out of green
    <lb/>timber, about 12 feet wide, and from
    <lb/>20 to 30 feet long, boarded upon each
    <lb/>side, 5 or 6 feet high, and roofed over
    <lb/>more than half way. I was informed
    <lb/>many boats of this kind were built on
    <lb/>this river and its neighbouring waters,
    <lb/>they are sold at the rate of 11/3 per
    <lb/>foot, for every foot they are in length,
    <lb/>to people who come with families to
    <lb/>these waters, to take their departure
    <lb/>westward and southwest, to new
    <lb/>countries. They put on board, horses,
    <lb/>waggon, farming Utensils, cow
    <lb/>kind, household furniture &amp; c. and
    <lb/>so great is the spirit of emigration
    <lb/><pb n="23" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_023"/>
    <lb/>down the waters of the <placeName key="ohior">Ohio</placeName> to dif-
    <lb/>ferent place, that, we were inform-
    <lb/>ed when at <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName>, by a very reputa-
    <lb/>ble character that for 30 days past
    <lb/>upon an average, he thought there had
    <lb/>been from 11 to 12 of these boats contain
    <lb/>ing from 20 to 50 persons, so loaded,
    <lb/>passing by that town each day. They
    <lb/>gently move down with the current,
    <lb/>and when they come to the mouths
    <lb/>of the <placeName key="checkplace">Sciota</placeName> and other rivers, their
    <lb/>boats are of no further use; for their
    <lb/>construction is such they cannot be
    <lb/>taken up the stream, and are therefore
    <lb/>often sold for a trifle, or turned a drift.
    <lb/>I went up the west side of the river,
    <lb/>and in about 6 miles passed through
    <lb/>a small village called <placeName key="frede">Frederick’s
    <lb/>town</placeName>, then up the river to 10 mile
    <lb/>creek; I passed over some very rich
    <lb/><pb n="24" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_024"/>
    <lb/>bottoms on said river and creek;
    <lb/>also hills sides very good, abounding
    <lb/>with black and white walnut, locust;
    <lb/>sugar maple &amp; c. As far as I have
    <lb/>seen, if it were not for the hills,
    <lb/>this would be a desirable country,
    <lb/>but they will ever be in the way
    <lb/>of farming, and conveying produce
    <lb/>to market, but its vicinity with water
    <lb/>carriage will very much facilitate the
    <lb/>later. Their best meadows are
    <lb/>often on the tops of high hills, which
    <lb/>are inclinable to be wet and springy.
    <lb/>The land is to grass, yet clover is
    <lb/>not much propagated. The price
    <lb/>of produce pretty good, wheat 7/6,
    <lb/>rye 4/6, corn 3/9, oats 3/9, butter
    <lb/>from 1/ to ⅓, cheese 9 d, home made
    <lb/>sugar from 1/ to ¼, of which with
    <lb/>industry and care the country may
    <lb/><pb n="25" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_025"/>
    <lb/>always be supplyed 24 miles.

    <p>Set off early this morning, stopped
    <lb/>at <persName key="checkplace">Parker’s</persName> fed our horses, and got
    <lb/>our breakfast. A number of curi-

    <lb/>in this last stage. At a certain depth
    <lb/><pb n="26" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_026"/>
    <lb/>much of this country appears to be
    <lb/>covered with broad rocks lying hori-
    <lb/>zontally, which about streams are
    <lb/>washed bare. Over the edges of these
    <lb/>rocks the water often falls from 2 to 12
    <lb/>or 15 feet, I many places the rock is
    <lb/>hollow, so that there are large
    <lb/>cavities under where the water falls
    <lb/>quite dry. From hence to <placeName key="pitts">Pitts-

    <lb/>is all the way a continual succession

    <lb/>the way settled tho’ thirily.
   </p><p>Some fields of wheat and rye locked
    <lb/>very well yet many others were
    <lb/>poor. Was generally heavy loaded
    <lb/><pb n="27" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_027"/>
    <lb/>with timber, the greatest body of
    <lb/>which was whiteoak, some sugar
    <lb/>maple along the low ground, yet the
    <lb/>further towards <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName> the scarc-
    <lb/>er. I have seen next to no pine
    <lb/>since I came over the mountains;
    <lb/>Some chesnut in places, but rails
    <lb/>are mostly made of white oak, as are
    <lb/>their houses. We had very little
    <lb/>prospect of Pittsburg untill we
    <lb/>arrived nearly. The town stands
    <lb/>on a beautiful plain surrounded by
    <lb/>very high hills, just above the junc
    <lb/>tion of the <placeName key="alleg">Allegany</placeName> and <placeName key="monong">Mononga
    <lb/>hala rivers</placeName> which rivers when uni
    <lb/>ted make the <placeName key="ohior">Ohio</placeName>. We descended
    <lb/>a very steep hill or mountain to the
    <lb/><placeName key="monong">Monongahala</placeName>, to appearance not fit
    <lb/>for any waggon to go up or down, tho’
    <lb/>they often do. The river flows gently
    <lb/><pb n="28" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_028"/>
    <lb/>along at the foot of this mountain,
    <lb/>where we crossed it, being half a
    <lb/>mile wide and 10 or 12 feet deep.
    <lb/>This river is most in view from
    <lb/>the town, and the greatest place of
    <lb/>trading. The street next to said river
    <lb/>is beautifully situated, being level, 50
    <lb/>or 60 feet wide, and elivated perhaps
    <lb/>50 feet above the water; there are
    <lb/>places for a waggon to go down, and
    <lb/>a fine gravelly margin to drive on.
    <lb/>The town when we were there was
    <lb/>a place of great concourse, Abundance
    <lb/>of people take their departure from
    <lb/>hence to various parts of the western,
    <lb/>and south western territories, up the
    <lb/>big beaver, the <placeName key="alleg">allegany river</placeName>, <placeName key="french">french

    <lb/>when we arrived here, and we had
    <lb/><pb n="29" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_029"/>
    <lb/>some fears least we should not get
    <lb/>accommodations for ourselves and horses but
    <lb/>having before we crossed the river enquired
    <lb/>for the best tavern, we were recommend
    <lb/>ed to the greentree near the river; where,
    <lb/>upon our arrival, after some hesitation,
    <lb/>we were taken in; where we found good
    <lb/>accommondations. Some discourage-
    <lb/>ments attended my mind on my way
    <lb/>thither, concerning the buisness we were
    <lb/>going on, it being in itself important, to
    <lb/>be transacted among a people of a strange
    <lb/>language, in an unknown and wilderness
    <lb/>country, and a great uncertainty how we
    <lb/>should be able to get the goods we have
    <lb/>in care to the descred port; But upon
    <lb/>our arrival here, and being introduced
    <lb/>to some for whom we had letters of credit,
    <lb/>we met with a very kind reception,
    <lb/>and they appeared hearty in assisting
    <lb/><pb n="30" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_030"/>
    <lb/>us, and informed, that the goods sent from
    <lb/><placeName key="phila">Philadelphia</placeName> were safely arrived a few
    <lb/>days ago, and were in the public store.
    <lb/>The deputy quarter master informed
    <lb/>us, that he would send them up to
    <lb/><placeName key="cornp">Cornplanter’s Village</placeName>, which was at
    <lb/>least 140 miles by land, and abun
    <lb/>dantly more by water, that it was a
    <lb/>very lucky time for them to go, the
    <lb/>river being neither too low nor too
    <lb/>high, so that the prospect of things
    <lb/>looked a little more lightsome.

    <lb/>to convey those we had procured indif

    <lb/>We then crossed the <placeName key="alleg">Allegany

    <lb/>the fort, it was a clear beautiful
    <lb/>stream, about 50 perches wide,

    <lb/>and 6 feet deep, has much more of a

    <lb/>ed a wilderness country but little in
    <lb/>habited the settlement not more than
    <lb/>two or three years old, and scarce of
    <lb/>provision for man and horse. For a
    <lb/>few miles after we crossed the river
    <lb/>the land was very good, but in the
    <lb/>general it fell short of the idea I enter
    <lb/>tained of it. In this days ride the
    <lb/>land was generally hilly, tho’ not with
    <lb/>such sharp pitches as about <placeName key="redst">Redstone</placeName>.
    <lb/>As we advanced northward, the hills
    <lb/>decreased; In places thinly timbered,

    <lb/>whiteoak the most general timber, in

    <lb/>a little oats with us, after feeding
    <lb/>them we tied them to stakes &amp; c. till

    <lb/>some of our own victuals we wrap-
    <lb/>ped ourselves in our blankets and

    <p>We were stirring by times this morn-
    <lb/>ing as our bed was not inviting to
    <lb/>indulge nature, and 7 ½ miles we
    <lb/>came to a poor cabin; here we got some
    <lb/>oats for our horses and let them pick
    <lb/>a little in the woods; But we found
    <lb/>a great change since we left. <placeName key="redst">Red-

    <lb/>backwarder, the leaves are but just put
    <lb/>ting out and there is next to no picking
    <lb/>of any, kind in the woods that it looks
    <lb/>likely our horses will very much
    <lb/>suffer; when we get among the Indians
    <lb/>if not before. We took breakfast of our
    <lb/>own provision and then proceeded on
    <lb/>12 miles further where after feeding
    <lb/>our horses we took dinner in like man
    <lb/>ner and got to <placeName key="ffran">Fort Franklin</placeName> before
    <lb/>4 O Clock, 14 ½ miles pretty much fa-
    <lb/>tigued, part of our road being tedious
    <lb/>and rough, and we sensibly felt
    <lb/>the effects of our poor nights rest.
    <lb/>We met with but few houses in this day’s
    <lb/>ride the country has been pretty lev-

    <p>This morning we breakfasted with the
    <lb/>Captain agreeably to his request and
    <lb/>got of him four bushels of corn, half a b of
    <lb/>flour and two quarts of salt. The corn
    <lb/>to feed our horses with through the wilder-
    <lb/>ness, and the flour &amp; c. to take to the In-

    <lb/>a the tavern where we put up last e-
    <lb/>vening we took our departure being will-

    <lb/>for each of our horses at very coarse hay 15/a

    <lb/>pay as high as 15/a bushel for oats.
    <lb/>We crossed <placeName key="french">French Creek</placeName> close by the

    <lb/>We had stones with a very rough
    <lb/>country for a while, in places very
    <lb/>poor; in about 12 miles we crossed
    <lb/>a rich bottom in a small stream, here
    <lb/>was plenty of pasture, being the first
    <lb/>we had seen since we left home in the
    <lb/>woods. From thence to <placeName key="checkplace">Oyk creek</placeName> through

    <lb/>our horses with some corn we turned them
    <lb/>for the first time into the open woods, these
    <lb/>being plenty of grass and other luminant
    <lb/>growths. This is the most desireable place

    <lb/>Here the <orgName key="hollco">Holland company</orgName> is erect-
    <lb/>ing a grist mill, a Saw mill being
    <lb/>already put up, tho’ there are but
    <lb/>few houses within 20 miles. We have
    <lb/>had a cut road <del>ent</del> ever since we
    <lb/>left <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName> to this place, which now
    <lb/>ending we entered the wilderness
    <lb/>without any path; a number of
    <lb/>trees being marked last fall, they
    <lb/>were now to be our guide; It was
    <lb/>a thick wood we had to pass through with
    <lb/>a great quantity of brush and young
    <lb/>stuff in the way. Our journey this
    <lb/>day was truly wild and romantic
    <lb/>having a continual succession of logs
    <lb/>to cross sometimes three in a perch di
    <lb/>vers of which we had to jump our horse
    <lb/>is over and with difficulty got round
    <lb/>others: in places such a jumble of
    <lb/>stones or rocks that we were in continual
    <lb/><pb n="45" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_045"/>
    <lb/>danger of getting our horses legs fast, or
    <lb/>broken in the cavities between the stones
    <lb/>presently we would have to descend lascks
    <lb/>almost perpendicular into swamps and
    <lb/>then out again as difficult; and these
    <lb/>guts were very frequent. The roots of
    <lb/>the pine and hemlock trees were very
    <lb/>troublesome, the ground in many places
    <lb/>being laced over with them in a rough con-
    <lb/>dition. The under brush and limbs of
    <lb/>the trees were another very great difficulty
    <lb/>as were some very steep hills in the lat-
    <lb/>ter past of this stage. It is called 240
    <lb/>miles which we thought were very long
    <lb/>ones, for it took us 12 hours industrious trav-
    <lb/>elling, including about an hour we
    <lb/>turned our horses out to pick a little a
    <lb/>grass tho’ next to none was to be seen in
    <lb/>this day’s ride, nor one house for 20 miles.
    <lb/>The land was heavy timbered, but not
    <lb/><pb n="46" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_046"/>
    <lb/>a kindly soil, and I think will not
    <lb/>be settled for many years to come.
    <lb/>Many natural curiosities present-
    <lb/>ed, one of which, was the large quanti
    <lb/>tie of green moss that covered all the
    <lb/>rocks the stones the old logs and the
    <lb/>whole surficee of the ground, under
    <lb/>the thick forest of the pine trees.
    <lb/>I thought the coat of moss for thickness
    <lb/>and length, resembled a fleece of
    <lb/>wool. Some large rocks 12 or more feet
    <lb/>high thus shielded over and receiv
    <lb/>ing seed from the neighbouring trees
    <lb/>which seed having sprouted took root
    <lb/>and grew to be large trees of 2 or 3 feet over
    <lb/>3 or 4 such trees. I have seen on one rock
    <lb/>and their roots have spread down
    <lb/>its sides 10 or more feet until they
    <lb/>have joined the ground and grown
    <lb/>firm therein, so that the sides of the
    <lb/><pb n="47" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_047"/>
    <lb/>rocks were bound with them like so many
    <lb/>large ropes. We arrived on <placeName key="broke">broken straw</placeName>
    <lb/>in the evening where we found plenty
    <lb/>of pasture for our horses, and a cabin
    <lb/>that was erected last summer the owners
    <lb/>of which kindly let us have quarters and
    <lb/>directed where the best pasture on the
    <lb/>creek was to turn our horses to. We had
    <lb/>provision with us which after partak-
    <lb/>ing of, we spread ourselves on the floor
    <lb/>to take some rest which we found small
    <lb/>enough for us and the family. The
    <lb/>night being cold and the cabin open
    <lb/>we had often to rise to mend our fire.

    <lb/>vegetation and loaded with lofty
    <lb/>pines, sugar trees, white walnut, button
    <lb/>wood &amp; c. Here we saw several sugar
    <lb/>camps erected by the Indians wher
    <lb/>they come in the season to make su
    <lb/>gar, tho more than 20 miles from

    <lb/>causes, so that they with great facility
    <lb/>convey their kettles &amp; c. for making
    <lb/>sugar down the river and up this
    <lb/>creek. We passed by two or more cabins
    <lb/>of white people as we went down this
    <lb/>creek but saw none after we turned up
    <lb/>the river to the mouth of <placeName key="concr">Conowongo</placeName>
    <lb/>where we arrived about noon; it is
    <lb/>called 18 miles from this place to <placeName key="cornp">Corn

    <lb/>of pasture for our horses and a good house
    <lb/>to quarter in tho’ we had to find our own
    <lb/>provision and sleep on the floor. Near
    <lb/>the mouth of this creek on a beautiful dry
    <lb/>plain there is a town laid out by the state
    <lb/>of <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> it is called <placeName key="warre">Warrentown</placeName>,
    <lb/>the <orgName key="hollco">Holland company</orgName> owns a large body
    <lb/>of land adjoining this place which they
    <lb/>are a surveying into townships and settling.
    <lb/>They have built a good house on a lot in

    <lb/>were drunk having obtaind liquor of some sett-

    <lb/><persName key="jjohn1">Joseph Johnson</persName> immediately put a stop

    <lb/>from the use of distilled spirits in their
    <lb/>surveying buisness last summer as it
    <lb/>was the practice of other surveyors in the
    <lb/>Holland employ, and found they were
    <lb/>better without it. He agreed with a young
    <lb/>man who was sober and we were in-

    <p>A pleasant day set off with our Indian
    <lb/>guide who could not talk english nor
    <lb/>understand any that we know of, in less
    <lb/>than 2 miles we crossed the <placeName key="concr">Conowongo</placeName> a
    <lb/>beautiful stream which flowed along
    <lb/>with a gentle current. We thought it
    <lb/><pb n="51" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_051"/>
    <lb/>was nearly as large as <placeName key="french">French creek</placeName>.
    <lb/>For about two miles after we crossed this water
    <lb/>the land was good, but from thence to the
    <lb/><placeName key="alleg">Allegany river</placeName> perhaps 8 miles we had a rough
    <lb/>mountainous country and I think much of
    <lb/>it poor thin soil with a numbe of steep hills
    <lb/>to ascend and desend, our road was better
    <lb/>calculated for and Indian path than for
    <lb/>travelling on horseback; there was a great
    <lb/>abundance of windfell timber to cross we
    <lb/>throught on an average one or more for ev-
    <lb/>ery two perch some we could get round and
    <lb/>some others we jumped our horses over.
   </p><p>When we arrived on the river we stopped
    <lb/>a hile to let our horses eat grass there being
    <lb/>a great plenty on some of its bottoms which
    <lb/>was a pleasing sight and had a ten-
    <lb/>dency to remove some f<del>r</del>ears which atten-
    <lb/>ded when in the naked woods where no

    <lb/>after their hard journey when we got
    <lb/>among the Indians must suffer for
    <lb/>want of provision While here a number
    <lb/>of Indians came by in canoes who
    <lb/>stopped to see us shook hands with
    <lb/>us and looked pleasant. One man came
    <lb/>down from the mountain to us with a
    <lb/>large Turkey on his back which he had just
    <lb/>shot, we thought it would have weighed
    <lb/>more than 20 lb. The sight of this con-
    <lb/>veyed an idea that small game was plen-
    <lb/>ty amongst them, and it was likely <del>tho</del>
    <lb/>we should come in for shares; one
    <lb/>of the canoes also had a quantity of fine
    <lb/>fish in it, but we found, when amongst
    <lb/>them that a Turkey was seldom taken
    <lb/>or any other small game, and it is rare
    <lb/>to see a squirrel in the wilderness: we saw
    <lb/>some pleasants but no partuges. After
    <lb/>a short conference on the weighty buisness
    <lb/><pb n="53" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_053"/>
    <lb/>we were embarked in, we proceeded up the
    <lb/>river not without some exercise of mind
    <lb/>and would have been glad we could
    <lb/>have sent a messenger forward to have
    <lb/><del>to have</del> informed, the chiefs of our com
    <lb/>ing, but this was out of our power, for
    <lb/>none of the Indians we had met with
    <lb/>could talk english; we therefore moved
    <lb/>forward with our minds attentive to best
    <lb/>directions. When we came in sight of
    <lb/>the town many Indians appeared in
    <lb/>view, looking toward us. our guide turned
    <lb/>into the first cabin he came to and would
    <lb/><del>not</del> go no further but pointed to <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName>
    <lb/>house. We paid him one dollar and
    <lb/>moved forward. We presently saw the
    <lb/>chief, with a number of other Indians
    <lb/>coming towards us, upon our riding up to them
    <lb/>and alighting they appeared to welcome us
    <lb/>with open countenances. We did not
    <lb/><pb n="54" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_054"/>
    <lb/>know <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> nor could we distin-
    <lb/>guish him by his dress, but upon
    <lb/>shaking hands with <del>ber</del>one that stood
    <lb/>foremost, we asked if he was Cornplanter.
    <lb/>He informed us in his way that he
    <lb/>was. After shaking hands with
    <lb/>them all round, we were conducted
    <lb/>to his house which was not distinguish
    <lb/>from the rest, only by being larger.
    <lb/>After unsaddling our horses and
    <lb/>carrying in our baggage, being sea-
    <lb/>ted, Cornplanter his son <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName> <del>being</del>
    <lb/>and several others came in and sat
    <lb/>down. The chief presently asked
    <lb/>us, if we would like to see his
    <lb/>people in general council. We let
    <lb/>him know we would, as soon as it
    <lb/>was convenient. Tomorrow at 10 OClock
    <lb/>was therefore fixed on, and runners
    <lb/>dispached immediately to give notice.

    <lb/>here and sometime after the above conference
    <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> came into our appartment
    <lb/>and asked if we could eat in the Indian
    <lb/>way, we informed him, we expected we could,
    <lb/>he presently brought in some dinner in a
    <lb/>bark bowl and a tin kettle, the bowl
    <lb/>was placed beside us on the seat, and the
    <lb/>kettle on the ground before us; and we
    <lb/>were invited to eat; we saw the bowl and
    <lb/>the kettle but what was in either of them
    <lb/>we knew not ,or whe<del>a</del>ther they w<del>h</del>ere to be
    <lb/>eaten together or separate; the bowl contained
    <lb/>a number of round lumps of something tied
    <lb/>in Cornhusks; two dumplins were tied in
    <lb/>one set of husks with a string at each end
    <lb/>and in the middle. We let them know
    <lb/>our ignorance was such that we did not know
    <lb/>how to begin, which set some of the yonger
    <lb/>sort a laughing, but the chief took out his
    <lb/><pb n="56" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_056"/>
    <lb/>knife for they had set neither knifes,
    <lb/>forks, nor spoons, and taking up the
    <lb/>dumlins he cut one of them in two, then
    <lb/>stripping up the cornhusks he cut off a
    <lb/>piece of the dumplin and dipped it in the
    <lb/>kettle which we found contained bean
    <lb/>oyl and eat it; we followed the example
    <lb/>and made a light meal; the bean oil
    <lb/>was cold and not gr<del>e</del>ateful to our palates,
    <lb/>but we have since seen, this was of

    <lb/>phia</placeName>, enterpreted for us; for his father
    <lb/>can neither speak nor understand english;
    <lb/>Henry was our enterpreter on all occasions
    <lb/>whilst among them, he was not very ready
    <lb/>and we believe the business we went on
    <lb/>suffered for want of one better qualify’d.
    <lb/>About 12 OClock between 30 and 40 of
    <lb/>their principal men met in council which
    <lb/>council Cornplanter opened by a short
    <lb/>speech expressing his satisfaction on seeing
    <lb/><pb n="58" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_058"/>
    <lb/>us coming riding through the bushes and
    <lb/>that it was the good spirit which preserved
    <lb/>us in our long journey for which they were
    <lb/>very glad. He then informed us of their
    <lb/>poverty the poorness of their houses which
    <lb/>were covered with bark and their inability
    <lb/>to make good ones. We thought the
    <lb/>latter part of this speech was calculated
    <lb/>to draw our charity. He then let us know
    <lb/>they were all met who were likely to
    <lb/>attend, that the women could not come
    <lb/>but the men would let them know what
    <lb/>we said to them we having particularly
    <lb/>requested their women might attend. We
    <lb/>then opened our minds to them by letting
    <lb/>them know the love their old friends
    <lb/>the Quakers have for them, and our
    <lb/>willingness to take a long journey to
    <lb/>see them some of us having left loving wives
    <lb/>and tender children with comfortable dwell
    <lb/><pb n="59" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_059"/>
    <lb/>lings, and exposed ourselves to the hardships
    <lb/>and difficulties of a perilous journey, with no other
    <lb/>view than for their improvement. We then
    <lb/>read the epistle or instrument of writing the
    <lb/>committee sent which particularly opened
    <lb/>the design and cause of our coming among
    <lb/>them. It was read by paragraphs and
    <lb/>intrepreted with some dificulty: We next
    <lb/>read <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkingson’s</persName> letter then dropt
    <lb/>some advice wishing them when they took
    <lb/>our proposals into considerations, they would
    <lb/>guard agains discouragements that might present
    <lb/>in their looking forward towards a change
    <lb/>in their manner of living, for we did not
    <lb/>doubt but their might be many difficulties
    <lb/>in their way and their progress might be
    <lb/>slow yet there are accounts in writings
    <lb/>amongst the white people of a people that
    <lb/>lived beyond the great waters, in another
    <lb/>island who many years ago lived like
    <lb/>they
    <lb/><pb n="60" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_060"/>
    <lb/>they do now yet were by industry and
    <lb/>care become very good farmers and mecan-
    <lb/>icks of all kinds and from that people
    <lb/>many of those fine leggons with the
    <lb/>other striped and nice cloathing they had
    <lb/>on came. We then let them know we
    <lb/>had a boat coming up the <placeName key="alleg">Allegany
    <lb/>river</placeName> with various kinds of goods among
    <lb/>which were a number of plough irons hoes
    <lb/>axes shovels and spades, with carpenters tools
    <lb/>which we intended never to take away but
    <lb/>leave among them but while our young
    <lb/>men staid they should should be placed
    <lb/>under their care to lend out to them.
    <lb/>as they wanted and when done to be
    <lb/>returned. Upon letting them know
    <lb/>we had nothing more to say amongst
    <lb/>them at this time they informed
    <lb/>us they would take our proposals
    <lb/>into consideration and give us an
    <lb/>answer
    <lb/><pb n="61" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_061"/>
    <lb/>answer to-morrow.

    <p>The indians were this day in
    <lb/>council on the business we laid before them
    <lb/>they divers sent their deputies for
    <lb/>us to explain some parts of the business we
    <lb/>had opened to them; One of their questions
    <lb/>was how they should draw their plows sing
    <lb/>they had no oxen to draw them with
    <lb/>we let them know we had seen two hor-
    <lb/>ses running about their town, and that was
    <lb/>enough to draw one plough, and if they
    <lb/>would save some of the mony they were to
    <lb/>get of the white people they might buy a
    <lb/>pair of oxen. and they would draw another
    <lb/>plough; and that our young men would
    <lb/>lend them their horses sometimes that we
    <lb/>did not expect any great matters at first
    <lb/>and that these would do to make a
    <lb/>beginning. With this answer they
    <lb/>appeared to be pretty well satisfyed
    <lb/><pb n="62" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_062"/>
    <lb/>tho we thought it was very evident it
    <lb/>was not such a one as the question
    <lb/>was artfully calculated for;
    <lb/>At another time they told us we must
    <lb/>wait with patience for an answer for
    <lb/>it was a great thing and they were all
    <lb/>consulting about it in their houses.
    <lb/>About five oclock they informed us they
    <lb/>were nearly ready to give us an answer
    <lb/>and wished to know if it would suit us
    <lb/>this evening we let them know we were
    <lb/>waiting their time, but as the day was
    <lb/>far spent, left it to them to judge
    <lb/>weather this evening would be sutable.
    <lb/>About six, 30 of them met us the opportu-
    <lb/>nity I thought was owned, a degree of
    <lb/>solemnity attending. After a short pa-
    <lb/>use <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> opened the council
    <lb/>the following being the substance of
    <lb/>his speech.
    <lb/>Brothers
    <lb/><pb n="63" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_063"/>
    </p>
    <floatingText type="speech"><body><p>Brothers the Quakers
    <lb/>Listen now to what
    <lb/>I am going to say to you. You know brothers
    <lb/>the read people are poor, the great spirit has
    <lb/>made them of another language, so that it is
    <lb/>very hard for us to understand one another
    <lb/>plainly, as their is no person here that can
    <lb/>interpret very well. Brothers, we take
    <lb/>great pains to settle the proposals you made to
    <lb/>us but we differ in opinion, and we must take
    <lb/>great pains to have everything complete.
   </p><p>Brothers. we suppose the reason you came here
    <lb/>was to help poor Indians some way or other, and
    <lb/>you wish the chiefs to tell their warriers not to go
    <lb/>on so bad as they have done; and you wish us
    <lb/>to take up work like the white people now
    <lb/>brothers, some of your sober men will take up wo-
    <lb/>rk, and do as you say. and if they do well,
    <lb/>then will your young men stay longer, but some
    <lb/>others will not mind what you say.
    <lb/><pb n="64" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_064"/>
    <lb/>Brothers, We cant say a work against
    <lb/>you it is the best way to call quakers broth-
    <lb/>ers you never wished our lands you never
    <lb/>wished any part of our lands therefore
    <lb/>we are determined to try to learn your
    <lb/>ways and those young men may stay here
    <lb/>two years to try by that time we shall know
    <lb/>whether <persName key="rmorr1">Morris</persName> will leave us any land
    <lb/>for last summer we sold our land and
    <lb/>we dont know yet whether we shall get
    <lb/>what we reserved or whether we shall get
    <lb/>our money but by that time we shall know
    <lb/>now and then if they like it and we like
    <lb/>it your young men may stay longer.
   </p><p>Brothers. If your young men stay
    <lb/>here we want them to learn our children
    <lb/>to read and write.
   </p><p>Brothers. Two of you are going home
    <lb/>again, if they hear any thing about our
    <lb/>land. or our mony they must write to
    <lb/><pb n="65" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_065"/>
    <lb/>these young men here, and they must tell
    <lb/>us if we are like to be cheated.
   </p><p>Brothers. This is all I have got to say.
   </p></body></floatingText>
    <p>We expressed our satisfaction with their an-
    <lb/>swer and let them know our young men wo
    <lb/>uld want a house to live in, and a piece of
    <lb/>good land to work, that so they may be able
    <lb/>to raise their bread, for which purpose
    <lb/>we desired some of their chiefs would go with
    <lb/>us. to look about their country. and conclude
    <lb/>where would be most advantageous to the na-
    <lb/>tion for our young men to settle, and that we
    <lb/>wished to see their nation in general council
    <lb/>once more before we left them. Upon
    <lb/>our letting them know we had no more to
    <lb/>say. <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> desired his people would
    <lb/>all come and shake hands with us he him-
    <lb/>self first setting the example.

    <p>We had some
    <lb/>conversation this morning about sitting together
    <lb/><pb n="66" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_066"/>
    <lb/>in religious retirement and thought it would
    <lb/>be right to inform <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>. that if he
    <lb/>or any of his sober people; inclined to set
    <lb/>with us it would be acceptable, tho the pros-
    <lb/>pect of such an undertaken felt weighty
    <lb/>before we were fully concluded, the chief
    <lb/>with his son Henry came into our apart-
    <lb/>ment, and said he hoped we would
    <lb/>not think hard at their not keeping the
    <lb/>first day as the white people do, for they
    <lb/>could neither read nor write that they
    <lb/>were poor and had to work on that
    <lb/>day. and that they were often out a
    <lb/>hunting and had to attend to their game
    <lb/>We let him know that about 10 OClock
    <lb/>we intended to sit dow together in still-
    <lb/>ness to wait on the great spirite and
    <lb/>if he or any of his sober people would
    <lb/>come and sit with us it would be acc-
    <lb/>eptable. Near the time appinted
    <lb/><pb n="67" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_067"/>
    <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> with several others came into
    <lb/>our apartment. he sat very still till the op-
    <lb/>portunity closed. The others sat still a wh-
    <lb/>ile and then withdrew. Our door being
    <lb/>open during the opportunity the indians as
    <lb/>they passed by looked at us but shewed no
    <lb/>lightness.

    <p>Got up soon this morning to bake some
    <lb/>bread that we might be in readiness by 7
    <lb/>o’clock. to go up the river about 10 miles with
    <lb/>some of the chiefs to see where it would be
    <lb/>most suitable to make a settlement
   </p><p>We found it a trying circumstance rightly
    <lb/>to judge what was best to do on the occasion
     <lb/><placeName key="cornp">Jenescatego</placeName>. the town where we now are
    <lb/>being the place of <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanters</persName> residence
    <lb/>is in the middle of a good spot of land in
    <lb/><placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName>. on the west side of <placeName key="alleg">Allegany
    <lb/>river</placeName> about five miles south of the <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>
    <lb/>line. The said tract is Cornplanters own
    <lb/><pb n="68" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_068"/>
    <lb/>own privat property containing including
    <lb/>two islands near 800 acres. On this, and
    <lb/>near it, most of the Indians under his
    <lb/>superintendency, live; which, with the
    <lb/>goodness of this land being a fine fer-
    <lb/>tile soil, was a weighty consideratio-
    <lb/>n of making this the place of settle-
    <lb/>ment, there are also a large number
    <lb/>of children here fit for schooling, so
    <lb/>that with much conveniency, a large
    <lb/>school might be made up, but to
    <lb/>balance these advantages we consider-
    <lb/>ed the land was private property, and
    <lb/>if we made improvements, such as bu-
    <lb/>ilding a house and barn, and clear-
    <lb/>ing land, when we left it they would
    <lb/>all belong to <persName key="cornp2">cornplanter</persName>, and not to
    <lb/>the nation, also, if the Indians were to
    <lb/>clear land and fence lots, they would
    <lb/>not belong to the nation.
    <lb/>This
    <lb/><pb n="69" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_069"/>
    <lb/>This consideration made us believe it would be
    <lb/>best to look elsewhere. The nation ons 42 squa-
    <lb/>re miles on this river, beginning at the <placeName key="penns">Pennsyl-
    <lb/>vania</placeName> line, the lines of the reservation are not
    <lb/>yet run.but we found the Idians have a choice
    <lb/>that it should lay on the river half a mile
    <lb/>wide on each side. About 9 miles from hen
    <lb/>ce up the river, latterly stood a town, called
    <lb/><placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>, the inhabitants of which vil-
    <lb/>lage, a few years since, mostly removed
    <lb/>here. About 10 miles furter up the river.
    <lb/>we understood a settlement had latterly
    <lb/>been made, and from the best information
    <lb/>we could get, we thought somewhere abou-
    <lb/>t the old town would be the most suit-
    <lb/>able place to fix on, it being about ha-
    <lb/>lf way between the upper settlement and
    <lb/>lower town, accordingly with considerable
    <lb/>exertion, about 9 o’clock, we got <persName key="cornp2">Cornplan-
    <lb/>ter</persName>, his son <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName>, and three other
    <lb/>Indians
    <lb/><pb n="70" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_070"/>
    <lb/>to embark with us five in a canoe, they
    <lb/>put us up the river with settling poles,
    <lb/>at the rate of three miles an hour,
    <lb/>in places the river was shallow and
    <lb/>ran rapid, and in other places from
    <lb/>two to six feet deep. We passed
    <lb/>by a number of Islands, some pretty
    <lb/>large, which appeared rich, were gro-
    <lb/>wn over with grass and other herbage
    <lb/>very luxuriant. The flats on each
    <lb/>side of the river appeared much of
    <lb/>the same quality, tho’ none of them
    <lb/>were wide. In about 6 miles we
    <lb/>came to <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName> sawmill, we
    <lb/>stopped at his request and view-
    <lb/>ed it, The mill is almost new, bu-
    <lb/>ilt on a small stream, which when
    <lb/>we were there was so small that
    <lb/>the mill could do but very little
    <lb/>work, and at the time of year the
    <lb/>stream
    <lb/><pb n="71" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_071"/>
    <lb/>stream is pretty full, the river is often so
    <lb/>high that it hurts the mill with its back
    <lb/>waters. In about three miles further
    <lb/>up the river, we came to the old town, three
    <lb/>or more families yet remain here, we thou-
    <lb/>ght there might be 180 acres of a flat that
    <lb/>has been mostly cleared and worked with
    <lb/>corn, part of which is grown up with haz-
    <lb/>els &amp; c; and part with grass that in a few
    <lb/>weeks would do to mow, and some of the
    <lb/>richest spots of it are put in with corn
    <lb/>this spring, it doth not appear to have
    <lb/>ever been fenced, and at certain freshes
    <lb/>is subject to an overflow. This tract lies
    <lb/>on the northwest side of the river; the
    <lb/>flat is about 40 perches wide, and then
    <lb/>commences timberland, mostly white
    <lb/>pine, suitable for building, or rail tim-
    <lb/>ber, which timberland, within 60 perc-
    <lb/>hes of the flat we thought pretty good;
    <lb/><pb n="72" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_072"/>
    <lb/>lies very well to the sun, with a gentle
    <lb/>ascent, and clear of stones, Upon viewing
    <lb/>this land, and taking its local situation
    <lb/>into consideration, we were united in
    <lb/>believing, that somewhere near this
    <lb/>place, would be best to make our
    <lb/>settlement; Upon informing two
    <lb/>of the chiefs, who bore us company,
    <lb/>that we thought across the upper
    <lb/>end of the cleared flat, from the river
    <lb/>back, taking in part of the woodl-
    <lb/>and would be suitable for our
    <lb/>purpose, and that if they liked
    <lb/>it to tell us and if they did
    <lb/>not like it tell us so, and we
    <lb/>would look farther where it
    <lb/>would suit them better;
   </p><p>They said they had informed
    <lb/>us all their land was before
    <lb/>us and that we might take it
    <lb/><pb n="73" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_073"/>
    <lb/>where we liked best, and expressed their
    <lb/>full satisfaction with our choice.
   </p><p><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> then said, this man meaning
    <lb/>one of the chiefs that was with us, lives in
    <lb/>this town, and he is like one of you a so-
    <lb/>ber man and drinks no whiskey, and he
    <lb/>is very glad the young men are coming to
    <lb/>live so near him. We informed the chi-
    <lb/>efs that our young men would want tim-
    <lb/>ber, to build a house, for rails and for
    <lb/>firewood to which they readily consented
    <lb/>saying, they would be very glad they
    <lb/>would cut all the trees down; and further
    <lb/>liberty they would give them, if they saw
    <lb/>a buck swimming across the river, or runn
    <lb/>ing through the woods they might sho-
    <lb/>ot him or if they saw any fish in the
    <lb/>river they might catch them.
   </p><p>We then returned down the river
    <lb/>with Cornplanter to his village.

    <p>This morning resumed the consider
    <lb/>ation of what further propositions we
    <lb/>should make to these people in ord-
    <lb/>er to their additional encouragement
    <lb/>in civilization and agriculture, and
    <lb/>mutually agreed on some; which
    <lb/>will be inserted in its proper pl-
    <lb/>ace. This afternoon <persName key="cornp2">Cornpla-

    <lb/>sorts of seed corn suitable for
    <lb/>this climate, divers kinds of beans
    <lb/>and garden seeds, such as water-
    <lb/>melons, pumpkins, cucumbers, &amp; c
    <lb/>with a quantity of potatoes to
    <lb/>plant, which he said had been
    <lb/>sent in from the different houses
    <lb/>as a blessing to begin with.
   </p><p>We thought the hearty good
    <lb/>will, with which these were pres-
    <lb/>ented manifested a full appro-

    <lb/>bation with <del>whic</del> our undertaking
    <lb/>There were more of each, except
    <lb/>potatoes, than we wanted to plant,
    <lb/>and upon informing him so, we
    <lb/>were answer’d that we might take
    <lb/>them all, for they were sent in
    <lb/>for that purpose.

    <p>We are now our own cooks, dish-washers

    <lb/>we brought with us from <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName> &amp;

    <lb/>us, early after our arrival, that
    <lb/>they were scarce of corn, occasioned as
    <lb/>he said by an uncommon over-
    <lb/>flow of the river, last spring, some
    <lb/>time after their corn was come up,
    <lb/>and by an early frost in the
    <lb/>fall. When enquiring for bacon
    <lb/>at Pittsburg to send up in the
    <lb/>boat, we were informed it was
    <lb/><pb n="76" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_076"/>
    <lb/>unnecessary to carry meat here
    <lb/>for there was a plenty in this
    <lb/>place, however we thought best
    <lb/>not to trust to an uncertainty,
    <lb/>and have therefore 120 lbs of bacon
    <lb/>coming up in the boat, upon
    <lb/>enquiring since we came here, we
    <lb/>find meat is not to be obtain’d.
    <lb/>About one pound of dryed meat
    <lb/>and four pounds of fresh, is all
    <lb/>we got of them, while amongst
    <lb/>them, so that the prospect of things
    <lb/>as to provision, looked a little gloomy

    <lb/>less than nine or ten days
    <lb/>from this date, but, upon <persName key="cornp2">Corn-

    <lb/>their corn, put their wood &amp; c. out of
    <lb/>this entry a door opens into each apart
    <lb/>ment, that assigned us is 30 feet long
    <lb/>the other 24, and each 16 feet wide;
    <lb/>they are built of round logs or poles,
    <lb/>let in close together, tho not chunked
    <lb/>or pla<del>n</del>ster’d, so that we found our
    <lb/>end pretty cold before morning upon
    <lb/>our informing the chief they had letter
    <lb/>make their houses tighter by plastering
    <lb/>up the cracks; he replied, if they made
    <lb/>their houses too warm, they would
    <lb/>not like to leave them when winter
    <lb/>came to go a hunting. Along
    <lb/>each side of these houses ran births
    <lb/>or seats, they are always ready; over these
    <lb/>births about five feet high are shelves of
    <lb/>the same width of the birth, which serve
    <lb/>to put their kitchen furniture, corn &amp; c.
    <lb/>upon; the fire is built on the ground
    <lb/><pb n="79" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_079"/>
    <lb/>in the middle of the house, that part
    <lb/>between the births not being floored;
    <lb/>there is a large hole left in the top of
    <lb/>the roof for the smoke to go out at, which
    <lb/>makes a pretty good window. As far
    <lb/>as I have observed, the above description
    <lb/>answers for most of their houses, tho’ they
    <lb/>are not so large, nor double, as this;
    <lb/>they are mostly from 12 to 15 feet square,
    <lb/>with a shed before the door; there are per-
    <lb/>haps 30 such houses in this village, a
    <lb/>number more down the river out of sight,
    <lb/>and some above; they are beautifully si-
    <lb/>tuated on the west-side of the river,
    <lb/>which is about 150 yards wide and glides
    <lb/>along by the Town with a gentle cur-
    <lb/>rent, the bank of the river is low; tho’
    <lb/>gradually ascends to their houses,
    <lb/>which are mostly within 6 or 7 perches
    <lb/>so that they may readily supply
    <lb/><pb n="80" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_080"/>
    <lb/>themselves with water, there being no
    <lb/>spring on the flat where the town stands,
    <lb/>which flat is sandy loam, easily tilled,
    <lb/>and if well managed would be very
    <lb/>productive; There are 50 or 60 Acres
    <lb/>of land adjoining the town, nearly clea-
    <lb/>red, the most of which is put in yearly
    <lb/>with corn, beans and potatoes.
   </p><p>The work is all done by the women with
    <lb/>hoes, they were very busy while we were there,
    <lb/>much of the land was grown up with grass
    <lb/>weeds &amp; c. they go round the old cornhills,
    <lb/>which were very high, as I have observed
    <lb/>it is the general practice to have a have
    <lb/>hill when finished, near one foot high,
    <lb/>and hoe the grass and weeds clean a-
    <lb/>way; then dig a hole where the hill
    <lb/>stood, and plant in the same place;
    <lb/>Sometime after the corn is come up,
    <lb/>they hoe all the face of the ground over,
    <lb/><pb n="81" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_081"/>
    <lb/>so that it looks very neatly, They
    <lb/>plant beans with their corn also,
    <lb/>a large quantity, for which they stick
    <lb/>poles. they also plant squashes
    <lb/>and pumpkins among their corn.
   </p><p>The women since we came here have
    <lb/>worked hardly, they pound all the
    <lb/>corn, for hominy and bread, sift and
    <lb/>pepare it; cut and split the wood &amp;
    <lb/>carry it home on their backs nearly a
    <lb/>quarter of a mile, make all their fires,
    <lb/>and all other kitchen busines; plant
    <lb/>and take care of their corn, and
    <lb/>gather it, when ready, plant their
    <lb/>beans and stick them, and as far
    <lb/>as I can learn, all other out door
    <lb/>work, except building their houses
    <lb/>and splitting rails that the corn
    <lb/>land is inclosed with. It has
    <lb/>been a busy time since we came
    <lb/>here
    <lb/><pb n="82" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_082"/>
    <lb/>here, the women have risen early;
    <lb/>gone out with their hoes to the corn-
    <lb/>field four or five <del>miles</del> in a company
    <lb/>some of whom were old greyheaded
    <lb/>women, and some girls of 8, 10 and 12
    <lb/>years of age, stuck pretty closely to
    <lb/>their work, return’d in the evening
    <lb/>weary, and go early to bed. One
    <lb/>old greyheaded woman I have seen
    <lb/>steadily on the move, she has had both
    <lb/>her feet so frozen, that she goes al-
    <lb/>together on her knees, I have seen
    <lb/>her carrying in wood and making the
    <lb/>fire, going to the river and brining up
    <lb/>water I have seen her take a hoe and go
    <lb/>40 perches out to the cornfield, return
    <lb/>in the evening with the labourers and
    <lb/>put her hoe by; and all this while
    <lb/>the men are spending their time
    <lb/>in idleness, such as shooting
    <lb/><pb n="83" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_083"/>
    <lb/>with their bows and arrows at a mark
    <lb/>(which is a very great recreation), pitch-
    <lb/>ing of quates, jumping, playing at
    <lb/>some kind of games, and on musical
    <lb/>instruments, and loitering about; so
    <lb/>that I have not while in this village
    <lb/>seen either man, or boy at any kind
    <lb/>of work. To see little girls, and old
    <lb/>women working hard with the hoe,
    <lb/>and boys of 12, 14 or 16 just by them
    <lb/>all day playing, looked hard, unnat-
    <lb/>ural, and to me very grievous. The
    <lb/>men at seasons go a hunting, and
    <lb/>at times a fishing, and they work the
    <lb/>canoe, at which, they are very handy;
    <lb/>There is very little game of any kind brought
    <lb/>in at this season of the year. I have seen
    <lb/>but one dear all the time we have been
    <lb/>among them, and I have seen no kind of
    <lb/>small game, except the turkey here
    <lb/><pb n="84" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_084"/>
    <lb/>heretofore mentioned; They catch a
    <lb/>few fish, yet, but little was done at it
    <lb/>while we were there, so that they live
    <lb/>poor, their chief subsistance at this
    <lb/>season, was corn, beans, and bear’s oil,
    <lb/>in different preparations, much of their
    <lb/>corn, and beans, were pounded into hominy
    <lb/>and boiled, this I thought was their chief
    <lb/>dependance; they also pound corn and
    <lb/>beans into flour, and make bread of it, they
    <lb/>also boil it in dumplins which they
    <lb/>eat with bears oil, by dipping it in, as
    <lb/>they do also their bread, they also put
    <lb/>sugar in their hominy, which eats very
    <lb/>well; but from my observation they eat
    <lb/>much less than we do, a small piece
    <lb/>of bread or dumpling dipped in the oil,
    <lb/>seem’d to satisfy nature, and thier sta-
    <lb/>ted meals, I thought, were not more than
    <lb/>two, a day, about 10 oClock A.M. &amp;
    <lb/><pb n="85" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_085"/>
    <lb/>P.M. If any of their friends came
    <lb/>to see them, the visit was not interupted
    <lb/>with cookery, or much cerimony in laying
    <lb/>the tables &amp; If their hominy was boiled,
    <lb/>(which was generally the case after 11 oClock
    <lb/>the day through) it was not material
    <lb/>whether cold or warm, the beiths before-
    <lb/>mentioned, always made ready a seat where-
    <lb/>upon they are presently engaged in smo-
    <lb/>king and talking; while thus busily em-
    <lb/>ployed, a kettle of hominy, with a large
    <lb/>wooded spoon, is brought and set down
    <lb/>on the ground before them; he who is most
    <lb/>handy to it lays by his pipe, and in a
    <lb/>few minutes appears to be satisfied
    <lb/>with his repast, and moves it on to the
    <lb/>next, while the rest of the company
    <lb/>is engaged as if no victuals was near
    <lb/>them; thus the kettle passes thro’ the com-
    <lb/>pany in a little time;
    <lb/>and
    <lb/><pb n="86" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_086"/>
    <lb/>and when done with, is hung up un-
    <lb/>till somebody else comes in. When they
    <lb/>have no hominy, the bread or dump-
    <lb/>lings go round in like manner.
    <lb/>In their clothing, their turn is for some-
    <lb/>thing tawdry; such a gay handkerchief
    <lb/>calico shirt, scarlet leggons, blue coat,
    <lb/>or petticoat, a belt of lively colours deco-
    <lb/>rated with beads tied round their mid-
    <lb/>dles, or knees, with long ends hanging
    <lb/>down; they are very fond of trinkets of
    <lb/>various kinds, in their noses and ears,
    <lb/>the men more particularly.
   </p><p>I have seen bobs of various kinds hang-
    <lb/>ing in their noses, in weight, an ounce
    <lb/>or more, coming down over their mouths.
    <lb/>The warriors have the rim of their
    <lb/>ears cut round, and loaded with
    <lb/>different kinds of toys, untill they
    <lb/>hang down several inches.
    <lb/><pb n="87" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_087"/>
    <lb/>I saw one man with two padlocks
    <lb/>in one ear, such as are used for
    <lb/>saddle-bags, another, with a watch,
    <lb/>such as children use; Large silver
    <lb/>crosses are also made use of. Their
    <lb/>calico shirts are short, and have ruf-
    <lb/>fles to their sleeves and bosoms.
   </p><p>The men’s, and women’s, are both made
    <lb/>in the same form, they come a little
    <lb/>lower than their hips, and hang
    <lb/>loose at the bottom, the women wear
    <lb/>their petticoats under them, which
    <lb/>are mostly made of a piece of blue
    <lb/>cloth, and wrapped tile round them,
    <lb/>coming down just below their knees,
    <lb/>with about 9 inches of the upper part of
    <lb/>the cloth turned down, on which they of-
    <lb/>ten stick red worsted binding.
   </p><p>But with all their tawdry dress, they
    <lb/>go dirty; I thought the women, more
    <lb/><pb n="88" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_088"/>
    <lb/>particularly, owing, perhaps in
    <lb/>some measure, to their working har-
    <lb/>der, and being more among the grease;
    <lb/>some of their shirts do not appear
    <lb/>to have been washed, ever, and about
    <lb/>their shoulders they become very black
    <lb/>and greasy, from their greasy heads;
    <lb/>their hair, I have observed to be the
    <lb/>cloth, to wipe their greasy fingers on
    <lb/>while they were eating their bread and
    <lb/>oil. Thus for want of a change
    <lb/>of clothes, living in their dirt,
    <lb/>they become very lousy, which they
    <lb/>try to extricate themselves from, by pul-
    <lb/>ling off their shifts, turning them in-
    <lb/>side, out, and hunting the vermin
    <lb/>with as much composure, and seeming-
    <lb/>ly, good grace, as a mother amongst us
    <lb/>would, in combing one of her chil-
    <lb/>dren; this part of their dirt, has
    <lb/><pb n="89" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_089"/>
    <lb/>not been one of the least of our trials,
    <lb/>neither have we any expectation, that we
    <lb/>shall leave them, without carrying away
    <lb/>some of their breeders.
   </p><p>For more than two weeks pass’d, the
    <lb/>weather has been very dry, and part of
    <lb/>the time a cold north wind; we had
    <lb/>frost for ten mornings successively; during
    <lb/>which time we slept in open cabins, in
    <lb/>our blankets, so that we sensibly felt the
    <lb/>want of more covering, and a better bed, be-
    <lb/>fore morning. For two or three days
    <lb/>the weather has been warm, with a
    <lb/>strong south wind; The woods have
    <lb/>been much on fire during this dry wea-
    <lb/>ther, clouds of smoke have frequently
    <lb/>covered us, so that the sun has been
    <lb/>hidden. A curious sight present-
    <lb/>ed two nights ago, of some neighbour-
    <lb/>ing hills, or rather mountains, that
    <lb/><pb n="90" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_090"/>
    <lb/>were on fire, perhaps they had not been
    <lb/>burnt for several years, and the great
    <lb/>quantity of dead timber, both standing
    <lb/>and laying down, having taken fire
    <lb/>as it pass’d along, made a very live-
    <lb/>ly appearance in the night, look-
    <lb/>ing as if the whole mountain was
    <lb/>on fire. We have been under some
    <lb/>exercise for a few days past concern-
    <lb/>ing our goods, which are coming up the
    <lb/>river, having very little cause to expect
    <lb/>their arrival before the last of this
    <lb/>month, and the dry weather been such
    <lb/>for a considerable time pass’d, the
    <lb/>river has fallen very fast, which the
    <lb/>Indians remarked to us, with some
    <lb/>degree of seriousness, telling us that it
    <lb/>would be, with some degree of difficulty
    <lb/>the boat would be brought up some
    <lb/>shallow places; But in the midst
    <lb/><pb n="91" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_091"/>
    <lb/>of our trials, we have still been favour’d,
    <lb/>a considerable quantity of rain
    <lb/>fell last evening; tho’ no difference
    <lb/>yet, appears in the river, there is
    <lb/>reason to hope it will rise.
   </p><p>We intended to have set off this morning
    <lb/>by 8 oClock for <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>, and agree’d
    <lb/>with <persName key="habee1">Henry Obeal</persName> last evening to go with
    <lb/>us, and be our interpreter.
   </p><p>It is now 11 oClock, yet neither he nor
    <lb/>any of his father’s family has gotten
    <lb/>his breakfast, tho’ we have been hurrying
    <lb/>him for two hours past.
   </p><p>About 12 oClock two of us set off on horse-
    <lb/>back, the other three having gone an
    <lb/>hour sooner with an Indian in a
    <lb/>canoe; we rode along the river one mile
    <lb/>above the Town, on the east side of it;
    <lb/>the first 3 or 4 miles were through an
    <lb/>open bottom, thinly timbered, and
    <lb/><pb n="92" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_092"/>
    <lb/>and good riding, then pass’d
    <lb/>thro’ thick timber, a large quan-
    <lb/>tity of which, was sugar maple,
    <lb/>thence thro’ a thick forest of hem-
    <lb/>lock and pine, very difficult to
    <lb/>pass; to the shore opposite the
    <lb/>place of destination; here again
    <lb/>we rode thro’ the river, tho’ wide &amp; deep.
    <lb/>We stopped at the house of a chief
    <lb/>who went with us to our intended set-
    <lb/>tlement, where we meet with our friends
    <lb/>which went in the canoe.
   </p><p>We viewed, an empty house that stood
    <lb/>near our settlement, but not liking it,
    <lb/>we proceeded to another, that was on
    <lb/>said settlement that was inhabited,
    <lb/>we understood the family proposed
    <lb/>leaving it, and would sell their right,
    <lb/>upon confering with the woman whom
    <lb/>we understood was the owner of the
    <lb/><pb n="93" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_093"/>
    <lb/>house, she was willing to part with it,
    <lb/>but having put in a few spots with
    <lb/>corn, and vines, (the whole not being more
    <lb/>than 3 or 4 Perches quare,) she appear-
    <lb/>ed unwilling to relinquish them, and
    <lb/>they were so in our way that we thought
    <lb/>better look elsewhere, for a settlement, but
    <lb/>upon the chief’s conferring with her, she
    <lb/>was willing to part with all the spots,
    <lb/>except one, which was not much in our
    <lb/>way, and as we understood she was a
    <lb/>sober woman, that would be likely to
    <lb/>make good use of her money, we paid
    <lb/>her 20 dollars for her house and, pri-
    <lb/>viledges, and with our assistance she
    <lb/>removed out;and in less, than an hour
    <lb/>we had possession; our young men
    <lb/>gave the house thorough cleaning,
    <lb/>and before dark we had our soanty
    <lb/>furniture arranged for house-keeping
    <lb/><pb n="94" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_094"/>
    <lb/>and having supped on our own, prepa-
    <lb/>rations, which admitted of but little change
    <lb/>we prepared for bed, in our open house
    <lb/>and naked walls; the Indian chief at
    <lb/>our request sent us three dear-skins with
    <lb/>the hair on, which we placed for our con-
    <lb/>venience, and retired, but before morning
    <lb/>we sensibly felt the want of a beter bed,
    <lb/>and more covering, the night being cold,
    <lb/>we were under the necessity of rising
    <lb/>several times to renew our fire.
   </p><p>Our house is about 20 feet long, and 14
    <lb/>wide, 6 feet high to the square; covered
    <lb/>with bark and a shed over the door, and
    <lb/>finished within as <del>Indian</del> other Indian
    <lb/>buildings mostly are, it stands on an
    <lb/>elevated spot, within five Perches of the
    <lb/>river on its north-west side, the soil
    <lb/>about said house, is of a light, sandy
    <lb/>quality, easily tilled; But further
    <lb/><pb n="95" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_095"/>
    <lb/>from the river is lower ground, which ap-
    <lb/>pears more fertile. Our horses since we
    <lb/>came among the Indians have run out,
    <lb/>at large, without any enclosure, they have got-
    <lb/>ten pretty plenty of coarse grass, in most
    <lb/>places we have been, and other herbages,
    <lb/>but here they get plenty of grass, and that
    <lb/>which is very good.

    <p>Our young men this morning plan-
    <lb/>ted some potatoes, and they are now
    <lb/>engaged in preparing ground for the
    <lb/>plough, having since we came up, bor-
    <lb/>rowed some tools of <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>.
    <lb/>This morning we had a present of fish, on
    <lb/>which we expect deliciously to dine.
    <lb/>our young men having prepared bobs
    <lb/>in order to try to cath some eels; this
    <lb/>evening set off up the river in a canoe,
    <lb/>but there being several rapids in the
    <lb/>river to ascend, which for want of
    <lb/>more
    <lb/><pb n="96" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_096"/>
    <lb/>more experience in working the vessels
    <lb/>they failed in their attempt to get
    <lb/>up one; the canoe turning across the
    <lb/>stream, presently turn’d bottom-up-
    <lb/>wards, so that some of them got very
    <lb/>wet, which put an end to their eel-
    <lb/>catching; shortly after their return, we
    <lb/>had several very heavy showers, which con-
    <lb/>vinced us our house was not proof against
    <lb/>rain, for it beat in at the end, roof, and
    <lb/>several other places.
   </p><p>We have been keeping house about a week,
    <lb/>and experience much inconvenence for
    <lb/>want of our goods, having but five tins,
    <lb/>three spoons, and a camp-kettle, and
    <lb/>a small frying pan, which we borrow-
    <lb/>ed of the Indians; for dish cloths and
    <lb/>towels we are much at a loss, as we
    <lb/>are for soap when we wash our clo-
    <lb/>thes. The want of something to
    <lb/><pb n="97" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_097"/>
    <lb/>knead our bread in, is sensibly ex-
    <lb/>perienced which would not be the
    <lb/>ease if we had tools. When we fry
    <lb/>our meat, or our flitters we have nei-
    <lb/>ther dish nor plate to put them on
    <lb/>but occupy bark. We brought bacon
    <lb/>with us from <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName>, which we
    <lb/>have used very sparingly and it is
    <lb/>nearly run out, and our cheese quite.
    <lb/>we have no prospect of supplying
    <lb/>their place untill our goods arrive.
    <lb/>We have a little flour left, that we
    <lb/>brought from <placeName key="frank">Franklin</placeName> &amp; chocolate
    <lb/>and sugar that we brought from
    <lb/>Pittsburg which are our chief living
    <lb/>and dependance. We have received
    <lb/>some sugar of the Indians as a pre-
    <lb/>sent and some we purchased, which
    <lb/>we find a pretty good substitute
    <lb/>for butter and cheese by biting a bit
    <lb/><pb n="98" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_098"/>
    <lb/>of sugar, which is in a hard cake with
    <lb/>our bread. While at the lower town
    <lb/>we got live quarts of milk a day
    <lb/>but since we came here we have
    <lb/>received none, for there is no cow
    <lb/>among the Indians in this town.

    <p>I neglected not<del>h</del>ing
    <lb/>in its proper place that fifth day
    <lb/>last about 11 oclock we retir’d into
    <lb/>our humble cabin, and were favourd
    <lb/>to witness the overshadowings of con-
    <lb/>soling goodness, to the comforting
    <lb/>and contriting of our spirits, and
    <lb/>this day we had a like opportunity,
    <lb/>and were, I thought alike favoured.
    <lb/>may such seasons be remember’d
    <lb/>with gratitude and with thank-
    <lb/>fulness, and may our young friends
    <lb/>be encouraged and strengthend
    <lb/>to keep up such religious opportuni-
    <lb/><pb n="100" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_100"/>
    <lb/>ties when we are separated which
    <lb/>I trust they will. This is the
    <lb/>fifth day since we came to this
    <lb/>town, we brought but little provision
    <lb/>with us here, having but little to
    <lb/>bring, and had a hope we should
    <lb/>have been able to have gotten some
    <lb/>dryed venison of the Indians here
    <lb/>which has not been the case; we
    <lb/>got a little bear’s oil of them, but
    <lb/>that article is scarce and dear.
    <lb/>This day intending to have made
    <lb/>a dinner of some flitters our bread
    <lb/>being nearly out and our flour
    <lb/>so reduced as to discourage attempt-
    <lb/>ing to bake; while we were frying
    <lb/>our flitters, an Indian man came
    <lb/>in and presented us with about
    <lb/>four pounds of fresh venison with-
    <lb/>out any bone in it, part of which

    <lb/><pb n="101" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_101"/>
    <lb/>we immediately fryed, which with
    <lb/>our flitters made us the most agree-
    <lb/>able dinner we have met with in
    <lb/>the Indian country, we sat down
    <lb/>to it with thankful hearts for so
    <lb/>unexpected a supply. We gave
    <lb/>the Indian a quatter of a dollar
    <lb/>for his venison, which he received with
    <lb/>apparent reluctance but as he could not
    <lb/>speak English, we were altogether at a loss
    <lb/>to know, whether it proceeded from
    <lb/>what we gave him being too much or too little,
    <lb/>but the same afternoon he took three of us
    <lb/>down to <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanters Village</placeName> in a canoe
    <lb/>to attend a general council that was to be-
    <lb/>held there to-morrow he took the money with
    <lb/>him and gave it to <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, and said
    <lb/>something to him in Indian, which
    <lb/>was, that the Venison he brought us was
    <lb/>a gift, and he wished not to receive any
    <lb/>thing
    <lb/><pb n="102" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_102"/>
    <lb/>thing for it, and the money was handed
    <lb/>back to us, which we immediately pre-
    <lb/>sented to him for the trouble of bringing
    <lb/>us down in his canoe, which he receiv-
    <lb/>ed with cheerfulness.

    <p>Two of our number whom we left at
    <lb/><placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName> to take care of Horses, House
    <lb/>&amp; c. came down this morning, and a
    <lb/>number of Indians being collected, a
    <lb/>number of Indians being collected, a-
    <lb/>bout 12 we met them in council, there
    <lb/>being about 30 or 40 a number of whom were
    <lb/>their most respectable women.
   </p><p>Early in the opportunity <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
    <lb/>made a pretty lengthy speech it did
    <lb/>not seem directed to us, which our inter-
    <lb/>preter informed us, was for an Indian
    <lb/>then in the House, who had been charged
    <lb/>with murdering a white man, for which
    <lb/>he had been in Jail at <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName>, and
    <lb/>tried for his life, but being acquited by
    <lb/><pb n="103" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_103"/>
    <lb/>the Jury, he was now at liberty; the trial &amp; court
    <lb/>expences we understood had cost <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
    <lb/>more than 200$; tho’ there was not evidence
    <lb/>to support the charge, yet there was cause to
    <lb/>fear, it was too true, &amp; the Chiefs speech seemed
    <lb/>to be delivered with much earnest, &amp; serious
    <lb/>expostulations. Cornplanter then directed his
    <lb/>speech to us, expressing his satisfaction in
    <lb/>seeing us all in good health, then informing
    <lb/>some of his people had gone out a hunting, and
    <lb/>if we had any thing to propose to them they
    <lb/>were now ready being all collected that
    <lb/>would come. After a short time of silence
    <lb/>wherin we felt an earnest travel we might
    <lb/>be renewedly favoured, a suitable introductory
    <lb/>speech was made on our past, and then the
    <lb/>following conclusion of the <date when="1798-05-22">22nd</date> was read
    <lb/>and interpreted To <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> and all

   <floatingText><body><p>Brothers, We have been among you
    <lb/>several days, and have had councils with
    <lb/>your Chief’s and wise men, and have
    <lb/>looked about your country, and agreed upon
    <lb/>a place for our young men to begin upon
    <lb/>and are glad and thankful to the great
    <lb/>spirit that every thing we have proposed
    <lb/>for your good has been so agreeable, to
    <lb/>your minds that we seem to agree to-
    <lb/>gether like brothers having but one
    <lb/>mind in every thing we do; and we
    <lb/>hope brothers; we shall continue to
    <lb/>be of one mind about all the things
    <lb/>we have been speaking of to you.
    <lb/>Brothers, you know the place we have chosen
    <lb/>for our young men to begin upon, at
    <lb/><placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>, and we hope some of your
    <lb/>young men will settle by them and
    <lb/>fence off lots for themselves, as they
    <lb/>fence off theirs, and our young will
    <lb/><pb n="105" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_105"/>
    <lb/>be willing, to assist &amp; instruct them in
    <lb/>working their lots; and we think our
    <lb/>young men will not be able to raise any
    <lb/>more off their lots this year, than what
    <lb/>they will want for themselves to live on
    <lb/>but we hope against another
    <lb/>year they will have a little to
    <lb/>spare; and we are willing they
    <lb/>should give to your old and infirm
    <lb/>people that cannot work, one bushel
    <lb/>out of four of all the grain they have
    <lb/>to spare. Brothers, In order to encourage
    <lb/>you, still more to take up work and
    <lb/>to follow those ways we pointed out
    <lb/>to you we will agree to help you a
    <lb/>little more. Brothers, We will
    <lb/>send you smith’s tools, when our
    <lb/>young men shall write us word you
    <lb/>stand in need of them.
   </p><p>Brothers. If you are industrious
    <lb/><pb n="106" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_106"/>
    <lb/>this summer and raise a good
    <lb/>deal of corn and some wheat
    <lb/>we will help you to build a
    <lb/>ghrist mill next summer
    <lb/>if a suitable situation can be
    <lb/>found for it; you must find
    <lb/>half the money to build this
    <lb/>mill, and we will find the
    <lb/>other half; and we hope brothers
    <lb/>you will save some money you
    <lb/>get from the white people between
    <lb/>now and then, that so you may
    <lb/>have your share ready against
    <lb/>next spring; and we think you
    <lb/>had better choose one of your chiefs
    <lb/>to keep this money for you, till the
    <lb/>time it is wanted; or perhaps you
    <lb/>money will be all gone for wiskey
    <lb/>or something that will not do
    <lb/>you so much good as a mill would
    <lb/><pb n="107" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_107"/>
    <lb/>Brothers, We are also willing to
    <lb/>encourage you to take up work,
    <lb/>and learn farming, by agreeing
    <lb/>to give some small premiums to
    <lb/>such of our indian brothers who are
    <lb/>industrious and raise a good deal of
    <lb/>grain. Brothers, We will give to
    <lb/>evry indian man living on this river
    <lb/>who, shall raise 25 bushels of wheat
    <lb/>or rye in one year, on his own land
    <lb/>not worked by white people, the sum of
    <lb/>two dollars.
   </p><p>2nd For every 50 bushels of corn raised by one
    <lb/>man in like manner aforsaid, we will
    <lb/>give two dollars.
   </p><p>3rd For every 50 bushels of potatoes raised by
    <lb/>any one man in like manner afore
    <lb/>said, the sum of two dollars.
   </p><p>4th For every two tons of hay raised as
    <lb/>aforesaid and put into a stack or barn
    <lb/><pb n="108" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_108"/>
    <lb/>not being mowed or drawn in
    <lb/>by white people, the sum of two
    <lb/>dollars.
   </p><p>5th F every twelve yards of linen
    <lb/>cloth made by one indian woman,
    <lb/>out of flax raised on her husband’s
    <lb/>land and spun in her own, the
    <lb/>sum of two dollars to be paid
    <lb/>to the woman.
   </p><p>6th For every twelve yards of woolen
    <lb/>or linen cloth, made by one indian
    <lb/>woman, out of the wool of her own,
    <lb/>or her husbands sheep, spun in
    <lb/>her own house, the sum of two
    <lb/>dollars, to be paid to the woman.
    <lb/>Brothers, We will give you these
    <lb/>premiums for four years, if our
    <lb/>young men stay here so long; upon
    <lb/>these conditions that the person
    <lb/>who applies, for the premium
    <lb/><pb n="109" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_109"/>
    <lb/>must produce a certificate from
    <lb/>two of the chiefs, signifying the quan-
    <lb/>tity of grain, cloth &amp; c. for which the
    <lb/>premium is demanded; and that it
    <lb/>was raised or made in manner
    <lb/>abovementioned, and that the person
    <lb/>so applying has not been intoxicated
    <lb/>with whiskey at least for the space
    <lb/>of six months before that time.
    <lb/>And our friends <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName>,
    <lb/><persName key="jswai1">Joel Swayne</persName> and <persName key="hjack1">Holladay Jackson</persName>
    <lb/>are here by authorized, and desired
    <lb/>to pay the above premiums, agreeably
    <lb/>to what is here by before expressed.
    <lb/>We were then favourd seriously
    <lb/>to expostulate with them on various
    <lb/>subjects relative to their moral,
    <lb/>and evil conduct particularly
    <lb/>their excessive use of strong drink
    <lb/>divers instances of which we have
    <lb/><pb n="110" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_110"/>
    <lb/>we have been eye witnesses of
    <lb/>since among them; several of
    <lb/>their women having been thus
    <lb/>disguised; some of them appear’d
    <lb/>solid, and heard us with
    <lb/>attention, but as far as I have
    <lb/>observed since among them
    <lb/>little or no shame covers
    <lb/>an indian for getting drunk.
   </p><p>They informed us they
    <lb/>would withdraw a little
    <lb/>white into another room
    <lb/>and confer on our proposals
    <lb/>which doing, in about an
    <lb/>hour they returned, and
    <lb/>made us an answer in sub-
    <lb/>stance as follows.
   </p><p>Brothers, We now hear
    <lb/>all that you would wish
    <lb/>to do among us; you are
    <lb/><pb n="111" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_111"/>
    <lb/>come here to see us brothers; you
    <lb/>wish us well, you wish us to become
    <lb/>as the white people; the white
    <lb/>people are rich and got every
    <lb/>thing, the indians are poor
    <lb/>and got nothing.
   </p><p>Brothers. You told us one thing,
    <lb/>it be good for us to bild a mill,
    <lb/>we must find 400 dollars, and
    <lb/>you will find the other 400.
    <lb/>Brothers, We cannot say but
    <lb/>few words about this mill at
    <lb/>this time, we will consult <persName key="ichap1">captain
    <lb/>Chapin</persName>, if he thinks we will
    <lb/>receive our money, and will be
    <lb/>able to raise the money you
    <lb/>propose, then we will do it.
    <lb/>Brothers, We know how far you
    <lb/>have come to see us, it is a great
    <lb/>way, from the sea shore where
    <lb/><pb n="112" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_112"/>
    <lb/>our forefathers once lived: the
    <lb/>white people have cheated us,
    <lb/>and got our land from us, and
    <lb/>now we have but little left, we
    <lb/>will try to learn your ways.
    <lb/>Brothers, You know there are ma-
    <lb/>ny bad people amongst us, and
    <lb/>you know we have been cheated,
    <lb/>and that makes us bad and
    <lb/>our minds uneasy; if we had
    <lb/>not been cheated, we should
    <lb/>have been very rich people,
    <lb/>and had plenty of every thing.
    <lb/>and then our minds would
    <lb/>be easy, and we could think
    <lb/>on the good spirit.
   </p><p>Brothers, The reason I men-
    <lb/>tion to you about our being
    <lb/>cheated, some of my warriors
    <lb/>wont mind what I say unto
    <lb/><pb n="113" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_113"/>
    <lb/>them, but will have their own
    <lb/>way, because they know I have
    <lb/>often been cheated by the white people,
    <lb/>if I had never been cheated, then
    <lb/>my warriors would believe me
    <lb/>and mind what I say to them,
    <lb/>but now they won’t mind.
   </p><p>Brothers. We can’t all go to work
    <lb/>at once, some of my warriors
    <lb/>will go a hunting to get provi-
    <lb/>sion, and sometimes they break
    <lb/>a gun, and then it takes a great
    <lb/>deal of money to get a new one,
    <lb/>we have very few hoes and axes, and
    <lb/>such things amongst us and we
    <lb/>are not able to get them.
   </p><p>Brothers, I will go along with
    <lb/>you to <placeName key="conan">Canandorqua</placeName>, and there
    <lb/>we will get matters settled about
    <lb/>the mill, and bring it back to
    <lb/><pb n="114" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_114"/>
    <lb/>your young men in writing,
    <lb/>Brothers. This is all I have
    <lb/>got to say we will now shake
    <lb/>hands. </p></body></floatingText>
    <p>At the close of this speech we
    <lb/>expressed a few words more,
    <lb/>respresenting among other things
    <lb/>the unreasonableness of their
    <lb/>present practice, of their mothers,
    <lb/>wives and sisters, working all
    <lb/>day in the fields, and in the
    <lb/>woods with their hoes and axes,
    <lb/>whilst they themselves were at the
    <lb/>same time playing with their
    <lb/>hows and arrows &amp; c. recommending
    <lb/>them to begin our way by early setting
    <lb/>their boys to business, taking taking
    <lb/>them out to hoe corn &amp; c. thus by
    <lb/>early habituating them to work,
    <lb/>their minds will be turned to it,
    <lb/><pb n="115" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_115"/>
    <lb/>business will become familiar,
    <lb/>and they will not think hard of it.
    <lb/>And as they expressed the white
    <lb/>people were rich and had plenty,
    <lb/>we let them know it was by industry
    <lb/>it was obtained, the men doing their
    <lb/>share of business in the fields &amp; c.
    <lb/>thereby leaving the women more time
    <lb/>to attend to spinning, sewing, dai-
    <lb/>rying &amp; c. in the house. We concluded
    <lb/>with seriously impressing on their minds
    <lb/>the remembrance, that it was from the
    <lb/>good spirit they received every good
    <lb/>thing, and that he could hear every
    <lb/>good word they said, and see every
    <lb/>thing they did, and if they were
    <lb/>good and industrious, this good spirit
    <lb/>would love them, and bless them
    <lb/>with many good things. A few
    <lb/>minutes after we had concluded,
    <lb/><pb n="116" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_116"/>
    <lb/>and informed them we had done,
    <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> observed, now all
    <lb/>things were done and settled, we
    <lb/>will cover up the council fire.
   </p><p>We had no provision of our own
    <lb/>here, therefore concluded to stay and
    <lb/>dine with the chief, about five O
    <lb/>clock we had a loaf of warm in-
    <lb/>dian bread with a mixture of
    <lb/>beans, which had been boiled till
    <lb/>they were softish knead up in it;
    <lb/>the bread was baked in a
    <lb/>dutch oven, having a small
    <lb/>quantity of bears oil put into
    <lb/>the oven with it, and when part
    <lb/>baked the loaf was turned over
    <lb/>with a fresh supply of oil; this
    <lb/>was all we had set before us;
    <lb/>they informed us they had no
    <lb/>meat, and we had heretofore
    <lb/><pb n="117" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_117"/>
    <lb/>shewn our dislike to bread dipped
    <lb/>in oil; however with a good appetite
    <lb/>it went down very well; but before
    <lb/>we had fully done, a little butter
    <lb/>was set before us that they had
    <lb/>obtained somewhere in the village.
    <lb/>We now got half a l of flour of <persName key="cornp2">Corn-
    <lb/>planter</persName> for which he made no
    <lb/>change, and four quarts bears oil
    <lb/>of his wife, which she claiming as
    <lb/>her property, charged us half a
    <lb/>dollar per quart, these our young
    <lb/>men took up this evening with them
    <lb/>to <persName key="genes1">Genesinguhta</persName>, together with
    <lb/>what cholate we had, leaving
    <lb/><persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName> and myself here, to

    <lb/>formed the indians that <persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName>
    <lb/>and myself expected to be at liberty
    <lb/><pb n="118" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_118"/>
    <lb/>in a few days to leave them and
    <lb/>return to our families and friends
    <lb/>and since the concluding of the con-
    <lb/>cil, we see nothing but that
    <lb/>we might set off in a day or two,
    <lb/>if our goods were come, we have
    <lb/>not heard any thing of them
    <lb/>since we left <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName>, but
    <lb/>hope they will shortly arrive,
    <lb/>as tomorrow closes the 18th day
    <lb/>being the time stipulated for their
    <lb/>delivery. Our situation is
    <lb/>different from what it was when we
    <lb/>were here altogether, we then had
    <lb/>a room much to ourselves, and
    <lb/>cooked our own victuals; we now
    <lb/>board with <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanters</persName>, who
    <lb/>uses us kind, and as well as
    <lb/>his house will afford. We have
    <lb/>had tea made of roots of sassafras,
    <lb/><pb n="119" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_119"/>
    <lb/>also of an herb like fern, and thin
    <lb/>cakes of wheat bread baked, or
    <lb/>rather fryed in a pan, they eat
    <lb/>very well, so that we have no
    <lb/>cause to complain of our living if it
    <lb/>was not for their dirt &amp; c. which try
    <lb/>us. Our road from <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName> here,
    <lb/>was pretty much of a northeast course,
    <lb/>and part of it very rough and tedious
    <lb/>so that we have been desirous of finding
    <lb/>a nearer and better way home, we
    <lb/>early enquired of <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> if
    <lb/>their was any path from this town
    <lb/>across the mountains to the big
      <lb/>Island on <placeName key="susqu">Susquehanna</placeName> at the
    <lb/>mouth of <placeName key="balde">Baldeagle creek</placeName>, he in-
    <lb/>formed us there was a path, which
    <lb/>was but little used, and through
    <lb/>a rough uninhabited country, we
    <lb/>should have to lay out at nights,
    <lb/><pb n="120" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_120"/>
    <lb/>carry provisions for ourselfes
    <lb/>and some for our horses, that
    <lb/>it would take us five days,
    <lb/>and it was so mountainous
    <lb/>and rough that it would be
    <lb/>with the greatest difficulty we
    <lb/>could get our horses along. We
    <lb/>then enquired for a way to <placeName key="conan">Canan-
    <lb/>darque</placeName>, and how far, he told us
    <lb/>it was 160 miles and not a very
    <lb/>difficult road, that he and his
    <lb/>son <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName> were going there in
    <lb/>a few days, and he would be
    <lb/>glad of our company. We had
    <lb/>felt some little draft in our
    <lb/>minds to go home by <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>,
    <lb/>and Canandarque being in
    <lb/>the way made the chiefs pro-
    <lb/>posal feel pleasant, but about
    <lb/>this date a runner from the chiefs
    <lb/><pb n="121" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_121"/>
    <lb/>at <placeName key="buffa">Buffals</placeName>, arrived at <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanters

    <lb/>ring his attendance there as soon as
    <lb/>he conveniently could, for the surveyors
    <lb/>and commissioners from <persName key="rmorr1">Robert Morris</persName>
    <lb/>and company were coming to run out
    <lb/>the land the Indians sold them
    <lb/>last fall, and also to run and settle
    <lb/>the lines of the Indians reservations.
    <lb/>The chief expressed a great desire
    <lb/><persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName> and myself should
    <lb/>go with him to the coucil and attend
    <lb/>these while the business was transact-
    <lb/>ing, which upon weighing we felt a
    <lb/>freedom to comply with.
   </p><p>While we were writing this after-
    <lb/>noon we heard an uncommon noise,
    <lb/>which caused us to look out to see from
    <lb/>what it proceeded, where we saw a
    <lb/>man in a frightful dress, we then
    <lb/><pb n="122" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_122"/>
    <lb/>walked out more fully to see the
    <lb/>sight, when we saw two men
    <lb/>with naked arms, thighs and
    <lb/>legs, they had bearskins on their
    <lb/>backs, which hung down below
    <lb/>their hips, and tyed across their
    <lb/>breast, and on their heads they
    <lb/>had a grim and terrible apperance
    <lb/>This false face for so it was clalled,
    <lb/>was made as frightful as nature
    <lb/>could invent; the hair on its head
    <lb/>hanging forward over the face; the
    <lb/>mouth grinning, and much
    <lb/>aside, the nose and cheeks
    <lb/>wrinkled and very huge; the
    <lb/>eyes set round with tin to
    <lb/>resemble uncommon staring,
    <lb/>and the whole face painted
    <lb/>red and black. Each of those
    <lb/>men had in their hands a
    <lb/><pb n="123" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_123"/>
    <lb/>stick of about 8 inches long, fastened
    <lb/>to a shell of a water tertoise; shells
    <lb/>had some small stones or other hard
    <lb/>substances in them, which made
    <lb/>a great rattling; which noise was
    <lb/>much increased by their rubbing
    <lb/>them against the logs of a certain
    <lb/>house, where they appeared to be
    <lb/>stationed as guards. The whole
    <lb/>conduct of these men was truly fran-
    <lb/>tick. A large number of spectators at
    <lb/>a considerable distance surrounded
    <lb/>the house, many of whom were young
    <lb/>men endeavouring to peep through the
    <lb/>cracks of the logs into the house and
    <lb/>that these guards used great exertion
    <lb/>to keep them off or to catch them it
    <lb/>looked dreadful to fall into their hands
    <lb/>wich made the young men use great
    <lb/>endeavours to avoid it. I asked our
    <lb/><pb n="124" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_124"/>
    <lb/>interpreter, what would be the
    <lb/>consequence, if any of them
    <lb/>should be taken, he said they
    <lb/>would put ashes on their heads,
    <lb/>and very much degrade them;
    <lb/>we saw a number of elderly
    <lb/>women going into the house,
    <lb/>whom these monsters quetly
    <lb/>let pass, from which circum-
    <lb/>stances and some others, we were
    <lb/>of the mind, there was a women
    <lb/>in labour in said house, and this
    <lb/>wild scene was transacted, as a
    <lb/>ceremony or rejoiceing, at the birth
    <lb/>of a child, or else to keep the boys
    <lb/>and young men from coming nigh
    <lb/>the house or looking in, as their
    <lb/>construction was such as not to
    <lb/>admit of privecy. Our interpreter
    <lb/>was a young man and did not
    <lb/><pb n="125" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_125"/>
    <lb/>seem fully to understand, or else
    <lb/>did not care to tell the cause of the
    <lb/>women’s being there, but said, they
    <lb/>had met there for a frolick, and to
    <lb/>drink whiskey, but as far as we
    <lb/>could discover neither their conducts
    <lb/>nor countenances answered this
    <lb/>description.

    <p>This day near 12 o’clock,
    <lb/>which I was writing to my dear
    <lb/>wife and family, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanters</persName>
    <lb/>wife with an expression of joy on
    <lb/>her countenance came into our
    <lb/>apartment and pointing with her
    <lb/>hand down the river, expressed as
    <lb/>plain as she could, “canoe, canoe”
    <lb/>it struck us immediately that our
    <lb/>boat was coming, which was a agree-
    <lb/>able news to us; we went directly
    <lb/>to the river side, but not observing
    <lb/><pb n="126" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_126"/>
    <lb/>it any where in view, she poin-
    <lb/>ted with her hand across a
    <lb/>bottom in so sensible manner,
    <lb/>that it left no remaining doubt,
    <lb/>but she had seen it, in a little
    <lb/>time the boat came safely along
    <lb/>by the side of the town, the
    <lb/>arrival of which was heartily
    <lb/>welcomed both by us &amp; the Indians
    <lb/>many of the latter gathering round
    <lb/>the shore, having never seen such a
    <lb/>boat before most of them being only
    <lb/>acquainted with canoes. The
    <lb/>captain inform’d us he did not leave
    <lb/><placeName key="pitts">Pittsburg</placeName> until three days later than
    <lb/>he expected, that he had been 15 days
    <lb/>coming &amp; that it was 270 miles to follow
    <lb/>the course of the river; both he &amp; his
    <lb/>men appear’d tired, expressing much
    <lb/>satisfaction they had gotten here,
    <lb/><pb n="127" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_127"/>
    <lb/>not expecting we would want them
    <lb/>to go further but when we let them
    <lb/>know our house was 9 miles further up
    <lb/>the river, &amp; we wanted the goods taken
    <lb/>there, they submitted to comply, with
    <lb/>much reluctance &amp; not until we first
    <lb/>engaged to give them three dollars ex-
    <lb/>traordinary, &amp; ½ a dollar to an Indian
    <lb/>to pilot them, the captain saying he
    <lb/>was a stranger higher up the river.
   </p><p>We have been entirely unable since
    <lb/>our arrival here to have any conversation
    <lb/>with the Indians without an interpreter
    <lb/>there being very few among them who
    <lb/>understand any English, &amp; fewer who
    <lb/>can or will express one word, &amp; our
    <lb/>interpreter not being ready at the business
    <lb/>it was a discouragement to us to touch
    <lb/>on religious subjects; we had a strong
    <lb/>desire to know if they had any religious
    <lb/><pb n="128" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_128"/>
    <lb/>rites or ceremonies amongst them &amp;
    <lb/>last evening having some conversation
    <lb/>with <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> on the subject, he
    <lb/>inform’d us, they had two solemnites
    <lb/>in a year, when it was their practice
    <lb/>for their men &amp; women generally to meet
    <lb/>together in one place; the first was
    <lb/>in the spring, the other in the fall
    <lb/>about the time corn was ripe, the
    <lb/>latter was a time of rejoicing, &amp; to
    <lb/>return thanks to the Great Spirit for
    <lb/>this blessing. They did not keep
    <lb/>the first day of the week, but every
    <lb/>one tried to think good in his own
    <lb/>mind; &amp; as we could read the bible
    <lb/>he queried whether there was any
    <lb/>thing said in it about the Indians.
    <lb/>We inform’d him the bible mention’d
    <lb/>all nations, kindred, tongues &amp; people,
    <lb/>&amp; that included the Indians, &amp; we
    <lb/><pb n="129" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_129"/>
    <lb/>would have been glad to have told
    <lb/>him, tho’ the Indians could not read
    <lb/>the bible, yet they were not wholly
    <lb/>depriv’d of the benefits of the coming
    <lb/>of Christ, for that a manifestation of
    <lb/>his spirit, or measure of his grace
    <lb/>was placed in each of their hearts,
    <lb/>&amp; would, if minded, or giv’n way to,
    <lb/>reprove for all wicked words &amp; wicked
    <lb/>actions, also produce peace for well doing,
    <lb/>but this was too refin’d &amp; delicate a
    <lb/>subject for our interpreter to handle.
   </p><p>I have not been able fully to learn
    <lb/>what number of Indians this village
    <lb/>contains, but <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> inform’d us
    <lb/>there were about 400 persons, young &amp;
    <lb/>old, under his superintendency; much
    <lb/>the larger half of whom, are in or near
    <lb/>this town; he also inform’d us, that in
    <lb/>his whole district, there were three
    <lb/><pb n="130" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_130"/>
    <lb/>horses, 14 cow kind, beside one yoke of

    <lb/>the boatmen having got their business

    <lb/>went merrily down the lively current
    <lb/>expecting in 4 days to arrive at

    <lb/>spent in unpacking our goods, drying
    <lb/>those that were wet, &amp; storeing them
    <lb/>away in our cabin, which prov’d too
    <lb/>small for the purpose, however we
    <lb/>got them arranged in such a manner
    <lb/>as to leave a pretty good conveniency for
    <lb/>house keeping, we now experienced a
    <lb/>great change, our naked walls empty
    <lb/>house &amp; bare cupboard met with a
    <lb/>rich supply, our hard &amp; cold beds were
    <lb/>warm’d &amp; soften’d with blankets; we

    <p>We were busy this morning in
    <lb/>hanging our grindstone, &amp; putting
    <lb/>handles in some of our tools.
    <lb/><persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName> &amp; myself accompanied
    <lb/>by an Indian chief went up the
    <lb/>river in a canoe near one mile
    <lb/>above our settlement to view a stream
    <lb/>that was on the opposite shore, which
    <lb/>we were inform’d was suitable to build
    <lb/>a mill on upon viewing it we found
    <lb/>plenty of fall, &amp; sufficiency of water
    <lb/>for a grist mill, tho’ the stream was
    <lb/>not large, it came down between 2
    <lb/>high hills 25 perches of a head
    <lb/>race would carry the water high enough
    <lb/>for the purpose &amp; within 5
    <lb/><pb n="133" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_133"/>
    <lb/>perches of the river is a very suitable
    <lb/>bank to erect a mill on, where a tale
    <lb/>race might be readily dug into the
    <lb/>river, so that canoes might come up to
    <lb/>the door a large quantity of flat
    <lb/>stones for building might be readily
    <lb/>got to do such stone work as may be
    <lb/>thought necessary; but against these
    <lb/>advantages the mill will stand on
    <lb/>the north side of a high hill, loaded
    <lb/>with timber, so that the sun in the
    <lb/>winter season will make but little
    <lb/>impression, &amp; the head race will have
    <lb/>to be carried fifteen or more perches along
    <lb/>the side of a very steep, stony bank, so
    <lb/>that it will be with great difficulty a
    <lb/>race can be dug for the purpose. A
    <lb/>mill might be erected forty perches
    <lb/>from the river above the rocks, but
    <lb/>then canoes could not be brought
    <lb/><pb n="134" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_134"/>
    <lb/>up to the mill by reason of the
    <lb/>fall in the stream.
   </p><p>We thought by raising a dam 4 feet
    <lb/>high the water might be taken out
    <lb/>below the rocks, so as to have 8 or 10 ft
    <lb/>head &amp; fall as far as we have been
    <lb/>able to discover, streams suitable for mills
    <lb/>are very scarce in this river.

    <p>This day for the first time I under

    <p>our young men

    <lb/><pb n="135" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_135"/>
    <lb/>&amp; do the kitchen work. We are
    <lb/>every day visited by more or less of the

    <lb/>to let them know we did not work on

    <lb/>Since our coming into these parts we

    <lb/>from setting the plough to go, but if
    <lb/>the weather suits, hope to start it to-

    <lb/>had some time ago, yet nearly as clear

    <lb/>that I do not recollect seeing the sun rise
    <lb/>clear since we came here, &amp; as it has
    <lb/>been a rainy, damp time latterly, clouds

    <lb/>wherein the canopy of divine love

    <lb/>was spread over us, to the contriting of

    <lb/>ancient goodness might be near to them
    <lb/>that stay’d, to comfort, strengthen &amp;
    <lb/>preserve in their lonely cottage, &amp; ar-
    <lb/>duous undertaking; which considering
    <lb/>the many favours we have experienced

    <lb/>as they were truly watchful, &amp; atten-

    <lb/>continued; &amp; that we who are going
    <lb/>might continue to experience the
    <lb/>Lord’s protecting power thro’ a solitary
    <lb/>wilderness, &amp; tedious journey. We

    <p>A very foggy morning with some

    <lb/>been very much afflicted, with a

    <lb/>ed his coming sooner, &amp; that now he
    <lb/>could not go with us for three days on
    <lb/>their account, for which he was
    <lb/><pb n="142" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_142"/>
    <lb/>very sorry, but if we did not like
    <lb/>to wait so long, he would hire a
    <lb/>guide &amp; send with us. We inform’d
    <lb/>him we were very sorry circum-
    <lb/>stances had happen’d so as to
    <lb/>prevent our having his company
    <lb/>but believ’d it would be best for us
    <lb/>to set off tomorrow morning, for
    <lb/>we wish’d to spend a few days with
    <lb/>our friends in <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>, &amp; in seven
    <lb/>days hoped we could meet him at
    <lb/><placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>, where he said he in-
    <lb/>tended to be on that day, if the
    <lb/>state of his family would permit
    <lb/>a guide was accordingly provided
    <lb/>who engaged to call on us tomorrow
    <lb/>morning by sun rise. A heavy
    <lb/>shower of rain this evening, so our
    <lb/>going home which way we will
    <lb/>looks discouraging, on account of
    <lb/><pb n="143" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_143"/>
    <lb/>getting over some large waters; this river
    <lb/>for several days past has been near 3
    <lb/>feet higher than when we first came

    <p>About sunrise this morning our guide
    <lb/>Indian <persName key="checkplace">John</persName>, a chief who lives in this
    <lb/>town, call’d on us, &amp; being ready to take
    <lb/>our departure, about 5 Oclock we look
    <lb/>an affectionate farewell of our friends
    <lb/>&amp; set off for the mouth of <placeName key="buffr">Buffaloe</placeName>.
    <lb/>We went up the river about 5 miles,
    <lb/>thro’ a very thick wood, with a great
    <lb/>quantity of windfell timber, &amp; a large
    <lb/>proportion of young under stuff
    <lb/>growing, up, &amp; next to no pain; so that
    <lb/>we presently got very wet from the bushes
    <lb/>we then left the river to our right; and
    <lb/>went up a fine country, heavily timber’d
    <lb/>mostly white pine, having a small
    <lb/><pb n="144" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_144"/>
    <lb/>creek at some distance on our right.
    <lb/>In 3 or 4 miles we pass’d thro’ an old
    <lb/>Indian field, then up the aforesaid water
    <lb/>thro’ some very good land, with a lux-
    <lb/>uriant growth of grass &amp; weeds of various
    <lb/>kinds, &amp; very thick wood about 4 miles.
    <lb/>Then enter’d a rough hilly country
    <lb/>heavily timber’d, mostly hemlock
    <lb/>&amp; I thought thin land for about 7 or
    <lb/>8 miles, a large quantity of which
    <lb/>was down, so that with the hills,
    <lb/>the logs the brush &amp; swampy guts
    <lb/>it requir’d patience &amp; a good stock
    <lb/>of spirits. I mention’d to my com-
    <lb/>panion some time after we set off
    <lb/>this morning, that my mind was
    <lb/>uncommonly easy, cheerful &amp; sweet,
    <lb/>so that I pass’d along in a lively, well
    <lb/>qualified state to make travelling
    <lb/>pleasant, but before evening I found
    <lb/><pb n="145" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_145"/>
    <lb/>my stock of spirits was much exhausted.
    <lb/>About 11 Oclock we had a very heavy
    <lb/>rain, such an one as but seldom hap-
    <lb/>pens, it lasted perhaps an hour, so
    <lb/>that we got very wet. When it abated
    <lb/>we stopped &amp; barked some trees to have
    <lb/>a trough to feed our horses out of, &amp;
    <lb/>taking some refreshment ourselves, we
    <lb/>mounted, having for several miles
    <lb/>past, been riding over fine land, a
    <lb/>little hilly, &amp; loaded with timber
    <lb/>we had some fears about getting
    <lb/>over <placeName key="catar">Catarawgus</placeName> this morning before
    <lb/>we started, &amp; this heavy rain increasd
    <lb/>them; however we mov’d on, over a
    <lb/>fine country, tho’ a trying road, the
    <lb/>limbs, the brush, &amp; the logs, were ever
    <lb/>in our way; much of the timber
    <lb/>in this day’s ride has been hemlock,
    <lb/>some chesnut, sugar maple, beech,
    <lb/><pb n="146" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_146"/>
    <lb/>oak &amp; c. but as we advanc’d towards
    <lb/><placeName key="catar">Catarawgus</placeName>, we had a large pro-
    <lb/>portion of very fine poplars; when
    <lb/>we got near to the river we pass’d
    <lb/>thro’ a very rich bottom, with an
    <lb/>uncommonly luxuriant growth of
    <lb/>vegetation; &amp; about sunset arrived
    <lb/>at the stream, which we found to
    <lb/>be many perches out of its banks
    <lb/>at the common fording place, &amp; our
    <lb/>guide made signs to us that it
    <lb/>would run over our horses backs
    <lb/>&amp; sweep them away; we therefore
    <lb/>concluded to pitch camp, being in
    <lb/>an open bottom, where there was
    <lb/>pretty well of grass, so that our
    <lb/>horses would have done very well
    <lb/>if it had not been for the gnats
    <lb/>&amp; musquettos; we struck up a fire
    <lb/>&amp; under some bushes we had put
    <lb/><pb n="147" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_147"/>
    <lb/>up to keep off the dew, got a pretty
    <lb/>comfortable night’s rest. In the
    <lb/>evening we view’d the river above
    <lb/>the fording place, &amp; found there were
    <lb/>some marks of its having fallen an
    <lb/>inch or more; We saw neither house
    <lb/>nor cabin in this day’s ride. 35 miles.

    <p>Rose early this morning &amp; upon
    <lb/>viewing <placeName key="catar">Catarawgus</placeName> we found it
    <lb/>had fallen several inches; we
    <lb/>therefore fed our horses, &amp; prepar’d
    <lb/>for moving, we had lodged on an
    <lb/>island, which our guide took us
    <lb/>round to the head of that so we
    <lb/>might have the advantage of the
    <lb/>current in crossing it; we found
    <lb/>the bed of the creek was wide,
    <lb/>&amp; there was a large gravelly
    <lb/>island several perches from our
    <lb/>shore; we descended the bank &amp;
    <lb/><pb n="148" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_148"/>
    <lb/>rode to it, the water not being
    <lb/>more than knee keep, we then
    <lb/>went down this island 20 or
    <lb/>more perches to where our guide
    <lb/>made signs for us to cross, the
    <lb/>water ran very swiftly, but
    <lb/>did not appear to be as deep as
    <lb/>he gave us to expect, which
    <lb/>was to come within 6 inches of
    <lb/>the top of our horses backs; we
    <lb/>made signs to our guide to lead
    <lb/>the way, he being well mounted
    <lb/>on <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Simmons'</persName> mare, the
    <lb/>largest beast in company; but
    <lb/>he shewd evident marks of fear;
    <lb/>&amp; the task being likely to fall
    <lb/>on me, I pulled off my great
    <lb/>coat &amp; tyed it up well behind
    <lb/>me, &amp; rais’d my saddle bags, by
    <lb/>putting some luggage under
    <lb/><pb n="149" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_149"/>
    <lb/>them; &amp; having previously cut a
    <lb/>pole to carry in my hand to mea-
    <lb/>sure the depth of the stream &amp; c.
    <lb/>I enter’d the river without much
    <lb/>fear, tho’ not without care; &amp; found
    <lb/>our guide was mistaken in its depth
    <lb/>&amp; well for us he was, for had it been as
    <lb/>deep as he expected no horse could
    <lb/>have stood before the stream; I got safe-
    <lb/>ly thro’ &amp; my companions view’d me
    <lb/>with exercise of mind, &amp; when they saw
    <lb/>me safely landed on the opposite shore
    <lb/>they follow’d &amp; also arrived safe, with
    <lb/>gladden’d hearts; we then pursued
    <lb/>our journey with cheerfulness, down
    <lb/>the rich bottoms of said stream; a great
    <lb/>number of large beautiful poplars,
    <lb/>white oaks, pines, &amp; black walnuts,
    <lb/>made their appearance, also some
    <lb/>fine natural meadows of good grass.
    <lb/><pb n="150" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_150"/>
    <lb/>In 10 miles we arrived at a village
    <lb/>of <orgName key="munseeind">Munsey Indians</orgName> in an excellent
    <lb/>country, being the first dwellings
    <lb/>we had seen since we left the
    <lb/><placeName key="alleg">Alleghany river</placeName> having rode through
    <lb/>an open wood for 4 or 5 miles past,
    <lb/>grown up with herbage of different
    <lb/>kinds, very thick, &amp; near 3 feet high,
    <lb/>we stopp’d at a house in this vil-
    <lb/>lage &amp; breakfasted on our own pro-
    <lb/>visions. The town &amp; pasture
    <lb/>land was enclos’d in a lot of per-
    <lb/>haps 12 or more acres, which look’d
    <lb/>clean &amp; pretty, having very good
    <lb/>pasture in the inclosure, where
    <lb/>were several horses, cows, &amp; swine.
    <lb/>Their houses look’d pretty snug,
    <lb/>perhaps 18 or 20, in number; their
    <lb/>corn land was down towards the
    <lb/>river; they plant it without
    <lb/><pb n="151" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_151"/>
    <lb/>any inclosure, keeping their stock
    <lb/>in the lot. The house we
    <lb/>went into had a large quantity
    <lb/>of corn hanging up in it consid-
    <lb/>erably more than I saw all the
    <lb/>time I was at <placeName key="alleg1">Alleghany</placeName>; &amp; upon
    <lb/>enquiry we understood they sell
    <lb/>many bushels every year to the
    <lb/>white people; their vicinity o
    <lb/><placeName key="lakee">lake Erie</placeName> makes it easy convey-
    <lb/>ing it down the river there, &amp;
    <lb/>then it goes by water to new
    <lb/>settled countries; we were informd
    <lb/>it was as low as 4 or 5 shillings per
    <lb/>bushel, which is cheap for a new
    <lb/>country. We found in <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>
    <lb/>&amp; other places corn rated at a dollar
    <lb/>per bushel. Most of the principal
    <lb/>men in the village &amp; others gather’d
    <lb/>into the house where we were, &amp;
    <lb/><pb n="152" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_152"/>
    <lb/>There being a white man living
    <lb/>amongst them that could interpret
    <lb/>we inform’d them of what we
    <lb/>had been doing at <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanter’s
    <lb/>settlement</placeName>, &amp; of the young men
    <lb/>we had left there to instruct the
    <lb/>Indians to plough &amp; c. &amp; of Friends
    <lb/>concern for the Indians in general;
    <lb/>with which they express’d their
    <lb/>satisfaction, saying they took it
    <lb/>very kind that we call’d to see
    <lb/>them, &amp; to inform them of what we
    <lb/>had been doing at <placeName key="cornp">Jeniscotago</placeName>,
    <lb/>for they had heard something
    <lb/>about it, but they had nothing
    <lb/>further to say; We then shook
    <lb/>hands with them &amp; bid them
    <lb/>farewell. We then turn’d a
    <lb/>little to the right, leaving <placeName key="catar">Cata-
    <lb/>rawgus</placeName> considerably to our left,
    <lb/><pb n="153" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_153"/>
    <lb/>&amp; in about 7 miles of a very swampy
    <lb/>tedious road, thro’ good land abounding
    <lb/>with poplars &amp; with other timber
    <lb/>heavily loaded, we arrived at <placeName key="lakee">lake
    <lb/>Erie</placeName>. Here we gratified our
    <lb/>eyes a while in viewing the obsequi
    <lb/>ous element, as far as the convex
    <lb/>state of the globe would admit
    <lb/>We now turn’d still more to the
    <lb/>right, &amp; went along the beach to the
    <lb/>mouth of <placeName key="buffr">Buffaloe</placeName> 29 miles; The pros-
    <lb/>pect the remaining part of this day
    <lb/>was pleasant, &amp; it was rather heighten’d
    <lb/>by our being so long confin’d to the woods.
    <lb/>The road was in places good, but in
    <lb/>other places very heavy, the gravel
    <lb/>being near fetlock deep. We had
    <lb/>the lake on our left, the surf rolling
    <lb/>gently to the shore in waves two or
    <lb/>three feet high, On our right was
    <lb/><pb n="154" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_154"/>
    <lb/>a majestic appearance of rocks &amp;
    <lb/>stones piled up in very uniform
    <lb/>order, in places from 20 to 60 feet
    <lb/>high, as upright as the wall of
    <lb/>a house, &amp; in other places projecting
    <lb/>over several feet; The bottom of these
    <lb/>rocks with the beating of the waves,
    <lb/>&amp; sand &amp; gravel, were worn into
    <lb/>curious shapes, &amp; as smooth as polish’d
    <lb/>marble; From the tops of these
    <lb/>rocks the water was trickling
    <lb/>down very entertainingly; I observ’d
    <lb/>some rocks standing in the edge
    <lb/>of the water, as large over &amp; round
    <lb/>as a mill stone, the upper part
    <lb/>whereof was worn nearly to the
    <lb/>shape of the largest end of an
    <lb/>egg, &amp; as round as if turn’d in a
    <lb/>lathe. In a number of places
    <lb/>the water came up to the wall
    <lb/><pb n="155" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_155"/>
    <lb/>of rocks, so that we had to ride 40
    <lb/>or more perches in the lake, in places
    <lb/>belly deep, &amp; the water being very dirty
    <lb/>at the shore, with its beating the
    <lb/>sand &amp; c. we could not see the bottom
    <lb/>&amp; did not know, but the next step
    <lb/>the horses made might take them
    <lb/>over their backs; but what made
    <lb/>it look the most romantick was,
    <lb/>the continual beating of the waves
    <lb/>which came up against these rocks
    <lb/>in such force, that the water would
    <lb/>at times fly over our heads, &amp; suffi-
    <lb/>ciently wet the traveller. The
    <lb/>last 10 miles we very much left the
    <lb/>rocks, &amp; as we advanced the bank grew
    <lb/>lower, so that very high westerly winds
    <lb/>raise the water &amp; waves on this side
    <lb/>the lake until it overflows the bank
    <lb/>&amp; drowns a considerable country;
    <lb/><pb n="156" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_156"/>
    <lb/>which is very level, &amp; wet for
    <lb/>common. It was very evident
    <lb/>for a number of miles here away
    <lb/>that the lake is gradually
    <lb/>moving towards the south-east,
    <lb/>as most of the trees which stand
    <lb/>along its margin have the dirt
    <lb/>wash’d away from the roots for
    <lb/>3,4,or more feet deep; so that they
    <lb/>are dead &amp; falling fast, &amp; I thought
    <lb/>it was as visible when on the
    <lb/><placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName> shore opposite, that the
    <lb/>land was gaining there.
   </p><p>We got to the mouth of
    <lb/><placeName key="buffr">Buffaloe</placeName> before sunset, where
    <lb/>we put our saddles &amp; baggage
    <lb/>into a boat, which took us over,
    <lb/>&amp; we swam our horses thro’ the
    <lb/>river, it being perhaps near
    <lb/>100 yards over, &amp; 10 or more feet deep
    <lb/><pb n="157" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_157"/>
    <lb/>here we met with a company of
    <lb/>men who were going to run out
    <lb/><persName key="rmorr1">Robert Morris’</persName> late purchase of the
    <lb/>Indians, into townships; <persName key="jthom4">John

    <lb/>invited us to stay all night with
    <lb/>them, &amp; directed a tent to be put
    <lb/>up for us; we acknowledg’d his kind-
    <lb/>ness &amp; accepted his offer; After
    <lb/>feeding our horses we turn’d them
    <lb/>out to bare picking in an open bot-
    <lb/>tom, we ourselves were kindly enter-
    <lb/>tain’d with great simplicity, on
    <lb/>bread, fish, &amp; chocolate, &amp; got a

    <lb/><pb n="161" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_161"/>
    <lb/>friends down on the mountain, as
    <lb/>it is call’d; In 7 miles we came on

    <lb/>to the great falls, having about 2

    <lb/>&amp; runs across the river, which
    <lb/>bank we thought not safe to de-
    <lb/>scend when here before by reason
    <lb/>of the sleet or ice, that cover’d the
    <lb/>hill, which sleet had collected
    <lb/>from the mist that ascended from
    <lb/>the violent agitation of the water.
    <lb/>It was now about noon &amp; a clear
    <lb/>warm day, the fog taht ascended
    <lb/>was abundantly less than the
    <lb/>cold morning I was here before
    <lb/>yet before we got to the bottom of
    <lb/>the bank the bushes &amp; c. became
    <lb/>very wet, &amp; I believ’d had we stay’d
    <lb/>on the rock at the grand pitch
    <lb/>one hour our cloathes would
    <lb/>have been nearly wet thro’; we
    <lb/>now had a very fair prospect
    <lb/>of the water shooting over the
    <lb/><pb n="163" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_163"/>
    <lb/>rock, &amp; its descending with very
    <lb/>great rapidity in a perpendicu-
    <lb/>lar direction, 150 feet &amp; the foam
    <lb/>ing state of the river, for many
    <lb/>perches below; it was a trial &amp;
    <lb/>appear’d dangerous to go to the
    <lb/>edge of the rock, to look down; I
    <lb/>did it by going on my hands &amp;
    <lb/>knees, &amp; at the edge I found the
    <lb/>rock was hollow under me for a
    <lb/>number of feet back, &amp; not more
    <lb/>than one foot thick; we would
    <lb/>have been glad to have descended
    <lb/>to the bottom of this pitch, but we
    <lb/>had no pilot, &amp; there was no possi-
    <lb/>bility of getting down any where
    <lb/>in view, nor as I have understood
    <lb/>short of half a mile down the
    <lb/>river, &amp; there with great difficulty,
    <lb/>After <del>staying</del> about 20 minuets
    <lb/><pb n="164" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_164"/>
    <lb/>to view this awful &amp; grand
    <lb/>scene, we return’d up the steep
    <lb/>bank with difficulty, &amp; in 4 miles
    <lb/>arrived at <persName key="jmoor2">Jeremiah Moore’s</persName>,
    <lb/>where we were kindly reciev’d.
    <lb/>In about an hour after we got
    <lb/>there, a friend from the <placeName key="short">short
    <lb/>Hills</placeName>, came in particularly
    <lb/>requesting that Jeremiah Moore
    <lb/>&amp; <persName key="jhill1">John Hill</persName>, would come up to
    <lb/>their assistance, a difficulty
    <lb/>having taken place respecting
    <lb/>a meeting house they were build-
    <lb/>ing so that the work was stopp’d.
    <lb/>The friend was much concern’d
    <lb/>about it, as was Jeremiah, when he
    <lb/>heard the information, &amp; they
    <lb/>express’d a great desire we would
    <lb/>go with them, hopeing that our
    <lb/>assistance to accommodate matters
    <lb/><pb n="165" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_165"/>
    <lb/>would be very useful; we had
    <lb/>no prospect of going so far, &amp; the
    <lb/>time for our returning to <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>
    <lb/>being fix’d, we felt cautious in any
    <lb/>hasty result, but let the friends
    <lb/>know, we would consider the re-
    <lb/>quest &amp; go in the morning with
    <lb/>them to <persName key="jhill1">John Hill’s</persName>, which was six
    <lb/>miles on the way, &amp; where we had

    <lb/>to meet all such as could be noti-

    <lb/>at 2 Oclock. And <persName key="jgilh1">Joshua Gil-

    <lb/>then to the meeting hosue, where
    <lb/>we met with most of the men
    <lb/>professors likely to constitute that
    <lb/>meeting, I think I may say it
    <lb/>was a time of renew’d favour,
    <lb/>many minds were tendered, &amp;
    <lb/>the difficulties treated on in
    <lb/>such a manner that they
    <lb/>appear’d to be remov’d to gene-
    <lb/>ral satisfaction, the work agree’d
    <lb/>to be prosecuted, &amp; the time fix’d
    <lb/>for going on with it. We
    <lb/>felt well satisfied we had giv’n
    <lb/>up to attend, &amp; friends ex-
    <lb/><pb n="167" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_167"/>
    <lb/>press’d great satisfaction with
    <lb/>our being there, &amp; that they
    <lb/>thought our coming was providen-
    <lb/>tial. They have purchas’d 10 acres
    <lb/>of land of <persName key="stayl1">Samuel Taylor</persName>, part
    <lb/>of which is clear’d &amp; the house
    <lb/>is rais’d &amp; nearly shingled in,
    <lb/>it is built of snug round logs
    <lb/>about 20 by 22 feet square. I was
    <lb/>much pleas’d to see the faces of
    <lb/>those we had labour’d amongst
    <lb/>last fall, &amp; found the committee
    <lb/>had left a sweet savour behind

    <lb/>they would have been again visit-
    <lb/>ed this summer, but when they
    <lb/>were inform’d the committee was

    <lb/>small trial, however they ex-
    <lb/>press’d great satisfaction we
    <lb/>had come over the river, &amp; that
    <lb/>the sight of a solid friend did
    <lb/>them good; it was some trial
    <lb/>to leave them so soon, as there
    <lb/>was a general pressing of us to
    <lb/>have stayed longer, &amp; we had much
    <lb/>love given us in charge, to carry
    <lb/>back to their friends, particular-
    <lb/>ly to such who had visited

   <p>A fine morning set off before
    <lb/>sunrise; about 100 perches above our
    <lb/>lodging on an eminence of perhaps
    <lb/>250 or 300 feet elevation we had a
    <lb/>view of the <placeName key="lakeo">lake Ontario</placeName>, at 10 or 12
    <lb/>miles distance; also at 12 or 14 miles
    <lb/>distance on a straight line we had
    <lb/>a fair view of the fog or mist which
    <lb/>ascended like a cloud from the great
    <lb/>falls; we could while riding along
    <lb/>very plainly hear the roaring of the
    <lb/>water, like the noise of a mighty wind.
    <lb/>went to <persName key="jhill1">John Hill’s</persName> to breakfast, 10 miles;
    <lb/>stopped at <persName key="bhill1">Benjamin Hills</persName>, nearby,

  <p>Having gotten our linen 7 c. wash’d,
    <lb/>&amp; being ready to leave <placeName key="canad">Canada</placeName>, I
    <lb/>feel easy to make one general
    <lb/>note of the face of the country,
    <lb/>timber &amp; c. As far as I have
    <lb/>been thro’ it, in the general it is
    <lb/>a level country; while in a state
    <lb/>of woods much of it wet, with a
    <lb/>black mud on the top, &amp; a stiff clay
    <lb/>under, which clay prevents the
    <lb/>water from soaking <del>under</del> down;
    <lb/>when clear’d in a dry time this
    <lb/>day land bakes very hard, &amp; is diffi-
    <lb/>cult tilling, tho’ in other places
    <lb/>the land is  loamy. The land
    <lb/>in general is of a good quality, &amp;
    <lb/>a fine grass land; good springs
    <lb/>of water are scarce, as are lively
    <lb/><pb n="171" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_171"/>
    <lb/>running streams &amp; the waters fail
    <lb/>much in dry weather. In places
    <lb/>there are a plenty of coarse flinty limestone,
    <lb/>but in the general few stones are to be
    <lb/>seen; scarcely a spot to be met with, except
    <lb/>where it is clear’d, but what is very
    <lb/>heavily timber’d. I do not recollect
    <lb/>of ever passing thro’ a country that
    <lb/>has so large a proportion of clean, straight
    <lb/>beautiful white oaks, as a part of this
    <lb/>has; there are also a considerable quan-
    <lb/>tity of white &amp; black ash, poplar,
    <lb/>chesnut, elm, shellbark hickory, basswood
    <lb/>or lynn, sugar maple, beech, white pine
    <lb/>&amp; c. When the roads are first open’d
    <lb/>&amp; used they are mostly muddy, in
    <lb/>places very deep, but after they have
    <lb/>been used 8 or 10 years &amp; the roots rotten
    <lb/>&amp; gone, they get pretty good, tho’ at pres-
    <lb/>ent there are many deep places.
    <lb/><pb n="172" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_172"/>
    <lb/>As far as I can learn their summers
    <lb/>are pleasant, tho’ nearly, in the day-
    <lb/>time, as warm as our own are, but
    <lb/>the evenings &amp; nights mostly cool,
    <lb/>so that a blanket &amp; coverlit are not
    <lb/>often unpleasant sleeping under.
    <lb/>Their winters are steady, &amp;  more snow
    <lb/>lies on the ground than in our parts,
    <lb/>but in conversation with some who
    <lb/>moved out of the Jerseys &amp; <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvana</placeName>,
    <lb/>they were of the mind we have many
    <lb/>days here as cold as any they have
    <lb/>there, but we have more warm ones.
    <lb/>Their winters mostly set in towards
    <lb/>the middle of the 12th mo &amp; in the
    <lb/>forepart of winter they have frequent
    <lb/>snows until the ground becomes 18, 20,
    <lb/>or 24 inches deep, but seldom more,
    <lb/>which snow continues without much
    <lb/>addition until the middle of the
    <lb/><pb n="173" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_173"/>
    <lb/>3rd mo which is their pleasantest time
    <lb/>for travelling in the whole year; they
    <lb/>do their carting &amp; travelling much
    <lb/>with sleds, the roads become smooth
    <lb/>&amp; good, there are no swamps or mud
    <lb/>then in the way, neither is the snow
    <lb/>often soften’d with rain in the win-
    <lb/>ter; some seasons they have had
    <lb/>very little or no frost in the ground;
    <lb/>&amp; as far as they have tried clover, they
    <lb/>say it answers very well, not being
    <lb/>hurt in the winter with frost.
    <lb/>About 9 oclock in the morning we
    <lb/>look leave of our kind &amp; valued friends
    <lb/><persName key="ascho1">Asa Schooly</persName> &amp; wife, with their children,
    <lb/>having their, &amp; many friends hearty
    <lb/>wishes for our safe return. Stopped at
    <lb/><persName key="dpoun1">Daniel Pound’s</persName> a little while, then
    <lb/>taking our leave of them set off
    <lb/>down the lake for <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>, &amp; arrived
    <lb/><pb n="174" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_174"/>
    <lb/>at the ferry about 12 were we found the
    <lb/>chief ferryman so in liquor as not to
    <lb/>be fit to take any care, but a trusty
    <lb/>old man who sometimes assisted, agreed
    <lb/>to take us over. The wind was pretty
    <lb/>high, &amp; the river ran swift, he con-
    <lb/>cluded to lash the boats together
    <lb/>to keep the one our horses were in
    <lb/>steadier, which was very acceptable
    <lb/>to us, having found when we cross’d
    <lb/>before that it was a dangerous ferry, &amp;
    <lb/>rocking boat; but now on our return
    <lb/>we went over very steady, tho’ the
    <lb/>current beat us down the river ¾ of
    <lb/>a mile. Shortly after we got over &amp;
    <lb/>mounted, we saw a man at a great
    <lb/>distance towards <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>, coming
    <lb/>riding towards us, whom we presently
    <lb/>know to be our indian <persName key="checkplace">John</persName>, who was
    <lb/>coming to look for us, he appear’d
    <lb/><pb n="175" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_175"/>
    <lb/>much pleas’d to meet with us, as we did
    <lb/>to see him, &amp; to find that our mare was
    <lb/>safe we had left at <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName> in his care.
    <lb/>We got to Buffaloe about 2 Oclock, &amp;
    <lb/>tho’ a day later than we agreed to meet
    <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> here, yet neither he nor
    <lb/>any of his company were come. About
    <lb/>sun set his son Henry &amp; another indian
    <lb/>arrived, &amp; inform’d us that Cornplanter
    <lb/>&amp; 10 or 12 more were on their way, &amp;
    <lb/>would be here by 10 O clock to morrow.
    <lb/>15 miles.

  <p>About 12 oclock, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; his
    <lb/>company arrived at the opposite side

    <lb/>across, they appear’d pleas’d to see us,
    <lb/>Cornplanter enquiring after our
    <lb/>health since we left him, he gave us
    <lb/>a letter from our friends dated 5
    <lb/><pb n="176" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_176"/>
    <lb/>days after we came away, informing
    <lb/>they were well in health, &amp; enjoy’d a
    <lb/>peaceful mind; that they had got
    <lb/>their corn planted, &amp; were preparing
    <lb/>ground for potatoes; that there had
    <lb/>been much rain since we left them
    <lb/>&amp; that the gnats &amp; musquettos
    <lb/>were more troublesome than hereto-
    <lb/>fore. <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> having gotten
    <lb/>some information that we were a
    <lb/>little uneasy about staying, as none
    <lb/>of <persName key="rmorr1">Robt Morris’</persName> commissioners were
    <lb/>arrived; this afternoon he took an
    <lb/>opportunity with us observing that
    <lb/>he expected by this time we had
    <lb/>seen enough of the difficulty of
    <lb/>travelling in the wilderness, to know
    <lb/>that <del>where</del> people were to be collect’d
    <lb/>from different parts to do public
    <lb/>business, it requir’d time, &amp; he
    <lb/><pb n="177" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_177"/>
    <lb/>hoped that if <persName key="ichap1">captain Chapin</persName> should
    <lb/>not arrive this evening, we would try
    <lb/>to make ourselves as happy as we
    <lb/>could, &amp; stay a few days longer, for
    <lb/>he had a great desire we should
    <lb/>be with them at the council, &amp; see
    <lb/>that all things were settled fairly,
    <lb/>then we would be able to inform our
    <lb/>friends at home, &amp; if they were not set-
    <lb/>tled fairly we could also inform our
    <lb/>friends. It brought a close exercise
    <lb/>over our minds to know what was best
    <lb/>to do, a number of the indians were
    <lb/>collected, yet it look’d likely it would
    <lb/>be some time before all parties would
    <lb/>get together, as none of the white people
    <lb/>immediately concern’d were come.
    <lb/>We let them know we would have
    <lb/>been glad to attend the council, but it
    <lb/>was now drawing towards the end
    <lb/><pb n="178" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_178"/>
    <lb/>of the week, &amp; the white people did
    <lb/>not do business on first day, that it
    <lb/>was not very likely <persName key="ichap1">captain Chapin</persName>
    <lb/>&amp; c. would leave <placeName key="conan">Canandarque</placeName>.
    <lb/>before second day morning, &amp; that it
    <lb/>would be a number of days before the
    <lb/>council would meet; however we were
    <lb/>willing closely to consider the subject
    <lb/>this evening. The difficulty of find-
    <lb/>ing any suitable place for our horses,
    <lb/>was the principal cause that discour-
    <lb/>aged our staying.

  <p>Having attended to <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName>
    <lb/>request of last evening, I felt my mind
    <lb/>easy this morning to move homewards,
    <lb/>but upon mentioning it to my com-
    <lb/>panion he said he did not witness
    <lb/>that clearness to set out he wish’d to
    <lb/>experience, yet condescended, if I thought
    <lb/>best of letting the chief know, that
    <lb/><pb n="179" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_179"/>
    <lb/>upon weighing his request in the best
    <lb/>manner we could, we felt easy to move
    <lb/>homewards this morning. This infor-
    <lb/>mation was given him by walking
    <lb/>down to his encampment. He with
    <lb/>a number of other pretty soon came
    <lb/>up to our lodgings, &amp; let us know he
    <lb/>was sorry we could not make our
    <lb/>minds easy to stay a few days longer,
    <lb/>no ways doubting but <persName key="ichap1">captain Chapin</persName>
    <lb/>&amp; others concern’d would be here today;
    <lb/>but perhaps as we had been a consider-able time from home, &amp; living was
    <lb/>expensive we might be much run out
    <lb/>of the means that enabled us to stay,
    <lb/>which made us so anxious to return.
    <lb/>I inform’d him when I left home, I
    <lb/>expected to return in 40 days, that
    <lb/>it was now near 50 days, 6 if we went
    <lb/>by <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, to see the indians there
    <lb/><pb n="180" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_180"/>
    <lb/>which we propos’d, it would take near
    <lb/>30 days more before we could get
    <lb/>home, &amp; that our circumstances as to
    <lb/>money was not in the way, for we
    <lb/>had plenty. He said he had
    <lb/>left home on public business expect-
    <lb/>ing to return in 50 or 60 days, &amp; it
    <lb/>had taken him near a year before
    <lb/>he had gotten back, &amp; that he had
    <lb/>found it his duty to sacrifice pri-
    <lb/>vate conveniency to public good,
    <lb/>&amp; he would have us to do so too. we
    <lb/>let him know the business we came
    <lb/>about appear’d to be agreeably settled
    <lb/>to both their &amp; our minds, that the
    <lb/>other business was something we knew
    <lb/>nothing of until since among them
    <lb/>that we would have been willing to
    <lb/>have sat with them in council,
    <lb/>tho’ did not know we could be of

    <lb/>any service to them, &amp;that the business
    <lb/>between him &amp; <persName key="ichap1">captain Chapin</persName> relating
    <lb/>to a mill, we thought when he &amp; the
    <lb/>captain confer’d together on the subject
    <lb/>we might be fully inform’d of their
    <lb/>result by letter. He then inform’d
    <lb/>us he was become perfectly reconcil’d
    <lb/>to our going, &amp; as the council was
    <lb/>expected every day to meet, he could
    <lb/>not go with us to <placeName key="conan">Canandarque</placeName>, as
    <lb/>he had propos’d, but that <persName key="checkplace">John</persName>, who
    <lb/>had hitherto been with us, would go

    <lb/>wish’d the Good Spirit who had
    <lb/>hitherto preserv’d us, would safely keep

    <lb/>we would make ourselves perfectly
    <lb/>easy about our young men, who were
    <lb/>left among his people, for he would
    <lb/><pb n="182" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_182"/>
    <lb/>take care of them, &amp; that they would
    <lb/>be entirely safe. We now took an
    <lb/>affectionate farewell of the chief, and
    <lb/>of the indians present, who parted
    <lb/>with us with much respect; &amp; I can
    <lb/>truly say, the longer I have been
    <lb/>among that people, the more near
    <lb/>&amp; united they have felt to me, &amp; now
    <lb/>on parting they felt like bretheren
    <lb/>with whom I had been intimately
    <lb/>acquainted, &amp; for whose welfare I
    <lb/>feel ardent wishes. About 8 Oclock
    <lb/>we left <placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName>, having a fine
    <lb/>day to enter the wilderness, &amp; there
    <lb/>having been about a week of dry
    <lb/>weather, the road was this day pretty
    <lb/>good, so that with industry, we
    <lb/>travelled by computation 45 miles
    <lb/>much of this day’s ride was thro’ a
    <lb/>country very thinly timber’d, which
    <lb/><pb n="183" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_183"/>
    <lb/>was grown over with plenty of pretty
    <lb/>good grass, so that I thought
    <lb/>thousands of cattle might have <del>been</del>
    <lb/>fattened upon it, if it was not for
    <lb/>a certain species of large flies, and
    <lb/>musquettos; we stopp
    <lb/>d twice to let our
    <lb/>horses eat grass, but they were so wor-
    <lb/>ried with these insects that they
    <lb/>did little but run about, until we
    <lb/>got bushes &amp; kept them off; if we
    <lb/>stopp’d our horses one minuet in some
    <lb/>places in the woods the musquettos
    <lb/>would be on them in such swarms
    <lb/>as almost to hide their natural colour
    <lb/>&amp; none but those who have experienced
    <lb/>the trial can rightly form an idea,
    <lb/>how troublesome they were to the rider
    <lb/>I cover’d my head, neck, &amp; most of
    <lb/>my face with my silk handkerchief,
    <lb/>wrap’d my pocket do round one
    <lb/><pb n="184" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_184"/>
    <lb/>of my hands, &amp; with all the de-
    <lb/>fence I could make, was much
    <lb/>bit &amp; swell’d with them. When
    <lb/>night came we got no relief, we took
    <lb/>up our quarters about sunset,
    <lb/>beside a small stream of good water
    <lb/>under the boughs of an oak &amp;
    <lb/>erected fires in different places
    <lb/>around us in order to smoke them
    <lb/>off, but with all our defence we were
    <lb/>worried the whole night thro, so
    <lb/>that we slept but little; our horses,
    <lb/>as may readily be suppos’d, fared
    <lb/>no better, they would away out
    <lb/>to eating, &amp; then in a little time
    <lb/>return trotting back to the fire,
    <lb/>&amp; it was with difficulty we got
    <lb/>them saddled in the morning.
    <lb/>45 miles.

  <p>Set off early this morning being
    <lb/><pb n="185" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_185"/>
    <lb/>willing to leave Musquetto Camp: the
    <lb/>road not so good as yesterday, having
    <lb/>a large number of deep swamps, &amp;
    <lb/>about 20 miles of thick wood to pass
    <lb/>thro’, wherein we found no diminution
    <lb/>of the musquettos, but about noon we
    <lb/>arrived at the plains within 8 miles
    <lb/>of the <placeName key="genes2">Gnesee river</placeName>, where our horses
    <lb/>could eat grass, without much molesta-
    <lb/>tion, having left the big flys &amp; the
    <lb/>other tormenting insects chiefly behind
    <lb/>us. We cross’d the river about 4
    <lb/>on the flats of which there was a
    <lb/>great burden of natural grass, &amp;
    <lb/>about the road, timothy &amp; clover, the
    <lb/>seed having drop’d from horses as
    <lb/>they travelled along. I lodg’d at
    <lb/><persName key="npear1">Pearson’s</persName> 4 ½ miles on this side the river,
    <lb/>having left my companion a few miles
    <lb/>behind on special business. 35 miles
    <lb/><pb n="186" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_186"/>
    <lb/>The richness of the soil between
    <lb/><placeName key="buffa">Buffaloe</placeName> &amp; the <placeName key="genes2">Genoese river</placeName> is no way
    <lb/>lessen’d in my view by riding thro’
    <lb/>it at this time; but the first settlers
    <lb/>will meet with a great trial in the
    <lb/>summer time, from the insects I have
    <lb/>mention’d; but when the country
    <lb/>becomes settled, the low places clear’d
    <lb/>&amp; dry, that affliction I believe will
    <lb/>cease, for I saw very little Stagnated
    <lb/>water. Much of this country is
    <lb/>scarce of springs, or streams of water
    <lb/>&amp; what there is, very much fails in
    <lb/>dry seasons, so that its value will
    <lb/>be greatly lessen’d thereby.

  <p>About noon <persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName> arrived at

    <lb/>the captain express’d great satisfaction
    <lb/>with our proceedings, &amp; thought there
    <lb/>was encouragement to extend labour
    <lb/>towards that people, for he had been
    <lb/>some time past thro’ the <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> set-

    <lb/>thro’ a thick settled highly improv’d
    <lb/>country, considering the settlement
    <lb/>was no more than 10 years old, which
    <lb/>to me was very animating, having

    <lb/>not to be seen; here we had beauti-

    <lb/>constantly in view, with a good
    <lb/>appearance of wheat, indian corn,
    <lb/>flax, oats, &amp; c. these we shew’d to our

    <lb/>him the flax, that shirts &amp; c. are
    <lb/>made of, with which he appear’d
    <lb/>pleas’d. We saw 4 men hoeing
    <lb/>corn, these we pointed to, telling
    <lb/>him they were not squaws or
    <lb/>women, &amp; that was the way the white
    <lb/>people did their work; he knew our

 </div> <div type="entry">
  <dateline><date when="1798-06-21">21st</date></dateline>
  <p>Set off early this morning, pass’d
    <lb/>thro’ 3 miles of a light soil, thinly
    <lb/>timber’d, some of which was pitch-
    <lb/>pine, being the first we have seen
    <lb/>for several 100 miles past, then 8 or 9
    <lb/>miles thro’ a very rich beautiful
    <lb/><pb n="193" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_193"/>
    <lb/>limestone country, all thick woods; we
    <lb/>have now enter’d what is call’d the
    <lb/>military lands in <placeName key="onoco">Onandago county</placeName>,
    <lb/>&amp; I do not recollect of ever seeing 8 miles
    <lb/>of land more beautiful both for situ-
    <lb/>ation, &amp; quality, &amp; timber, than this.
    <lb/>As I rode over it I anticipated the
    <lb/>time, when this land will be crowded
    <lb/>with wealthy farmers, abounding with
    <lb/>large stocks of cattle &amp; c. vieing each
    <lb/>other with their fields of wheat, corn,
    <lb/>grass &amp; c. &amp; regaling themselves round
    <lb/>their tables, richly laden with provision.
    <lb/>Here we arrived at the outlet of <placeName key="senec">Seneca
    <lb/>lake</placeName>, a stream perhaps as large as three
    <lb/>of <placeName key="brand">Brandywine</placeName>; when we first came on
    <lb/>the river it look’d very deep, &amp; gliding
    <lb/>along with an easy current, but in a
    <lb/>little time we came to a rapid, a
    <lb/>mile in length, on which are erected
    <lb/><pb n="194" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_194"/>
    <lb/>an elegant merchant mill, &amp; a saw
    <lb/>mill that appear’d to do a great deal
    <lb/>of business; the stand is very valua-
    <lb/>ble, as the country round is fertile &amp;
    <lb/>suitable for raising wheat, Salt &amp;
    <lb/>goods of various kinds are boated
    <lb/>up this river, to a little below the
    <lb/>mill, then carted above the rapids,
    <lb/>&amp; from thence taken by boat into the
    <lb/><placeName key="senec">Seneca lake</placeName>, which is 40 miles in length
    <lb/>&amp; opens into a very fine country. We
    <lb/>were inform’d that this stream seldom
    <lb/>rises more than 6 inches with any
    <lb/>fresh, the lake forming a large basin
    <lb/>which contains it. Then to <placeName key="cayug">Cayuga
    <lb/>lake</placeName> 3 miles, here we fed our horses
    <lb/>&amp; cooked our own breakfast, we then
    <lb/>cross’d said lake in a boat, a little
    <lb/>above its outlet, it being one mile
    <lb/>wide, &amp; 13 or 14 feet deep. We were
    <lb/><pb n="195" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_195"/>
    <lb/>inform’d the lake is 45 miles long, &amp;
    <lb/>in places 4 miles wide; we now enter’d
    <lb/>a pretty thickly settled country, con-
    <lb/>siderably improv’d, the land still very
    <lb/>good, with plenty of limestone, &amp; in 8
    <lb/>miles cross’d a large lively stream,
    <lb/>being the outlet of <placeName key="owasc">Owasco lake</placeName>,
    <lb/>which lake is 12 miles long &amp; 1 broad,
    <lb/>about 1 ½ miles on this side we fed <del>our</del>
    <lb/><del>horses</del> at <persName key="checkplace">Goodrich’s</persName>, then to <persName key="checkplace">Carpenter’s</persName>
    <lb/>10 ½ miles over a very fine country, pretty
    <lb/>well water’d, which has not been the
    <lb/>case for many miles back, which country
    <lb/>was considerably settled, few of the im-
    <lb/>provements older than 4 years. I have
    <lb/>been much delighted in the last 15
    <lb/>miles’ ride, in beholding the beautiful
    <lb/>&amp; well grown fields of wheat, clooer, &amp;
    <lb/>timothy mix’d, &amp; lots of corn. I thought
    <lb/>one half of the clear’d land was in
    <lb/><pb n="196" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_196"/>
    <lb/>with grass, &amp; that many farmers
    <lb/>would cut from 20 to 30 tons of hay.
    <lb/>For 30 miles back I think it is with
    <lb/>out exception the best body of land
    <lb/>I have seen since we left home.
    <lb/>We got a five Oclock dinner at <persName key="mcarp1">Car-
    <lb/>penter’s</persName> &amp; then rode 6 miles further
    <lb/>to <persName key="checkplace">Lindsey’s</persName>, on <placeName key="9mile">9 mile creek</placeName>, a pretty
    <lb/>large stream, being the outlet of the
    <lb/><placeName key="checkplace">S           lake</placeName>. our last stage
    <lb/>mostly woods, lodged here, cutting clover
    <lb/>&amp; timothy for our horses with a sic-
    <lb/>kle, the grass so stout I thought
    <lb/>it would have produced nearly 3
    <lb/>tons of hay to the acre. The common
    <lb/>practice of raising corn, wheat &amp; c.
    <lb/>for many miles past, is to clear
    <lb/>a piece of ground by cutting down
    <lb/>nearly all the timber, which they
    <lb/>heap up &amp; burn on the spot,
    <lb/><pb n="197" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_197"/>
    <lb/>&amp; when made clean harrow the ground several
    <lb/>times over, then they plant &amp; tend the
    <lb/>corn with a hoe, never putting a
    <lb/>plow in the ground; when the corn
    <lb/>comes off in the fall, they again har-
    <lb/>row the ground several times, &amp; then
    <lb/>sow it with wheat &amp; timothy seed, &amp;
    <lb/>often times some clover, &amp; when the
    <lb/>wheat comes off, mow it for several years
    <lb/>by that time many of the roots are rotten,
    <lb/>they then plow &amp; farm it as suits best.

  <p>We went on foot this morning, <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob
    <lb/>Taylor</persName> bearing us company, to the <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora</orgName>
    <lb/>&amp; <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge Indians</orgName>, they lay south from
    <lb/>this place, up the <placeName key="onecr">Oneida creek</placeName>, the
    <lb/>Tuscaroras two miles off, &amp; the Stockbridge
    <lb/>4- The land is good with a considerable
    <lb/>bottom up the creek, on which the Tuscoro-
    <lb/>ras are scatteringly settled, most of them
    <lb/>having some enclosures of wheat, corn, mow-
    <lb/>ing ground &amp; c. with a considerable number
    <lb/>of cattle &amp; some horses, sheep, &amp; swine, which
    <lb/>made a pretty clever appearance; but on
    <lb/>arriving at the Stockbridge settlement, the
    <lb/><pb n="202" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_202"/>
    <lb/>prospect of their improvement was more
    <lb/>delightful; they have a large street be-
    <lb/>tween 2 &amp; 3 miles in length, which ascends
    <lb/>up the middle of a vally, one mile or
    <lb/>more in width; on each side of this
    <lb/>street their houses are erected 20 or 30
    <lb/>perches from each other, the land on
    <lb/>this street is mostly clear’d, &amp; fenc’d off
    <lb/>in small lots, which lots were in
    <lb/>with wheat, corn, &amp; grass, for mowing
    <lb/>or for pasture. It is about 9 years since
    <lb/>they settled here in the woods; their
    <lb/>first houses are mostly small &amp; poor,
    <lb/>some of them have latterly put up
    <lb/>pretty good houses, &amp; others are prepar-
    <lb/>ing for it; they have pretty good
    <lb/>gardens near their doors, &amp; considerable
    <lb/>stock of horses, oxen, cows, &amp; swine, with
    <lb/>some sheep, On the east, near enough
    <lb/>to supply them with water, runs the

    <lb/><placeName key="onecr">Oneida creek</placeName>, &amp; on the west, in the same
    <lb/>vally, a small stream, so that they are
    <lb/>well supplied with water; &amp; towards the
    <lb/>south end of their village they have a
    <lb/>grist mill &amp; a saw mill; their grist
    <lb/>mill does considerable work for the white
    <lb/>people, &amp; there was a large quantity of
    <lb/>logs &amp; boards at the saw mill both mills
    <lb/>are tended by Indians. We call’d to see
    <lb/>most of the families of note amongst them
    <lb/>also to see a school kept by a religious
    <lb/>Indian man, with whom I was much
    <lb/>pleas’d; many of the women were
    <lb/>solid, sensible, &amp; engaging; their houses
    <lb/>were clean, with wooden floors &amp; glass
    <lb/>windows; themselves &amp; families mostly clean
    <lb/>&amp; neat, &amp; the men &amp; boys were hoeing corn &amp; c
    <lb/>I thought there was as much difference
    <lb/>between <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName> people &amp; this nation
    <lb/>as between this people &amp; the better livers
    <lb/><pb n="204" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_204"/>
    <lb/>amongst the white people. We
    <lb/>had a favour’d opportunity with a
    <lb/>number of the most respectable cha-
    <lb/>racters of both their men &amp; women,
    <lb/>at the close of which, a chief on behalf
    <lb/>of the men present made a pretty lengthy
    <lb/>speech, in substance, expressing their
    <lb/>thankfulness to the Good Spirit who
    <lb/>had put it into our hearts to remember
    <lb/>them when at a great distance, &amp; had
    <lb/>preserv’d us in our way thither, that
    <lb/>they felt themselves strengthen’d by our
    <lb/>good words; that they were sensible they
    <lb/>had done that which was not right,
    <lb/>yet hoped by the help of the Good Spirit,
    <lb/>they would do better for the future, &amp;
    <lb/>they wish’d the Quakers would continue
    <lb/>to remember them, for they had found them
    <lb/>to be true men, &amp; that they really had
    <lb/>the poor Indian’s good at heart; &amp; wish’d
    <lb/><pb n="205" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_205"/>
    <lb/>the Good Spirit would safely preserve us
    <lb/>on our way home to our families &amp; friends
    <lb/>Then after a short pause, a woman, on
    <lb/>behalf of the women present, deliver’d a
    <lb/>speech much to the foregoing import,
    <lb/>tho’ we thought more weighty &amp; nervous
    <lb/>we then return’d to captain Hendrick’s
    <lb/>where we lodg’d, in a good clean bed.

  <p>Had a council with the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>
    <lb/>this afternoon, on business that our friends
    <lb/>here had been endeavouring to get them
    <lb/>together about for several weeks past, but
    <lb/>were not able to accomplish it until we
    <lb/>came, we made some fresh proposals to
    <lb/>them, concerning some of their young
    <lb/>men coming to work on the farm with
    <lb/>our friends, they never having complied
    <lb/><pb n="206" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_206"/>
    <lb/>with the proposals that were made
    <lb/>when the first went there, as the con-
    <lb/>sideration therein mention’d for their
    <lb/>labour they apprehended at too great a
    <lb/>distance, it being such a share of what
    <lb/>was rais’d. Thre were also some
    <lb/>proposals concerning one or two of their
    <lb/>young men coming to learn the smith
    <lb/>trade; all which they said they wou’d
    <lb/>take under consideration, &amp; let us know
    <lb/>to morrow, then they were closely expost-
    <lb/>ulated with concerning some jealousies
    <lb/>they had entertain’d occasion’d by some
    <lb/>whisperings of evil minded white
    <lb/>people, who told them the Quakers
    <lb/>had some deep rooted design, to get pos-
    <lb/>session of their lands, for they certainly
    <lb/>would not have been at the <del>pains</del>
    <lb/>great expence they have if they did
    <lb/>not expect some temporal advantage
    <lb/><pb n="207" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_207"/>
    <lb/>therefrom; they acknowledged they had
    <lb/>given too much place in their minds to
    <lb/>such whisperings, &amp; that it made them
    <lb/>feell, to use their own expressions “very
    <lb/>ugly”. We let them know we would
    <lb/>not have their land if they would
    <lb/>give it to us; &amp; that it was very un-
    <lb/>kind in them to have given place
    <lb/>to such surmisings without they had
    <lb/>had some grounds for it; they acknow-
    <lb/>ledged they had found us to be true
    <lb/>men, that we spoke the same words to
    <lb/>them now, we spoke to them two years
    <lb/>ago; &amp; that they would shut their ears
    <lb/>to all such whisperings in future;
    <lb/>then said they had been trying to
    <lb/>improve in farming &amp; if they did
    <lb/>not come forward as fast &amp; as well
    <lb/>as the Quakers desir’d, they must
    <lb/>not get discouraged, but continue
    <lb/><pb n="208" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_208"/>
    <lb/>their care &amp; assistance to them.
   </p><p>Upon enquiring of our young men
    <lb/>here, they inform’d us there was some
    <lb/>improvement among the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> since
    <lb/>they came, tho’ not such as they wish’d
    <lb/>to have seen; they plow more, &amp; fence
    <lb/>more, sow more wheat, &amp; have more
    <lb/>lots of <del>clover</del> meadow. They are
    <lb/>computed young &amp; old, at about 600
    <lb/>&amp; are scatter’d 10 or more miles distant
    <lb/>tho’ their largest number is within 2
    <lb/>miles of this place; They have a
    <lb/>large enclosure here of perhaps 200
    <lb/>acres, wherein they keep their horses,
    <lb/>of which they have more than necessary,
    <lb/>their cow, &amp; swine; &amp; in said enclosure
    <lb/>are many of their houses. They plant
    <lb/>their corn, sow their wheat &amp; oats, &amp; have
    <lb/>their meadow lots without; but this
    <lb/>mode of farming it looks likely they
    <lb/><pb n="209" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_209"/>
    <lb/>will have to change before long, for
    <lb/>they have sold their lands, particularly
    <lb/>where the state road goes within 2 or 3
    <lb/>miles of this place, &amp; the white people
    <lb/>are settling on it fast, who have put
    <lb/>several houses to the east &amp; west of
    <lb/>the castle &amp; we saw a number of cattle
    <lb/>in the woods within 2 miles of their
    <lb/>corn &amp; c. There are several good
    <lb/>houses in the castle with glass windows
    <lb/>&amp; piazzas or porticos before the door;
    <lb/>one of the chiefs house is painted
    <lb/>red, &amp; looks showy. The main road
    <lb/>from <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> to the Western country
    <lb/>goes thro’ their enclosure, there being a
    <lb/>gate hung on each side; many travellers
    <lb/>stop &amp; stay all night at the red house;
    <lb/>it is call’d a tavern. their houses are
    <lb/>generally floor’d, with chimneys at one
    <lb/>end.

  <p>Part of this afternoon was spent
    <lb/>with settling with the <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge
    <lb/>Indians</orgName> concerning the mill friends
    <lb/>had built them, &amp; in the evening
    <lb/>we had a council with the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>
    <lb/>in order for them to give us an
    <lb/>answer to the proposals we made
    <lb/>to them yesterday, they inform’d us they
    <lb/>had found one lad or young man
    <lb/>willing to come &amp; join in on the
    <lb/>farm, &amp; one to learn the smith trade,
    <lb/>&amp; the chiefs engaged to use their
    <lb/>endeavours to get more; they also agreed
    <lb/>immediately to cover a shop &amp; burn
    <lb/>some coals; which shop they accord-
    <lb/>ingly cover’d next morning, &amp; went
    <lb/>immediately to getting wood home
    <lb/>for coal; and the opportunity ended
    <lb/>to general satisfaction. It now looks
    <lb/>likely we may set off home tomorrow,
    <lb/><pb n="211" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_211"/>
    <lb/>which feels very pleasant. My mind
    <lb/>for the most part has been easy about
    <lb/>my family &amp; concerns at home ever since
    <lb/>I left them, but now our business ap-
    <lb/>pearing to be gone thro’ the draft
    <lb/>home feels strong; &amp; it has been some
    <lb/>exercise to our minds to fix on the
    <lb/>best route to take. Down the <placeName key="mohaw">Mohock
    <lb/>river</placeName>, by <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, &amp; thro’ the <placeName key="jerse">Jerseys</placeName> is
    <lb/>the best road, the oldest settled
    <lb/>country &amp; likely to have the best accom-
    <lb/>odations; but down the waters of the

  <p>Upon further consideration we fell most
    <lb/>easy to return home down the <placeName key="mohaw">Mohock
    <lb/>river</placeName>; And about one Oclock we look
    <lb/>an affectionate farewell of our friends
    <lb/>having before taken leave of the Indi-
    <lb/>ans, &amp; set off; we pass’d thro’ a thick
    <lb/>woods much of it hemlock, for 7 or 8
    <lb/><pb n="212" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_212"/>
    <lb/>miles, wherein there were a few
    <lb/>settlements lately erected, but as we
    <lb/>went on, improvements became more
    <lb/>plenty, so that in a few miles we got
    <lb/>into a thick settled country, with
    <lb/>large frame houses, many of which
    <lb/>were painted; &amp; good frame barns,
    <lb/>such as would have been a credit
    <lb/>to an old settled country, with fields
    <lb/>loaded with clover &amp; timothy for
    <lb/>mowing, some fields of wheat &amp; a very
    <lb/>good appearance of corn &amp; other spring
    <lb/>crops. In 17 miles we came to <placeName key="newha">New-
    <lb/>Hartford</placeName>, a smart town, containing a
    <lb/>number of good houses, among which
    <lb/>was a large place of worship, then
    <lb/>to the river at <placeName key="fschy">fort Schuyler</placeName> 4 miles,
    <lb/>where we pass’d thro’ another town
    <lb/>as large as <placeName key="newha">Hartford</placeName>, &amp; the buildings
    <lb/>good: here we cross’d the river, which
    <lb/><pb n="213" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_213"/>
    <lb/>I thought was not much larger than
    <lb/><placeName key="brand">Brandywine</placeName>, we then went down
    <lb/>the north side of said river, thro’ a
    <lb/>rich country thickly settled, to <persName key="checkplace">Braton’s</persName>
    <lb/>3 miles, where we got good accomodations
    <lb/>both for ourselves &amp; horses; farmers busy
    <lb/>mowing &amp; making hay today, the
    <lb/>first we have seen Grass so stout
    <lb/>scarcely room on the ground to dry it.
    <lb/>24 miles. Seventh day last
    <lb/>about 4 Oclock in the afternoon, while
    <lb/>we were at <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName>, a violent hail
    <lb/>storm pass’d thro’ the country a little
    <lb/>to the north of us, its direction was
    <lb/>nearly east, &amp; its extention 20 or more
    <lb/>miles, &amp; from one to two in breadth;
    <lb/>as we return’d to <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> next morning
    <lb/>we beheld its destructive effects on the
    <lb/>corn, oats &amp; c. and this day, for more
    <lb/>than 5 miles, it was affecting to see the
    <lb/><pb n="214" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_214"/>
    <lb/>destruction it made; whole fields of
    <lb/>wheat were entirely cut off, so that
    <lb/>we could not see one head standing
    <lb/>corn, flax, &amp; oats, far’d but little better,
    <lb/>peas, in the gardens &amp; fields, whole
    <lb/>acres being sown here, were entirely
    <lb/>destroy’d; large fields of timothy
    <lb/>were so broken down that they smell’d
    <lb/>like fresh hay; there being many <del>poke</del>
    <lb/>poke bushes along the road, which
    <lb/>were knock’d all to pieces, the stalks
    <lb/>which were as thick as rake handles
    <lb/>were broken; in short all vegetation
    <lb/>where the storm reach’d, suffer’d much
    <lb/>the fences, stumps, &amp; old logs, were much
    <lb/>mark’d; the windows of a number
    <lb/>of houses were very much destroy’d; one place

  <p>A fine morning, &amp; a pleasant
    <lb/><pb n="215" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_215"/>
    <lb/>day for travelling: about 8 or 9 miles
    <lb/>of a fine country down the river, tho’
    <lb/>poorly farm’d, buildings not near
    <lb/>so good as farther back, then 5 mile
    <lb/>to <persName key="checkplace">Aldriges</persName>, where we got our break-
    <lb/>fasts, thro’ land equally as good, &amp;
    <lb/>much better farmed, with some large
    <lb/>buildings; both spring &amp; winter wheat
    <lb/>good, also the corn; &amp; fine meadows
    <lb/>loaded with the best of grass; the
    <lb/>river at times close on our right, which
    <lb/>flow’d along with a gentle current,
    <lb/>appear’d pretty deep, tho’ not much
    <lb/><del>larger</del> wider than <placeName key="brand">Brandywine</placeName>; this was
    <lb/>thro’ what is call’d the <placeName key="gefla">German Flats</placeName>.

    <lb/><placeName key="checkplace">Hackamack</placeName>, &amp; so over the river on a
    <lb/>bridge to the south side one mile
    <lb/>before we fed: then 14 miles to <persName key="checkplace">Treeven

    <lb/><pb n="216" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_216"/>
    <lb/>buildings mostly poor, as was also
    <lb/>the grass, &amp; other crops; we now
    <lb/>left the river at some distance to
    <lb/>our left. About 3 miles back
    <lb/>we went by a pretty elegant house,

    <lb/>which had increas’d much in width,
    <lb/>the flat still continuing, in one mile
    <lb/>we left it, &amp; pass’d over 6 or 7 miles
    <lb/>of a stony, rough, poor country, except
    <lb/>some bottoms on the river, the

  <p>A pleasant ride 2 or more miles
    <lb/>down a rich bottom all under culture.
    <lb/>The scarcity of rail timber has in-
    <lb/>duced many farmers on this river
    <lb/>to hang gates at certain places
    <lb/>instead of fencing each side of the
    <lb/>road, so that corn, wheat, peas &amp; c.
    <lb/>come close up to the road side, which
    <lb/>causes a delightful appearance where
    <lb/>crops are good. From thence to <persName key="checkplace">De-
    <lb/>graph’s</persName> 17 ½ miles; this stage the
    <lb/>land mostly stony, some of it very
    <lb/>rough, &amp; but little bottom land on
    <lb/>the river; the buildings mean &amp;
    <lb/>farming poor. I have often ad-
    <lb/>mired since we came on this river
    <lb/>to see such large heaps of ashes
    <lb/><pb n="219" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_219"/>
    <lb/>remaining untouched, where there has
    <lb/>been for years past, pot ash manufacto-
    <lb/>ries carried on; they convey to the trav-
    <lb/>eller that the people have no idea
    <lb/>the land would be benefited by spread-
    <lb/>ing them over it, or otherwise that
    <lb/>they are too lazy to do it: a few
    <lb/>miles back some men were hoeing very
    <lb/>poor corn in a field where I had no
    <lb/>doubt but there were 3 or 400 loads
    <lb/>of ashes in a heap untouch’d; I call’d
    <lb/>aloud to them to know why they did
    <lb/>not spread that heap of ashes over
    <lb/>the field, &amp; so have good corn, &amp; not be
    <lb/>hoeing such poor stuff as that was;
    <lb/>they stood like men amazed, made no
    <lb/>reply, &amp; we pass’d on; and a few
    <lb/>miles further we saw a large pot ash
    <lb/>works close on the river, so that when
    <lb/>the ashes were thrown out of the
    <lb/><pb n="220" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_220"/>
    <lb/>tubs they went into the river &amp; were

    <lb/>but few streams of consequence running
    <lb/>into the river since we left <placeName key="fschy">Fort
    <lb/>Schuyler</placeName>, yet it has increas’d very
    <lb/>much in width. Where we lodg’d
    <lb/>last night, our landlord said it was
    <lb/>60 yards wide, in many places since
    <lb/>I suppos’d it to be from 100 to 150
    <lb/>&amp; at Schenectady where we ferry’d
    <lb/>it, we were inform’d it was 60
    <lb/>perches wide. The town made a
    <lb/>pretty appearance from the opposite
    <lb/>shore; it was situated on the south
    <lb/>side of the river, appear’d to be
    <lb/>a considerable place, with many
    <lb/><pb n="221" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_221"/>
    <lb/>good buildings. We did not stop in
    <lb/>the town, desiring to go where we
    <lb/>could get grass for our horses, &amp;
    <lb/>understanding there were plenty of
    <lb/>taverns on towards <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, we pro-
    <lb/>ceeded forward; but we found the
    <lb/>country was too poor to produce good
    <lb/>grass, for it was a perfect sand bed
    <lb/>except some swamps, nearly all the
    <lb/>way to Albany, a very large town on
    <lb/>the <placeName key="nrive">North river</placeName>, &amp; thinly timber’d
    <lb/>with pitch pine, &amp; as thinly inhabited,
    <lb/>being but 10 or 12 houses for 15 miles,
    <lb/>&amp; each of them a tavern. When
    <lb/>evening came we, were hard put to
    <lb/>for good quarters. Within 1 ½ miles
    <lb/>of Albany, we found at the widow
    <lb/><persName key="ascot1">Scott’s</persName>, pretty good pasture, but the
    <lb/>house &amp; things in it look’d very
    <lb/>discouraging; however we fared better
    <lb/><pb n="222" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_222"/>
    <lb/>than we expected. This has been
    <lb/>a trying day’s ride; the road was
    <lb/>dusty &amp; the wind with us, so that
    <lb/>we were much smother’d. 45 miles

  <p>In 1 ½ miles we arrived at <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>,
    <lb/>the town stands on the west side of
    <lb/>the north river under a hill, so
    <lb/>that we had but little prospect of it,
    <lb/>until we came close by. We did
    <lb/>not stop in the town, riding in at
    <lb/>the west side, &amp; out at the south end.
    <lb/>Shortly after we left the city we
    <lb/>pass’d by two beautiful country seats,
    <lb/>on commanding eminences to our
    <lb/>right, the fruit trees around them,
    <lb/>the descending green meadows before
    <lb/>their doors, &amp; the river which was in
    <lb/>full view, render’d their situation
    <lb/>very enchanting. We now pursued
    <lb/>our course down the river, having

    <lb/>it at times in view, to <placeName key="checkplace">Quemanstown</placeName>,
    <lb/>15 miles, where we got a good break-
    <lb/>fast. A few miles on this side <placeName key="alban">Al-
    <lb/>bany</placeName>, the land was a stony gravel,
    <lb/>with a hard clay; then sandy; The
    <lb/>whole of the way poor, thinly settled,
    <lb/>&amp; buildings mean; mostly a pitch
    <lb/>pine timber. Then to <placeName key="catsk1">Katskill</placeName>
    <lb/>18 miles; the first 3 or 4 rough &amp; stony;
    <lb/>then 8 or 10 miles <del>further</del> through an
    <lb/>old settled country; pretty level fields
    <lb/>without pasture, meadows very light;
    <lb/>wheat, rye, cheat, &amp; some cochle, mix’d
    <lb/>together, made their winter crop; the
    <lb/>land a stiff clay, in dry weather it
    <lb/>bakes very hard; the remainder of
    <lb/>this stage full of limestone ridges, &amp;
    <lb/>so stony as not to be arable. <placeName key="catsk2">Catskill</placeName>
    <lb/>a large stream with a very rocky

    <lb/><pb n="224" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_224"/>
    <lb/>a dutch tavern, where we lodged
    <lb/>12 ½ miles. In about 2 miles we
    <lb/>cross’d a stream call’d the <placeName key="checkplace">Katerskill</placeName>,
    <lb/>on a high bridge, just below which
    <lb/>there was a remarkable fall of 30 or
    <lb/>more feet, over a huge pile of rocks,
    <lb/>which damed the water for miles
    <lb/>back, &amp; form’d a very fine mill seat,
    <lb/>on which were erected a merchant
    <lb/>&amp; saw mill; From thence to this
    <lb/>place the land continued very
    <lb/>much broken with high limestone
    <lb/>ridges, running in a southern di-
    <lb/>rection. Much high land was
    <lb/>to be seen in this day’s ride; we
    <lb/>often had a full view of many
    <lb/>miles extent over the <placeName key="nrive">North river</placeName>,

  <p>We would have
    <lb/>been glad to have reach’d a friend’s meet-
    <lb/>ing to day, but found it imprac-
    <lb/>ticable, therefore thought best of
    <lb/>travelling, tho’ not without some
    <lb/>unpleasant feelings, being in a
    <lb/>Presbyterian country. Early
    <lb/>this morning we pass’d thro’ two
    <lb/>considerable red cedar groves, on rocky
    <lb/>poor land; then through pretty
    <lb/>good land, &amp; thickly settled, though
    <lb/>very much broken with limestone
    <lb/>ridges. In 10 miles we cross’d <placeName key="esocr">Eusopas
    <lb/>creek</placeName>, a small stream larger than
    <lb/><placeName key="brand">Brandywine</placeName>; fine bottoms up the
    <lb/><pb n="226" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_226"/>
    <lb/>creek to the town which is a
    <lb/>large village containing many
    <lb/>good buildings, We pass’d through
    <lb/>the skirts of the town, &amp; in about 4
    <lb/>miles of stony rough land, got to
    <lb/><placeName key="green">Greenskill</placeName>; here we took our break-
    <lb/>fast at <persName key="gdewi">De Witt’s</persName>, in a rocky country.
    <lb/>He has a merchant mill near by,
    <lb/>on the most natural dam &amp; fall
    <lb/>I think I ever saw. There is a
    <lb/>ridge of rocks runs across the kill,
    <lb/>&amp; on each side of which is firm
    <lb/>land, one end of the mill head,
    <lb/>which conveys the water on the
    <lb/>wheels, rests on these rocks, from
    <lb/>which to the opposite shore is but 10
    <lb/>feet; the miller told me that by
    <lb/>putting an eigteen inch board, on
    <lb/>the top of about 18 inches already
    <lb/>rais’d, on the ridge of rocks, he
    <lb/><pb n="227" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_227"/>
    <lb/>could pen water enough, if it met
    <lb/>with no supply, to keep the mill
    <lb/>going for 3 days. Then thro’ a
    <lb/>rough country, tho’ good roads.
    <lb/>In about 18 miles we arrived at <persName key="sbald1">Saml
    <lb/>Baldwin’s</persName>. In 4 or more miles of
    <lb/>the first part of this stage, we
    <lb/>cross’d the <placeName key="checkplace">Rosendell</placeName>, a lively stream
    <lb/>nearly as large as <placeName key="esocr">Eusopas</placeName>, the
    <lb/>bridge over it was perhaps fifty yards
    <lb/>long, &amp; 20 feet from the water, yet
    <lb/>the stream rose so high a few months
    <lb/>ago, as to be on the bridge. In
    <lb/>perhaps 4 miles further we came
    <lb/>to the <placeName key="wallk">Wallkill</placeName>, which was as large
    <lb/>as three of the Rosendall, &amp; into
    <lb/>which the Rosendall runs a few miles
    <lb/>below. We went several miles up
    <lb/>the Wallkill thro’ a fine level country
    <lb/>&amp; cross’d it in a boat, it was perhaps
    <lb/><pb n="228" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_228"/>
    <lb/>60 or 70 yards wide, &amp; 10 feet deep.
    <lb/>There appear’d to be no current
    <lb/>in the river, occasion’d by a ridge
    <lb/>of rocks that runs across it 5 or 6
    <lb/>miles below, over which the water
    <lb/>falls 20 or more feet. From what
    <lb/>I have seen as well as heard; falls
    <lb/>of this kind are very common on
    <lb/>many of the waters of this part of the coun-
    <lb/>try. As we advanced Southward,
    <lb/>the land improv’d in quality, &amp;
    <lb/>the wonderful ridges of rocks that
    <lb/>were so very common further back,
    <lb/>grew fewer, yet stones rather increas’d,
    <lb/>tho’ most of the land in the latter
    <lb/>part of this stage is arable, more espe-
    <lb/>cially after the stones are drawn off,
    <lb/>which in divers places had been done
    <lb/>&amp; put up in stone fences. Plaister
    <lb/>of Paris has been latterly introduced
    <lb/><pb n="229" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_229"/>
    <lb/>into these parts &amp; answers very well
    <lb/>We arrived at <persName key="sbald1">Saml Baldwins</persName> about
    <lb/>4 oclock, weary &amp; glad we <del>were</del> had got
    <lb/>to a friend’s house. The weather

    <lb/>having travelled hard from <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>,
    <lb/>both we &amp; our horses wanted rest
    <lb/>we concluded to lay by here a day or
    <lb/>two, in order to get them shoed, &amp; to
    <lb/>help their backs, which were chaffed

    <lb/>having at times for some weeks past,
    <lb/>hinted to me, that he had some wish
    <lb/>before we return’d home to go over the
    <lb/><placeName key="nrive">North river</placeName> to see the school at <placeName key="9part1">Nine
    <lb/>Partners</placeName>, but since we left Oneida, our
    <lb/>draft homewards having been such that
    <lb/>we had put it by, on our arrival here,

    <lb/>of said school, &amp; <persName key="sbald1">Saml Baldwin</persName>
    <lb/><pb n="230" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_230"/>
    <lb/>kindly offering to let us have fresh
    <lb/>horses, &amp; to take good care of our own
    <lb/>until we return’d, we felt easy upon
    <lb/>weighing the proposal, in attempting
    <lb/>to go. 36 miles.

  <p>Accordingly this morning, we went
    <lb/>9 miles nearly on an East direction
    <lb/>to <persName key="ehall1">Edwd Hallock’s</persName> near the North
    <lb/>river, over a very rough, stony coun-
    <lb/>try; about one mile before we got
    <lb/>to Edward’s, off some high land, we
    <lb/>had a very beautiful &amp; extensive
    <lb/>prospect, for about 20 miles over the
    <lb/><placeName key="nrive">North river</placeName>, &amp; as far each way
    <lb/>up &amp; down the water. The face
    <lb/>of the country appearing to descend
    <lb/>towards the river, &amp; being mostly
    <lb/>improv’d, the wheat &amp; pasture
    <lb/>fields, together with large houses,

    <lb/><pb n="231" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_231"/>
    <lb/>which presented in places, also the
    <lb/>town of <placeName key="pough">Poughkeepsie</placeName>, which was 4
    <lb/>miles up the river, on its opposite
    <lb/>shore, made the landscape truly
    <lb/>delightful. We dined at <persName key="ehall1">Edwd

    <lb/>warm, &amp; our horses young, not suit-
    <lb/>able for travelling such weather,
    <lb/>we thought it would be best not
    <lb/>to proceed further, therefore in the

 </div> <div type="entry">

  <p>Set off early this morning thro’
    <lb/>a pretty good country, &amp; fine roads
    <lb/>to <persName key="checkplace">Jackson’s</persName> 18 miles, here we fed our
    <lb/><pb n="232" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_232"/>
    <lb/>horses &amp; got a second breakfast.
    <lb/>We pass’d by four large places of
    <lb/>worship this morning; &amp; a number
    <lb/>of good houses &amp; barns; The land
    <lb/>level &amp; clear of stones. A chain of
    <lb/>mountains was steadily in view
    <lb/>on our right at 10 or more miles
    <lb/>distance; &amp; we left <placeName key="newbu">Newburgh</placeName>,
    <lb/>&amp; <placeName key="nwind">New Windsor</placeName>, 8 or 10 miles to
    <lb/>our left. More swamp meadow
    <lb/>for the last 14 miles than for 100
    <lb/>before. A large proportion of the land
    <lb/>was sown with wheat, which was
    <lb/>mostly light. Not so much rye as
    <lb/>farther back. Then thro’ good
    <lb/>land thick settled, &amp; a beautiful
    <lb/>country to <placeName key="goshe">Goshen</placeName>, the county town
    <lb/>of <placeName key="orang">Orange county</placeName>. Off a command-
    <lb/>ing eminence, a few miles before
    <lb/>we got to the village, we had an
    <lb/><pb n="233" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_233"/>
    <lb/>extensive prospect to the West,
    <lb/>to the South &amp; to the East; I expect
    <lb/>the eye reach’d 20 miles each way,
    <lb/>over a level looking country, much
    <lb/>improved. In the neighbourhood
    <lb/>of this village lies a large proportion
    <lb/>of valuable meadows; &amp; shortly after
    <lb/>we left the town, I observ’d all the
    <lb/>fences, both post &amp; rail, &amp; worm fences,
    <lb/>were made of nice cedar rails; &amp; upon
    <lb/>enquiry I was informed that in
    <lb/>what is call’d the drowned lands,
    <lb/>there is a cedar swamp of several
    <lb/>thousand acres, which supplies all
    <lb/>the country for a number of miles
    <lb/>round. A very valuable source.
    <lb/>In 6 miles, over land more rough
    <lb/>&amp; hilly, we got to <placeName key="flori">Florida</placeName>; a place
    <lb/>of several good buildings, where we
    <lb/>fed. Water for our horses to drink

    <lb/>where we lodged, over a hilly, stony
    <lb/>country; a great abundance of
    <lb/>limestone the latter part of this
    <lb/>stage. Rye is the most common
    <lb/>winter grain. We are now
    <lb/>in the <placeName key="jerse">Jerseys</placeName>, 3 or 4 miles South
    <lb/>of the <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> line; having trav-

 </div> <div type="entry">

  <p>This has been the worst stage
    <lb/>for our horses, that we have met with
    <lb/>since we left <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, &amp; not very good
    <lb/>for ourselves. Went to <persName key="checkplace">Dr Beech’s</persName>
    <lb/>7 miles to breakfast, a very good
    <lb/>stage. Our last 7 miles was thro’
    <lb/>a rough country, a considerable
    <lb/>mountain on our left, &amp; a vally on

    <lb/>stoney. stone fences <del>very</del> pretty frequent.
    <lb/>The farmers have been very busy
    <lb/>for this week past, in plowing &amp;
    <lb/>hoeing their corn, &amp; in plowing
    <lb/>for buckwheat, a large quantity of
    <lb/>this grain being sown hereaway.
    <lb/>A few crops of good wheat are to be
    <lb/>seen, but light crops of rye are
    <lb/>more frequent. A Dutch plow
    <lb/>with one handle which stands
    <lb/>nearly upright, with a very short
    <lb/>beam &amp; pan share, is almost the
    <lb/>only plow that is used for 200
    <lb/>miles back; They appear to work
    <lb/>easy both to the plowman &amp; horses;
    <lb/>&amp; it does their business pretty neatly.
    <lb/>Shortly after we left this stage
    <lb/>we cross’d the <placeName key="wallk">Wallkill</placeName> 60 miles
    <lb/>higher up than where we cross’d
    <lb/>it first day last; yet the stream
    <lb/><pb n="236" facs="hv_js_account_visit_1798_236"/>
    <lb/>was so large here as to have a
    <lb/>forge erected on it a little above
    <lb/>the fording place. In about
    <lb/>7 miles further we cross’d the
    <lb/><placeName key="pauli">Pawlinskill</placeName>, which was the first
    <lb/>water we cross’d. That ran into
