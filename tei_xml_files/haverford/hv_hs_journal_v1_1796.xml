                  <lb/>Children all the year round, that you might not suf
                  <lb/>fer for the want of it; as I believe you oftten do, throâ€™
                  <lb/>your own Idleness &amp; Drunkenness.
                 </p><p>Brothers, I suppose you remember that some of your
                  <lb/>Friends the Quakers who paid you a visit Last Summer
                  <lb/>proposed to send you some Impliments of Husbandry, in
                  <lb/>order to encourage you to work, that you may in time
                  <lb/>become good Farmers. I have now brought them, &amp;
                  <lb/>all we want for them or for our trouble, is your careful
                  <lb/>attention to what we Say to you, that is, that you
                  <lb/>go to work with them clear and Plow your Land as
                  <lb/>fast as you can, So you may have plenty of food to
                  <lb/>Subsist upon; So that ye are kind to Each other &amp;
                  <lb/>lend these Tools and encourage one another to work
                  <lb/>and persuad one another from Drinking Rum &amp;
                  <lb/>getting Drunk. Oh how Sorry I have been to see

                  <lb/><pb n="25" facs="hv_hs_journal_v1_1796_025"/>
                  <lb/>see the Poor Indians laying about the ground Drunk, instead
                  <lb/>of being on your Land at work. And it is very displ-
                  <lb/>easing to the Great Good Spirit. you should not spend
                  <lb/>your Money for Rum, you should buy Horses Chattles &amp;
                  <lb/>other useful articles with it to work your Land with,
                  <lb/>and Clotheing to keep you warm in cold weather
                 </p><p>Now Brothers
                  <lb/>If you do not use those Tools nor try
                  <lb/>to be Farmers, but continue on in your Drunken Idle way
                  <lb/>of Living, eltting your wives &amp; women do all the work
                  <lb/>for you. Dont you think your friends the Qua-
                  <lb/>kers, will be discouraged from helping you anymore,
                  <lb/>I fear they will, Therefore I want you to be enco-
                  <lb/>raged &amp; persuaded to work your Land, Perhaps in
                  <lb/>a few years, through your industry and Care, you
                  <lb/>may be good Farmers, and good Houskeepers, which
                  <lb/>will add much more to your comfortable way of
                  <lb/>Living, than the methods you are now in.

                  <lb/>after a pause, they began their speech, after this manner
                  <lb/>that they remembered what the Quakers said to them
                  <lb/>Last summer, and what I had said too them now Corri-
                  <lb/>sponded, so that they thought they perfectly underst-
                  <lb/>ood what our intention was, and they now felt thank-
                  <lb/>ful for our help and assistance.

                  They said the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> had a double previledg to

                  <lb/>but they had no Learning but what nature had Lea-
                  <lb/>rnt them. but yet they where willing to take hold
                  <lb/>and do what they could, but that of Drinking Rum
                  <lb/>&amp; getting Drink, they Said they thought they could
                  <lb/>not keep from it, because it was running all round
                  <lb/>them, that they now lived on an Island, and the wh-
                  <lb/>ite People would give them Drams &amp; then they cra-
                  <lb/>ved more, So that they thought it was impossi-
                  <lb/>ble to leave it off; as they had so long been accustom-
                  <lb/>ed to it; but they where in hopes the young Peo-

                  <lb/>ple would learn better. However they Said
                  <lb/>they would use those Impliments as well as they could, or
                  <lb/>words to the same perport. The Counsel broke up
                  <lb/>I Delivered them all the articles and told them how
                  <lb/>to fix &amp; use them. And requested some of their Sober Peo-
                  <lb/>ple to take &amp; Devide them amongst their Nation.
              </p><p>
                  I proposed to them to Layout Some of their Anu-
                  <lb/>ity for a grindstone, to grind there Tools; And they
                  <lb/>agreed to do so, and <persName key="ewebs1">Ephraim Webster</persName> said he would
                  <lb/>get it for them &amp; charge them nothing for his trouble;
