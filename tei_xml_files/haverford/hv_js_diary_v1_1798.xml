   <p>Friday left our habita-
    <lb/>tions after experiencing a humbling time in pasting
    <lb/>with our families &amp; connections &amp; were accompanied
       <lb/>from home, by <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName>, who called on us,
    <lb/>&amp; next day we were met by <persName key="hjack1">Halliday Jackson</persName> &amp; <persName key="jswai1">Joel
    <lb/>Swayne</persName> at the House of <persName key="agibb1">Abrm Gibbons</persName>, whence
    <lb/>we all went <del>off</del> out about two in the afternoon, &amp; after se-

    <lb/>Cadwalliders</persName> in <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName> where we rested ourselves
    <lb/>&amp; horses about two days, attended their meeting and
    <lb/>then proceeded on to <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName> where we arrived
    <lb/><date when="1798-05-10">5th Mo. 10th</date> about noon.
   </p><p>Soon after our arrival in this place we waited
    <lb/>on <persName key="abark1">Abner</persName> &amp; <persName key="jbark1">Jesse Barker</persName> to whose case our Goods
    <lb/>had been consign’d from whom we learn, that they
    <lb/>came safe to them, two days since &amp; are lodged in the
    <lb/>public stores; &amp; that the Articles which they were
    <lb/>particularly directed to provide are in readiness

    <lb/>expecting the Cart, which we adjudge not necessary,
    <lb/>as sledges are more common, &amp; often more convenient,
    <lb/>in new countries; We also presented our letter of Credit
    <lb/>on them, from <persName key="tfish1">Thomas Fisher</persName> &amp; <persName key="pbark1">Peter Barker</persName>, with
    <lb/>the contents of which, the said <persName key="abark1">Abner</persName>/<persName key="jbark1">Jesse</persName> not being
    <lb/>at home/expressed the greatest readiness to comply
    <lb/>and to afford us every assistance in his power, rela-
    <lb/>tive to our business.
   </p><p>We next waited on <persName key="checkplace">Dr. Geo Stevenson</persName>, presented
    <lb/>to him <persName key="twist1">Thomas Wisters</persName> letter of similar import
    <lb/>with the above, with the contents whereof, he also
    <lb/>manifested a perfect willingness to comply, &amp; take
    <lb/>otherwise assistant to us as occasion might offer,
    <lb/>expressing at the same time, in liberal terms his
    <lb/>sentiments of the laudibleness of the undertaking
    <lb/>in which we were engaged.
   </p><p>We afterwards in company with the said <persName key="abark1">A
    <lb/>Barker</persName> &amp; Dr Stevenson, had a satisfactory confer-
    <lb/>ence with <persName key="icrag1">I<del>srael</del>saac Craig</persName> Dep. Quarter Master from
    <lb/>whom we learn that he has rec’d no orders from the Se-
    <lb/>cretary of War relative to the forwarding our Goods
    <lb/>up the <placeName key="alleg">Allegany</placeName>; but that <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson</persName> had
    <lb/>directed him to assist us in that way. He also mani-

    <lb/>fested an obliging &amp; attentive disposition relative to

    <lb/>morrow for the purpose, &amp; kindly offerd to introduce
    <lb/>us to <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson</persName>, as early in the morning
    <lb/>as would be convenient.
   </p><p>We next paid attention to procuring such
    <lb/>Articles of provisions &amp; as appeared necessary hav-
    <lb/>ing been informed at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>, that no advantage
    <lb/>would be derived from purchasing them in that neigh-
    <lb/>bourhood or any where short of this place.
   </p><p>The following Articles were agreed to be necessary
    <lb/>&amp; accordingly provided vizr.
   </p><p>4 ½ bus. Potatoes, 3 Barrels wheat flour 2 Do

   <p>This morning in company with

   </p><p>After this conference, some of our number accompani-
    <lb/>ed the Quarter Master to look for a boatsman, whilst
    <lb/>others attended to the necessary arrangements in order
    <lb/>to prepare our Goods for going on board.
   </p><p>About three in the afternoon, a board was in rea-
    <lb/>diness &amp; the Quartermaster furnishing a waggon, we
    <lb/>soon got our goods collected to the water side, weighed
    <lb/>&amp; put on board amounting in the whole to 4734 lb
    <lb/>for which, we understand the Boatman is to receive

   <p>After the rec’t of these letters, we took leave
    <lb/>of the General, who accompanied us in person thro’
    <lb/>the guards, &amp; it may be proper to note that in our
    <lb/>conference he greatly insinuated a cautionary hint
       <lb/>respecting the private character of <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, that he was sufficiently
    <lb/>possessed of the Idea of distinct private property, &amp;
    <lb/>pretty artful in adopting measures to his own interests.

    <lb/>a parcel of indians, most of whom were in liquor &amp;

    <lb/>to have the command at this place, soon put a stop
    <lb/>to this business, at least for the present; &amp; he inform’d

    <lb/>through a very rough wilderness country about 15

    <lb/>which is not distinguishable from others in the vil-

    <lb/>our horses carrying in our baggage &amp; we seated
    <lb/>ourselves &amp; Cornplanter, his Son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName> &amp; several others
    <lb/>came &amp; sat down with us &amp; after a short pause Corn-
    <lb/>planter expressed his glad ness to see us (his son Henry
    <lb/>being Interpreter) &amp; his thankfulness to the great Spirit
    <lb/>that
        <lb/><pb n ="13" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_013"/>
    <lb/>that we had been preserved on our journey so as to
    <lb/>arrive safe, and asked us if we would wish to have
    <lb/>a general council with his people, &amp; when it would
    <lb/>suit us to have it. We inform’d him we should
    <lb/>like to see them in council tomorrow, if they could
    <lb/>be collected by that time, which was agreed to, and
    <lb/>runners dispatched immediately for <del>the</del> that purpose, he
    <lb/>then quesied of us, if we could eat Indian fashion &amp;
    <lb/>upon our answering we could, we were soon presented
    <lb/>with a number of large Indian dumplings, boiled
    <lb/>in cornhusks &amp; sewed up in a bark dish, together
    <lb/>with a small kettle of Bean Oil to dip the dum
    <lb/>pling in as we ate it, this completed our dinner, &amp;
    <lb/>notwithstanding its simplicity we were utterly at
    <lb/>a loss what to do with it, or how to beg in: we saw
    <lb/>the kettle of Oil, but knew not how we were to eat
    <lb/>it, we saw the Bunches of corn husks in the bark dish,
    <lb/>but knew not what was in them nor how to come at it
    <lb/>we knew not whether our two dishes were to be taken
    <lb/>separate or together, at length after some interrogations
    <lb/>amongst ourselves we explained our difficulty to
    <lb/>the Chief who thereupon took his knife cut open one
    <lb/>of the dumplings &amp; taking off a small piece stuck
    <lb/>the
        <lb/><pb n ="14" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_014"/>
    <lb/>the point of his knife into it, kiped it into the Kettle
    <lb/>of Oil &amp; ate it, we followed his example &amp; made
    <lb/>a temperate meal.
   </p><p>The name of this village is <placeName key="jenuch">Jenuchshadaga</placeName>, it is
    <lb/>situate on the <placeName key="alleg">Allegany</placeName> in <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> about 4
    <lb/>Miles below the <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName> line; the Land is Corn-

   </p><p>This evening after we were lain down <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName>
    <lb/>son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName> came to us &amp; informed, his father would be glad
    <lb/>to hear what we had to say to them before the council met

    <p>Agreeably to the proposals of last evening
        <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, his Son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName>, &amp; one or two more, came
    <lb/>into our lodging Apartment early in the morning to
    <lb/>hear what we intended to say to them in council, we
    <lb/>let
        <lb/><pb n ="15" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_015"/>
    <lb/>let them know that we could not tell them all that
    <lb/>we should say to them in the Council, for we thought
    <lb/>it right to wait to feel the good spirit influence
    <lb/>our hearts to speak to our Indian Brothers, but that
    <lb/>we would read them our letter from our friends, in
    <lb/><placeName key="phila">philada</placeName> with which they appeared to be satisfied. The
    <lb/>letter was accordingly read by paragraphs &amp; inter-
    <lb/>preted by <persName key="abeel">henry Obeal</persName> as also that of <persName key="gwilk2">General
    <lb/>Wilkinson</persName>.
   </p><p>bout 12 OClock, the Indians being generally
    <lb/>collected, we sat down in council &amp; after a short
       <lb/>silence <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> opened the business by a short
    <lb/>speech, expressing the joy they felt when they saw
    <lb/>us coming through the bushes yesterday; and their
    <lb/>thankfulness to the great spirit that we were arrived
    <lb/>safe, he then mention’d our request of yesterday, to
    <lb/>see his Nation in general council, both Men &amp;
    <lb/>Women, adding, that many of our Men are now here
    <lb/>but our Women could not come, but our Men will
    <lb/>tell what you say to their families when they get
    <lb/>home, closing with reminding us of their poverty, &amp;
    <lb/>that their houses were poor &amp; covered with bark &amp;
    <lb/>that they were now ready to hear what we had to
    <lb/>say to them. We now, as at some other times felt
    <lb/>our
        <lb/><pb n ="16" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_016"/>
    <lb/>our minds humblingly impressed with the weight of
    <lb/>the business we are engaged in; and after a short but
    <lb/>serious pause on our parts, we proceeded to inform them
    <lb/>of the nature of our errand &amp; also made some other obser-
    <lb/>vations, exhorting them to stillness &amp; quietude and an
    <lb/>attention to the good Spirit in their own hearts, after
    <lb/>which we read our Certificate to them by paragraphs
    <lb/>which was interpreted with difficulty by <persName key="abeel">Henry Obeal</persName>: we also read
       <lb/><persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson’s</persName> letter to them in like manner
    <lb/>after which we were enabled to communicate some
    <lb/>serious advice, &amp; to expostulate with them upon various
    <lb/>subjects relative both to their moral &amp; civil conduct
    <lb/>during the whole of which, several of them manifested a
    <lb/>becoming attention &amp; solidity, tho’ some others appear’d
    <lb/>painfully light &amp; insensible. They requested according
    <lb/>to custom, some time to consider of what we said to them
    <lb/>&amp; proposed making us a speech in answer, when they
    <lb/>had talked it over in their own families.
   </p><p>We may close our observations on this council, by our
    <lb/>humble acknowledgement, that notwithstanding
    <lb/>we find some things tryingly gloomy &amp; discouraging
    <lb/>yet we have had, at this time, renewed cause to believe
    <lb/>that the concern in which we are engaged, is owned by
    <lb/>him whose regard is towards all the workmanship
    <lb/>of his hands.

 </div> <div type="entry">

    <p>Past of this day, some of our Company were
    <lb/>employ’d in baking of bread, &amp; other domestic prepara-
    <lb/>tions; as we are now wholy our own cooks &amp; c. living on
    <lb/>the provisions which we brought on our horses from
        <lb/><placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName> &amp; <placeName key="frank">Franklin</placeName>, &amp; which we have sometimes
    <lb/>looked upon with some serious thoughtfulness, as ap-
    <lb/>pearing a scanty allowance for the time set for the
    <lb/>arrival of our boat; and the more especially, as we
    <lb/>were early inform’d of the great scarcity of corn a-
    <lb/>mongst the Indians, occasion’d, as they say by an
    <lb/>overflow of the River last spring, &amp; an early frost
    <lb/>in the fall; but our anxiety on this account, is now
        <lb/>much removed, by <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter’s</persName> desiring us, when
    <lb/>we got out of bread, to let him know, &amp; he would let
    <lb/>us have more, &amp; giving us to understand that he had
    <lb/>several barrels of flour, which he brought from
        <lb/>Pittsburgh.
   </p><p>The Indians, being most of this day steadily
    <lb/>in private council concerning our business, sever-
    <lb/>al times sent their deputies to ask particular
    <lb/>questions relative thereto; one of which was. How
    <lb/>could they learn to plough, &amp; do what we proposed,
    <lb/>seeing
        <lb/><pb n ="18" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_018"/>
    <lb/>seeing they had got no horses &amp; Oxen, &amp; were so poor that
    <lb/>they had no money to buy them with.
   </p><p>We let them know, we did not expect great things
    <lb/>to be done all at once, but that we wanted them to make
    <lb/>a beginning: that we had seen two horses running about
    <lb/>their town &amp; that they were enough to draw one plough
    <lb/>and that we knew they had money coming in to them yearly
    <lb/>from the whole people, with which they might buy
    <lb/>more, &amp; perhaps some oxen, &amp; so come in by degrees, as
    <lb/>they were able, &amp; that our young Men had horses, with
    <lb/>which they would sometimes assist them. With this
    <lb/>answer they appeared to be satisfied, tho’ it was pretty
    <lb/>evident it was not what this question was artfully
    <lb/>calculated to draw from us.
   </p><p>About 6 in the evening the Indians again
    <lb/>met us in public council in order to give us an answer
    <lb/>to our proposals of yesterday, and after being a short time
       <lb/>seated, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; his son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName> stood up &amp; addressed
    <lb/>us to the following effect.
   </p>
    <floatingText type="speech">
       <body>
    <p>Brothers the Quakers,
    <lb/>Listen now to what I am going to
    <lb/>say to you.
   </p><p>you know, Brothers, the red people are poor
    <lb/>they
        <lb/><pb n ="19" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_019"/>
    <lb/>they are not like the white people, the great spirit,
    <lb/>has made them of another language; so that it is
    <lb/>very hard for us to understand one another plainly
    <lb/>as there is no person here that can interpret very well
   </p><p>Brothers. We take great pains to settle the propo-
    <lb/>sals you made to us but we differ in opinions and
    <lb/>we must take great pains to have every thing com-
    <lb/>plete.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We suppose the reason you came here was
    <lb/>to help poor Indians some way or other, and you
    <lb/>wish the chiefs to tell their Warriors not to go on
    <lb/>so bad as they have done, and you wish us to take
    <lb/>up work like the white people, Now Brothers
    <lb/>some of our sober Men will take up work &amp; do as
    <lb/>you say, &amp; if they do well then your young Men
    <lb/>will stay longer; but some others will not mind
    <lb/>what you say.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We cant say a Word against you, it is the best
    <lb/>way to call Quakers Brothers, <del>you never wished our
    <lb/>lands</del>, you never wished our lands, you never wished
    <lb/>any part of our lands, therefore we are determined to
    <lb/>try to learn your ways, &amp; these young Men may
    <lb/>stay
        <lb/><pb n ="20" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_020"/>
    <lb/>stay here two years to try, by that time we shall know
    <lb/>whether Morris will leave us any Land &amp; whether he
    <lb/>will pay us our money; for last Summer we sold
    <lb/>our Land &amp; we dont know yet whether we shall
    <lb/>get what we reserved, or whether we shall get our
    <lb/>Money; but by that time we shall know, &amp; then if
    <lb/>they like it, &amp; we like it your young Men may stay longer.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>If your young Men stay here we want them to
    <lb/>learn our children to read &amp; write.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>Two of you are going home again, if they
    <lb/>hear any thing about our Land, or our Money they
    <lb/>must write to these young Men here &amp; they must tell
    <lb/>us, if we are like to be cheated.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>This is all I got to say at present.
    </p> </body>
 </floatingText>
   <p>After they had closed this speech we informed them
    <lb/>that we understood what they had said to us, &amp; that we
    <lb/>were satisfied with it, and proposed that our young
    <lb/>Men must have some place to live in, &amp; a piece of land
    <lb/>to work, in order to set them an example, &amp; to raise bread
    <lb/>for themselves to eat; but that the land should still
    <lb/>be theirs &amp; all the improvements which we should put
    <lb/>on
        <lb/><pb n ="21" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_021"/>
    <lb/>on it, would also be theirs, when we left it, &amp; in order to
    <lb/>know where it would be best for our young Men to
    <lb/>settle and make a beginning, we must look a little
    <lb/>about their Country &amp; go to their upper town, and
    <lb/>we desired some of their chiefs might go along with
    <lb/>us, &amp; help to agree on some suitable places where
    <lb/>our friends could be of most use to their people in
    <lb/>general. To which they readily agreed. We next
    <lb/>inform’d that we had a number of Plough Irons, hoes, aces
    <lb/>Scythes &amp; other farming utensils, coming up in a boat,
    <lb/>besides carpenters, Mason, &amp; Cooperstools, which were
    <lb/>intended for their use &amp; would be left with them &amp;
    <lb/>never taken away again, but that we thought it
    <lb/>best, &amp; most for their Good, to leave them particu-
    <lb/>larly under our friends care &amp; not to give them away
    <lb/>at present, but only to lend them, that they might
    <lb/>have the use of them , for they knew that some of
    <lb/>their young Men were not so good as they should
    <lb/>be, and if these things were divided amongst them
    <lb/>some might pawn them away for whisky &amp; then
    <lb/>they would be as bad off as they were before they got
    <lb/>them. At this observation some of their old Men
    <lb/>and chiefs appeared to express their approbation
    <lb/>whilst some of their young Men manifested their
    <lb/>sen
        <lb/><pb n ="22" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_022"/>
    <lb/>sensibility of its pertinence by a shamefaced good
       <lb/>humoured laugh. After which <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> ex-
    <lb/>pressed a few words, indicating his satisfaction with
    <lb/>what had been said, &amp; that we would now shake
    <lb/>hands as brothers, &amp; directed his people to use &amp; come
    <lb/><del>towards us</del>to us, and shake hands by course, himself first
    <lb/>setting the example.
   </p><p>Thus this council ended after letting them know
    <lb/>that we should want one more general council with
    <lb/>them before we left them. </p>
 </div> <div type="entry">
    <dateline><date when="1798-05-20">1st day 20th</date></dateline>
    <p>This being first day, we believed it would
    <lb/>be right to sit down together, according to our usual
    <lb/>manner, for religious retirement, and it was conclu-
        <lb/>ded best to inform <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> of our intentions &amp; to
    <lb/>let him know, that his company &amp; that of any other
    <lb/>of his people who should choose to come &amp; sit with
    <lb/>us, in our way would be acceptable.
   </p><p>Before we had given this information Cornplanter
    <lb/>&amp; his Son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName> came into our apartment and made
    <lb/>in substance the following apology.
   </p><p>Brothers, You must not think hard that we do not
    <lb/>keep the first day as the white people do, for we are
    <lb/>ignorant, &amp; cant read &amp; write as they can, besides we are
    <lb/>poor,
        <lb/><pb n ="23" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_023"/>
    <lb/>poor &amp; have to work &amp; our Men are often out a
    <lb/>hunting, and have to attend to their game.
   </p><p>We let him know we did not think hard
    <lb/>of them about this matter, and then informed him
    <lb/>of our conclusion as above.
   </p><p>About 10 OClock we sat down, &amp; <persName key="cornp2">Cornplante</persName>r
    <lb/>&amp; several others came in, &amp; sat quiet &amp; sober for
    <lb/>some time, &amp; quietly withdrew excepting Corn-
    <lb/>planter, who staid the sitting out, with apparent
    <lb/>solidity; our door was open &amp; divers came and
    <lb/>looked at us, and manifested no lightness on the
    <lb/>occasion.
   </p>
 </div> <div type="entry">
    <dateline><date when="1798-05-21">2nd day 21st</date></dateline>
    <p>Agreeably to our proposals of seventh
    <lb/>day we made early preparations to go up the River
    <lb/>to <placeName key="genes1">Genisenguhta</placeName> an Indian village about 9
    <lb/>Miles up, in the State of <placeName key="newyo">New York</placeName>, in order to
    <lb/>view the Indian Lands &amp; endeavour to determine
    <lb/>the most eligible place for our friends to settle &amp;
    <lb/>make a beginning amongst them; About 9 OClock
        <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> his Son <persName key="abeel">Henry</persName> &amp; three others were in
    <lb/>readiness to accompany us, we all /being 10 in num-
    <lb/>ber/ went aboard a single Canoe &amp; in a few hours
    <lb/>arrived at our destined pos; We spent several
    <lb/>hours
        <lb/><pb n ="24" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_024"/>
    <lb/>hours in viewing the land in this village &amp; its vicinity
    <lb/>&amp; believed it not quite equal in quality with that of
        <lb/><placeName key="jenuch">Jenuchshedaga</placeName>, the place we last came from: this
    <lb/>circumstance together with that of the Indians hav-
    <lb/>ing mostly left it, and settled with their chief, at the
    <lb/>place aforesaid made it somewhat trying to deter-
    <lb/>mine where to make our settlement, but after mature
    <lb/>consideration &amp; taking into view every occuring cir-
    <lb/>cumstance relative to the concern, we were at length
    <lb/>favoured to write in fixing upon a spot near the
    <lb/>old village which is in <placeName key="newyo">New York state</placeName> about 4
    <lb/>Miles above the <placeName key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> line.
   </p><p>After we had come to this conclusion amongst
       <lb/>ourselves, we informed <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; those who
    <lb/>were with him of our result, adding that if they
    <lb/>liked it, we hoped they would tell us so; &amp; if they
    <lb/>did not like the place we proposed we wished them
    <lb/>to be plain with us &amp; tell us so; and propose some
    <lb/>other that they should like better. To which Corn
    <lb/>planter returned answer in substance as follows.
   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>I told you, all our Land is before you, you
    <lb/>may choose any place you like best, &amp; this Man
    <lb/>who lives here, in this town, is very sober Man, most
    <lb/>like
        <lb/><pb n ="25" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_025"/>
    <lb/>like yourselves he drinks no whisky, he is very glad
    <lb/>you are going to settle so near him.
   </p><p>We next proposed that our young Men should
    <lb/>have liberty to cut wood, out of their Woods for rails
    <lb/>firewood &amp; c. To which he replied, O Yes I wish you
    <lb/>would cut all the Trees down, and another thing
    <lb/>Brothers, you may have; If you see a deer Swim-
    <lb/>ing cross the River, or in the Woods you may shoot
    <lb/>him; or if you see any fish in the river you may
    <lb/>catch him.
   </p><p>The Indians, generally, in this place, being
    <lb/>much unacquainted with writing, &amp; appearing
    <lb/>so heartily to confide in us as to give up, without
    <lb/>any reserve all their Land to our choice, we
    <lb/>believed it best not be very particular in de-
    <lb/>termining our boundaries, nor to propose any
    <lb/>formal Articles of Agreement between them
    <lb/>&amp; our young Men, lest it should have a tenden-
    <lb/>cy to create <del>a</del> suspicions &amp; lesson that unlimited
    <lb/>confidence they at present appear to repose in
    <lb/>us.
   </p><p>Agreeably to the treaty of last Summer, this
    <lb/>reservation is to contain 42 square Miles, to be
    <lb/>laid of in such shape as the Indians shall direct
    <lb/>&amp;
        <lb/><pb n ="26" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_026"/>
    <lb/>and we understand by them that they mean to take it in
    <lb/>a narrow strip of half a Mile on each side of the river
    <lb/>which according to our observation, as far as we have
    <lb/>been on the river will take in most of the arable
    <lb/>Land near adjoining thereto, &amp; a large proportion of
    <lb/>this is flats, subject at certain periods to be overflow’d
    <lb/>by fresher, which renders the local situation of these
    <lb/>people rather unfavourable to our plan as the over-
    <lb/>flowing of a great part of their most <del>arable</del> fertile possession
    <lb/>is a discouragement to agriculture, whilst a considerable
    <lb/>extent of mountainous &amp; unarable adjoining Lands,
    <lb/>will probably be an inducement to a continuation of
    <lb/>their usual mode of subsistance.
   </p><p>About 3 Miles below this town is a saw Mill,
       <lb/>the private property of <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, tho’ built on the
    <lb/>Indian Lands; it is on a poor stream, &amp; badly situa-
    <lb/>ted; subject to be stoped by back water when the River
    <lb/>is high, &amp; when the Waters are low, it is almost dry. It
    <lb/>is now tended by a white Man, who is a Mill wright &amp;
    <lb/>appears to be an ingenuous Man, particularly in Wood,
    <lb/>but we fear of a turn of mind not favourable to the Indians
    <lb/>real good, or to our concern, as we understand he keep
    <lb/>a supply of whisky, which he barters away to them for
    <lb/>corn
        <lb/><pb n ="27" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_027"/>
    <lb/>corn, potatoes, &amp; other things as best suits his own con-
    <lb/>veniency, &amp; we doubt without much, if any regard
    <lb/>to their true interest.
   </p><p>About 5 OClock left the old village &amp; return’d
       <lb/>with <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> to our lodgings at his house, at
       <lb/><placeName key="jenuch">Jenuchshedagea</placeName>.

    <p>This morning took up the consideration
    <lb/>of what further propositions might, with propriety
    <lb/>be made to these people, in order for their addition-
    <lb/>al encouragement in civilization &amp; agriculture, &amp;
    <lb/>being favoured to unite in what was expedient, they
    <lb/>were committed to writing, in readiness for our next
    <lb/>council in the minutes of which they will appear.
    <lb/>We were this day, as well as at some other time, pret-
    <lb/>ty closely interrogated about <persName key="rmorr1">Robt Morris</persName> of <placeName key="phila">Philada</placeName>
        <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; other Indians here, having heard that
    <lb/>he was in Jail, appear to be somewhat alarmed, lest
    <lb/>they should loose their Money as well as Land, which
    <lb/>we understand they parted with, with <del>great</del> some reluctance
    <lb/>They had likewise heard that the Land was not
    <lb/>purchased for Morris, as they expected, but for some
    <lb/>others whom they call the Holland People. With
    <lb/>these
        <lb/><pb n ="28" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_028"/>
    <lb/>these things they appear much disturbed as apprehend-
    <lb/>ing they are altogether deceived &amp; cheated &amp; even go so
    <lb/>far as to declare if they can not have justice done then
    <lb/>they will not receive their Money, but loose their land
    <lb/>altogether.
   </p><p>We felt cautious if giving a sentiment on this
    <lb/>business, not being fully acquainted with it, &amp; would
    <lb/>have put it off, by referring them to <persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName>,
    <lb/>as much better acquainted with it than we were, &amp; to whom
       <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; his Son expected shortly to go, on this or some
    <lb/>other concerns; but with this reference Cornplanter did
    <lb/>not appear fully satisfied, observing that Capt Chapin
    <lb/>had told him, that <persName key="rmorr1">Morris</persName> was a very good &amp; honest
    <lb/>Man, and yet he was got into Jail, now he could not
    <lb/>understand how a good and honest Man should get into
    <lb/>Jail, however, he said he intended to ask Capt Chapin
    <lb/>where his good &amp; honest Man Morris was now.
   </p><p>We were at length easy to observe to them in general
    <lb/>terms, that it was not the advice of their Brothers, the
    <lb/>Quakers to sell their Land for we would rather they
    <lb/>would keep their land, &amp; learn to work it themselves
    <lb/>but as it was not Sold, &amp; we thought they could not get
    <lb/>it,
        <lb/><pb n ="29" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_029"/>
    <lb/>it back again, we were of the mind they had better
    <lb/>take their Money which we apprehended was, or
    <lb/>would be made secure for them, &amp; endeavour to be
    <lb/>as contented as they could about it.
   </p><p>This evening <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> presented us with
    <lb/>a quantity of Seed Corn of different kinds suitable
    <lb/>to the climate, Some seed Potatoes, a large proporti-
    <lb/>on of Beans of divers kinds a variety of useful Seeds
    <lb/>such as pumpkins, Cucumbers, water Mellons &amp;
    <lb/>these he inform’d were a collection brought in by his
    <lb/>people, &amp; given to us as a blessing to begin with
    <lb/>we acknowledged their kindness, &amp; would have ta-
    <lb/>ken only a part of them, there being much more of
    <lb/>each kind, excepting potatoes, than we should
    <lb/>stand in need of for beed; but they insisted that we
    <lb/>should take the whole, which we accordingly did,
    <lb/>and felt an encouraging belief that this small
    <lb/>present originated from a hearty goodwill to us,
    <lb/>and our undertaking.

    <p>The forepart of this day some of our com-
    <lb/>pany were engaged in writing, &amp; arranging our
    <lb/>business whilst others were employ’d in preparing
       <lb/>for our removal up to <placeName key="genes1">Genisenguhta</placeName> the place
    <lb/>pro
        <lb/><pb n ="30" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_030"/>
    <lb/>proposed for our settlement, &amp; where we this day pro-
    <lb/>pose going, in order to agree with some of the Indians
    <lb/>for a Cabbin to accommodate our friends till they
    <lb/>should have leisure to build for themselves.
   </p><p>Accordingly about noon we set out Some on horseback
    <lb/>&amp; some in a Canoe, with our baggage &amp; accompanied
    <lb/>by <persName key="abeel">Henry Obeal</persName> our Interpreter, about 3 in the
    <lb/>afternoon we met again at the place proposed &amp;
    <lb/>shortly after had a conference with the Woman who
    <lb/>owned the Cabbin, we had pitched upon as most
    <lb/>suitable for our purpose, we found her willing to
    <lb/>part with her house but she manifested some reluc
    <lb/>tance in parting with the fruits of her labour, in
    <lb/>four or five small patches of Corn, vines &amp; c. not
    <lb/>more than one of which contained much more than
    <lb/>a square perch of ground, &amp; the while we thought
    <lb/>would not have produced more than 3 or 4 Bushels of
    <lb/>Corn, but after some time she gave them all up, but
    <lb/>one which lay some distance off &amp; appeared not much
    <lb/>in our way we at length agreed for the House &amp; appur-
    <lb/>tenances, excepting the one Lot of corn aforesaid, which
    <lb/>was reserved to her for the present year &amp; paid her 20 Dolrs
    <lb/>as the whole purchase Money &amp; she relinquished all
    <lb/>claim
        <lb/><pb n ="31" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_031"/>
    <lb/>claim thereto, &amp; with the help of our young Men &amp;
    <lb/>some Indian children, moved <del>the</del> her things immedi-
    <lb/>ately out &amp; we took possession, cleaned out the house
    <lb/>got our provisions &amp; other baggage in &amp; took up
    <lb/>our lodging here for this night.
   </p><p>It may be proper to note, that before we agreed
    <lb/>to pay the whole purchase money aforesaid at
    <lb/>one payment we enquired particularly into the
    <lb/>character of the Woman, &amp; was inform’d that she was
    <lb/>a sober woman drank no whisky, &amp; would be like
    <lb/>ly to make good use of her money.

    <p>This Morning our young Men got to
    <lb/>Work, having previously borrowed some tools of Corn-
    <lb/>planter; they got a piece of Ground cleared of rubbage
    <lb/>&amp; dug up for a garden, &amp; our small quantity of po-
    <lb/>tatoes planted, &amp; the ground prepared for the recep-
    <lb/>tion of some other seeds, when they were stopped in
    <lb/>their business by rain, which continued at inter-
    <lb/>vals for most of this day.
   </p><p>About 11 OClock we felt our minds engaged
    <lb/>to draw into our new habitation &amp; sit down toge-
    <lb/>ther for religious retirement, in which we were
    <lb/>fa-
        <lb/><pb n ="32" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_032"/>
    <lb/>favoured with the renewed extendings of divine regard
    <lb/>to the contriting of our Spirits &amp; strengthening of our
    <lb/>Minds in the work in which we are embarked &amp; we trust
    <lb/>it was a time to be encouragingly remember’d by our
    <lb/>friends when we are seperated from them.
   </p><p>We now sensibly feel the want of our Goods, which we
    <lb/>cannot look for in less than a Week from this time, the
    <lb/>season for planting corn being fully come, we are in
    <lb/>some doubts of getting much of that valuable article
    <lb/>in, so as to answer a good purpose the present season
    <lb/>but it is thought  best to use considerable exertions for
    <lb/>the attainment of so desirable an end; &amp; our young Men
    <lb/>propose having a piece of Ground cleared &amp; in readiness
    <lb/>for the plough against the arrival of our boat, that no
    <lb/>time may be lost, with respect to getting in as much
    <lb/>of this grain as our circumstances will admit.

    <p>This being a rainy day very little was
    <lb/>done at our clearing, one of our young Men was em-
    <lb/>ploy’d in baking of bread, &amp; some other of our company
    <lb/>in writing &amp; c.
   </p><p>We have had very little rain since we left home
    <lb/>till yesterday, &amp; the river was got so low, that some
    <lb/>of
        <lb/><pb n ="33" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_033"/>
    <lb/>of the Indians, who know this Navigation well,
    <lb/>began to doubt whether our Boat could come up;
    <lb/>but the present rain appears likely to afford a
    <lb/>reasonable &amp; plentiful supply.

    <p>This morning the river appears to
    <lb/>have risen about 18 Inches, tho’ hardly perceiva-
    <lb/>bly muddy; The day being fair considerable pro-
    <lb/>gress was made in our clearing, in cutting and
    <lb/>heaping old Logs grubbing &amp; c. in which we had
    <lb/>sometimes the help of a neighbouring Indian,
    <lb/>whose strength &amp; activity evince there was nothing
    <lb/>wanting but the will to make him a full work-
    <lb/>man at business of this kind.

    <p>This being first day, about 11 OClock
    <lb/>we sat down together for religious retirement, which
    <lb/>thro’ favour was a strengthening time to some of us.
    <lb/>Soon after the close of our sitting &amp; whilst we were
    <lb/>preparing what little provisions we had left for
    <lb/>our dinners, an Indian came into our Cabbin
    <lb/>with a quantity of fresh venison in his hand, &amp;
    <lb/>presented it to one of our company we supposed
    <lb/>these was about 4 lbs for which we offered him pay
    <lb/>which
        <lb/><pb n ="34" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_034"/>
    <lb/>which he shewed some reluctance at taking but as he could
    <lb/>speak no English we were at a loss to know whether his
    <lb/>apparent reluctance proceeded from an apprehension
    <lb/>we did not offer him enough, or from an intention of
    <lb/>giving us the meat; we however prevailed upon him
    <lb/>to <del>take</del> receive the money. We afterwards made him under-
        <lb/>stand we wanted to go down in a Canoe to <placeName key="jenuch">Jenuchsheda</placeName>
    <lb/>ga, where we had appointed to have a council tomorrow
    <lb/>he made signs, that he would go with us when the sun
    <lb/>got to such a place, pointing with his hand; he then
    <lb/>left us &amp; we went to dressing our meat, which was a
    <lb/>very acceptable supply, as we had not so much of our
    <lb/>own left as would make a meal for one person, &amp;
    <lb/>had heard of none to be purchased in this Country,
    <lb/>tho’ we had made considerable inquiry.
   </p><p>
    <lb/>About 4 in the afternoon, three of our company
    <lb/>together with the aforesaid Indian set off in a ca-
    <lb/>noe for Jenuchshedaga leaving two of our young
    <lb/>Men to come on horseback in the morning, some
    <lb/>time after we arrived, the Indian who accompani
       <lb/>ed us, handed <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> the money we had given
    <lb/>him for the meat, saying something to him in their
    <lb/>own language, and in a few minutes <persName key="abeel">Henry Obeal</persName>
    <lb/>inform’d that he said, he intended to give us the meat
    <lb/>that
        <lb/><pb n ="35" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_035"/>
    <lb/>that he was not willing to take any <del>part of </del> pay for it, but
    <lb/>could not make us understand him, therefore he
    <lb/>had brought the money along, in order to give it back
    <lb/>to us, we received the Money, expressed our sensibi-
    <lb/>lity of his kindness &amp; presented him with the same
    <lb/>Money for his trouble of bringing us down in the
    <lb/>Canoe, upon which terms he readily receiv’d it.

 </div> <div type="entry">
    <dateline><date when="1798-05-28">2nd day 28th</date></dateline>
    <p>About 12 OClock the Indians were gen-
    <lb/>erally collected in council, there being five or six
    <lb/>of their most respectable old Women present. Soon
        <lb/>after we were seated <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> made a pretty
    <lb/>lengthy speech which seemed not to be addressed
    <lb/>to us, but to some of the Indians present, &amp; when
    <lb/>he had closed the Interpreter inform’d he had been
    <lb/>expostulating with one of his people about some
    <lb/>misconduct and after a short pause he inform’d
    <lb/>us, that they were now collected together &amp; ready
    <lb/>to hear what we had to say to them.
   </p><p>After this information we were a few minutes
    <lb/>silent under a serious exercise of spirit for best
    <lb/>direction in our communications &amp; c. to these people
    <lb/>which is a state apparently very irksome to most
    <lb/>of them, as they too generally appear much unac-
    <lb/>quaint
        <lb/><pb n ="36" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_036"/>
    <lb/>quainted with any thing like inward stillness: We
    <lb/>were in a short time favoured with a degree of weight
    <lb/>and strength to make some introductory communica-
    <lb/>tions pertinent to the nature of our business; &amp; these
    <lb/>read the following propositions viz’ts.
   </p>
  <floatingText type="letter">
      <body><opener>To <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, and all our Indian brothers, of
       <lb/>the <orgName key="seneca">Seneca Nation</orgName> now living on the <placeName key="alleg">Allegeny River</placeName></opener>
   <p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We have not been several days amongst you,
    <lb/>&amp; have had councils with your Chiefs &amp; wise Men,
    <lb/>&amp; we have looked about your Country &amp; agreed upon
    <lb/>a place for our young Men to begin on &amp; we are glad
    <lb/>&amp; thankful to the great Spirit, that every thing
    <lb/>we have proposed for your good, has been so agree-
    <lb/>able to your minds that we seem to agree together
    <lb/>like Brothers, having but one mind in every thing
    <lb/>we do, &amp; we hope Brothers we shall continue to be
    <lb/>of one mind about all the things which we have
    <lb/>been speaking to you of.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>You know the place we have chosen
      <lb/>for our young Men to begin on, up at <placeName key="genes1">Genisenguh-
    <lb/>ta</placeName> and we hope some of your sober young men will
    <lb/>settle by ours, and fence of Lots, as they see our young
    <lb/>Men
        <lb/><pb n ="37" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_037"/>
    <lb/>Men fence off theirs; and our young Men will be
    <lb/>willing to instruct &amp; assist them a little about
    <lb/>working their Lots. Now Brothers, we think
    <lb/>our young friends will not be able to raise any
    <lb/>more, this year on their lot, than what they
    <lb/>will want to live upon; but we are in hopes
    <lb/>another year they will have a little to spare, &amp;
    <lb/>we are willing they should give to your old people
    <lb/>that cant work for themselves, one bushel out
    <lb/>of four of all the grain &amp; c. that they have to
    <lb/>spare; the rest they must have to buy salt and
    <lb/>other things with which they cant raise off
    <lb/>of the Ground.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>In order to encourage you still more to
    <lb/>take up work, &amp; to follow those ways, which we pointed
    <lb/>out to you we will agree to help you a little more.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We will send you a Smith’s tools, when our
    <lb/>young Men shall write us word, you stand in need
    <lb/>of them.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>If you are industrious this summer
    <lb/>&amp; raise a good deal of Corn, &amp; some wheat, we will
    <lb/>help
        <lb/><pb n ="38" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_038"/>
    <lb/>help you to build a Grist Mill next Summer, if a
    <lb/>suitable place can be found for it, you must find
    <lb/>half the Money to build this Mill, &amp; we will find the
    <lb/>other half. &amp; we hope brothers, you will save some of
    <lb/>the Money you get from the white people between
    <lb/>now &amp; that time, so that you may have your share
    <lb/>ready against next Spring, and we think you
    <lb/>had better choose one of your Chiefs to keep this
    <lb/>Money for you, till the time it is wanted or per-
    <lb/>haps your money may be all gone for Whisky or
    <lb/>something that wont do you so much good as a Mill
    <lb/>would.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We are also willing to encourage you to
    <lb/>take up work &amp; learn farming, by agreeing to give
    <lb/>some small premiums to such of our Indian brothers
    <lb/>who are industrious &amp; raise a good deal of Grain.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We will give to every Indian Man, living
    <lb/>on this river, who shall raise 25 Bushel of Wheat
    <lb/>or Rye in one year, on his own land, not worked by
    <lb/>white people, the sum of two Dollars.
    <lb/>2 For every 50 Bushel of Indian Corn raised by
    <lb/>any
        <lb/><pb n ="39" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_039"/>
    <lb/>any one Indian Man, in like manner aforesaid
    <lb/>the sum of two Dollars.
    <lb/>3 For every 50 Bushel of Potatoes raised by any
    <lb/>one Indian Man, in like manner aforesaid,
    <lb/>the Sum of two Dollars.
    <lb/>4 For every 2 Tons of Hay raised as aforesaid,
    <lb/>and put into a Stack or Ban, not being mown
    <lb/>or drawn in by white people, the sum of two Dolrs.
    <lb/>5 For every 12 yards of linen Cloth, made by any
    <lb/>Indian woman, out of flax raised on her own, or her
    <lb/>husbands land, &amp; spun in her own house, the Sum
    <lb/>of two Dollars to be paid to the Woman.
    <lb/>6 For every 12 yards of woolen Cloth, or linsey made
    <lb/>by any Indian woman, out of the wool of her
    <lb/>own, or her husband’s Sheep, &amp; Spun in her own
    <lb/>house the Sum of two Dollars, to be paid to the
    <lb/>Woman.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We will give you these premiums for
    <lb/>four years from this time, if our young Men
    <lb/>stay
        <lb/><pb n ="40" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_040"/>
    <lb/>stay so long, upon these conditions that the person who
    <lb/>applies for the premium must produce a certificate from
    <lb/>two of the Chiefs, certifying the quantity of grain, cloth
    <lb/>&amp; c. for which the premium is demanded, &amp; that it was
    <lb/>raised, or made in the manner above mentioned, and
    <lb/>that the person so applying has not been intoxicated
    <lb/>with strong drink at least for the term of six Months
    <lb/>before such application.

       <lb/>&amp; <persName key="hjack1">Halliday Jackson</persName> are hereby authorized &amp; desired

    <p>After reading these propositions, we were again
    <lb/>enabled seriously to expostulate with them on various
    <lb/>subjects relative both to their moral &amp; temporal con-
    <lb/>duct; but particularly on their excessive use of strong
    <lb/>drink, a variety of instances whereof we had been eye
    <lb/>witnesses to. Divers of them, as heretofore, appear’d

    <lb/>solid, &amp; particularly the women, but much the greater
    <lb/>number manifested no sense of conviction, or read
    <lb/>seriousness. They then proposed retiring into a

    <lb/>they accordingly did, &amp; in about an hour return’d &amp;
        <lb/>being seated <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> made a speech, in sub-

      <body> <p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We now hear all what you would wish
    <lb/>to do among us; you are come here to see us bro-
    <lb/>thers You wish us well: you wish us to become as
    <lb/>the white people: The white people are rich &amp; got
    <lb/>every thing; the Indians are poor &amp; have nothing.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>One thing you told us, It would be good
    <lb/>for us to build a Mill, we must find 400 Dollars, &amp;
    <lb/>you will find 400 Dollars.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We cant say but few words, at this time,
    <lb/>about the Mill, we will consult <persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName>, if
    <lb/>he thinks we will receive our Money &amp; will be able

   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>We know how far you have come to see us;
    <lb/>it is a great way, from the Sea shore, where our fore-
    <lb/>fathers once lived, The white people have cheated us
    <lb/>&amp; got our Land from us, &amp; now we have but little
    <lb/>left, &amp; we will try to learn your way.
   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>You know there are some bad people
    <lb/>among us, &amp; you know we have been cheated and
    <lb/>that makes us bad, &amp; our minds uneasy, if we had not
    <lb/>been cheated, we should have been very rich people
    <lb/>&amp; had plenty of every thing, &amp; then our minds would
    <lb/>be easy, and we could think upon the good Spirit.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>The reason I mention to you about our
    <lb/>being cheated, some of my warriors wont mind what
    <lb/>I say to them, but will have their own way, because
    <lb/>they know I have been often cheated by the white

   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We cant all go to work at once, some of
    <lb/>my warriors will go a hunting to get provisions, &amp;
    <lb/>sometimes they break a gun, &amp; then it takes a great
    <lb/>deal of Money to buy another; and we have very few
    <lb/>hoes, &amp; axes, &amp; such things amongst us, and we are
    <lb/>not able to get them.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>I will go along with you to <placeName key="conan">Canadarque</placeName>
    <lb/>and then we will get matters settled about the Mill,
    <lb/>&amp; bring it back to your young Men in writing.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>This is all I got to say.

   <p>At the close of this speech we expressed a few
    <lb/>words more, representing, among other things, the
    <lb/>unreasonableness of their present practice in suffer-
    <lb/>ing their women to work all day in the fields &amp; woods
    <lb/>with the hoes &amp; axes, whilst the Men &amp; Boys were at
    <lb/>the same time playing with their bows &amp; arrows,
    <lb/>&amp; recommending to them to begin our way, by taking
    <lb/>out their boys to hoe &amp; c. we concluded with se-
    <lb/>riously pressing on their minds the remembrance
    <lb/>That
        <lb/><pb n ="44" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_044"/>
    <lb/>That it was from the good Spirit they received every
    <lb/>good thing, &amp; that he could hear every word they
    <lb/>said, and see every thing they did, and that they were
    <lb/>equally with the white people, objects of his tender
    <lb/>care &amp; regard; and that the great disparity, which
    <lb/>they so frequently spoke of between them &amp; the white
    <lb/>people, with regard to plenty &amp; poverty was the na-
    <lb/>tural result of the different plans pursued in the
    <lb/>obtaining the blessings of this life, &amp; that, as their
    <lb/>ground was equally good, with that possessed by
    <lb/>the white people, it would also be equally pro-
    <lb/>ductive, if the same Industry &amp; methods of farming
    <lb/>were pursued.
   </p><p>In a few minutes after we had concluded, and
       <lb/>informed them so; <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> observed; Now all
    <lb/>things are settled &amp; done, we will cover up the Coun-
    <lb/>cil fire.
   </p><p>In the evening our young Men returned to
      <lb/>their own house at <placeName key="genes1">Genisenguhta</placeName>, whilst the other
    <lb/>two remained at <placeName key="cornp">Cornplanters</placeName> in Order to wait for
    <lb/>our Goods, and to settle some matters with him re-
    <lb/>lative to our leaving these parts; which we wished
    <lb/>now to effect, as soon as we should see our goods safely
    <lb/>ar-
        <lb/><pb n ="45" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_045"/>
    <lb/>arrived.
   </p><p>Sometime after night a messenger arrived here
    <lb/>from Farmers, Brother, at <placeName key="buffa">Buffolo</placeName>, requesting <persName key="cornp2">Corn-
    <lb/>planters</persName> attendance at that place; the Surveyors &amp; c.
    <lb/>being come in orer to run the lines of their reserva
    <lb/>tions agreeably to a treaty of last Summer with
       <lb/><persName key="rmorr1">Robt Morris</persName>; <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> expressed a particular de-
    <lb/>sire that we should attend their Council on the
    <lb/>occasion at the aforesaid place. we had for sometime
    <lb/>past, felt our minds rather turned towards taking <placeName key="conan">Ca-
    <lb/>nandarque</placeName> &amp; <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> in our way home &amp; upon
    <lb/>enquiry were informed that we could not get to Ca-
    <lb/>nandarque from this place with out going by Buffalo; we were there-
    <lb/>fore easy to agree to attend at the aforesaid place.
    <lb/>It remained now to fix on a time for our setting out,
    <lb/>but to this end the want of our goods seemed in the
    <lb/>way as we had heard nothing from them since we
       <lb/>left <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName> a full result was therefore defered.

    <p>Most of this &amp; past of the succeeding

        <lb/>another to <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson</persName>, containing a brief
    <lb/>nar-
        <lb/><pb n ="46" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_046"/>
    <lb/>narrative of our proceedings since our arrival here.
    </p><p>In a private conference with <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> and
    <lb/>two or three others we obtained the following informa-
    <lb/>tion That the Indians in this reservation consist of
    <lb/>between 3 &amp; 4 hundred individuals, have 3 horses,
    <lb/>14 homed cattle 1 yoke of Oxen &amp; 12 hogs, all private
    <lb/>property.
   </p><p>They have two solemnities in a year in form
    <lb/>of public worship or thanksgiving to the Great Spirit,
    <lb/>one in the Spring, &amp; the other about the time of
    <lb/>their corn ripening.
   </p><p>This afternoon was exhibited a curious scene by the
    <lb/>Indians in this village. Hearing an unusual noise
    <lb/>near our apartment where we were employed in wri-
    <lb/>ting, our attention was drawn without, there we ob-
    <lb/>served two Indian,s with naked legs &amp; thighs bear skins
    <lb/>over their shoulders &amp; false faces, with the most grim
    <lb/>&amp; tenible aspects, gaping &amp; distorted Mouths, huge noses
    <lb/>&amp; glaring &amp; frightful eyes, with great bunches of hair
    <lb/>falling on each side some standing up &amp; some flying
    <lb/>about the face, &amp; carrying in one hand the shell of
    <lb/>a Water Tortoise fatsened to a stick about 8 Inches long
    <lb/>and
        <lb/><pb n ="47" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_047"/>
    <lb/>and enclosing a number of stones, or some other sub-
    <lb/>stances, with which they made a great rattling &amp;
    <lb/>often running to the sides of a certain House rubed
    <lb/>them hardly up &amp; down over the rough logs, thereby
    <lb/>greatly increasing the noise, &amp; often accompanying
    <lb/>it with a hide our muttering sound out of their own
    <lb/>mouths, &amp; almost all their gestures were complete-
    <lb/>ly frantic.
   </p><p>There were a considerable number of young
    <lb/>Indians collected to this scene, who were attempting
    <lb/>to look through the chinks of the house, where these
    <lb/>Monsters appear’d station’d as guards, but were re-
    <lb/>markably afraid of being caught by them, and
    <lb/>indeed these creatures seemed to perform their part
    <lb/>well in keeping them away. We saw several el-
    <lb/>derly women go eleven times in and out of the house
    <lb/>during these transactions, wearing a serious counte-
    <lb/>nance, and sometimes speaking to the false faces
    <lb/>as these prodigies were called.
   </p><p>We asked our Interpreter the meaning of these
    <lb/>transactions, but he evaded our interrogations, telling
    <lb/>us it was only play, &amp; again that there was a
    <lb/>company of Women there drinking whisky and
    <lb/>that
        <lb/><pb n ="48" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_048"/>
    <lb/>that these Men were set there to keep the young fel-
    <lb/>lows away, but neither of these answers accorded with
    <lb/>the appearances &amp; countenances, which we saw frequent-
    <lb/>ly go in &amp; out. In short we were strongly persuad
    <lb/>ed this astonishing scene was transacted as a ceremo-
    <lb/>ny, or rejoicing at the birth of a child, or otherwise to
    <lb/>keep the young Men at a distance, &amp; thereby secure
    <lb/>that privacy the nature of the case called for &amp; which
    <lb/>their houses were not calculated to afford.

    <lb/>place where the Boatman had agreed to deliver

    </p><p>In the afternoon <persName key="jshar1">J. Sharpless</persName> &amp; myself went

    <lb/>able distance up the Creek found it had plenty
    <lb/>of fall, &amp; appeared to have a sufficiency of water
    <lb/>with a good bank &amp; place for a Mill, much out
    <lb/>of the way of floods which are sometimes great in
    <lb/>in this River, and at the Same time so that Canoes
    <lb/>might come up a short tail race to the Mill;
    <lb/>but against these advantages, the water must
    <lb/>be brought through, or over a quarry of slate
    <lb/>stone for near 20 perches, or otherwise by taking
    <lb/>the water out below said quarry, we supposed more
    <lb/>than 8 or 10 feet fall could not be obtained.
   </p><p>Mill seats are very scarce in this reservation,

    <lb/>as a reason for their disappointing us yesterday

    <lb/>of his family had fallen off a horse &amp; broke her arm
    <lb/>&amp; that he could not go with us for two or three days

    <lb/>and take up our lodging here this night, our guide ta-
    <lb/>king us a few perches back from the river, to a sand
    <lb/>bank, which he appeared to fix upon as most eligible
    <lb/>for our quarters; here he soon struck up a fire and we
    <lb/>uncased our horses, turned them out, got our suppers &amp;
    <lb/>disposed ourselves for rest, having previously fixed
    <lb/>up a few bushes to break off some of the dew; thus ac-
    <lb/>commodated, we soon forgot our difficulties in refresh-
    <lb/>ing sleep; but our horses suffer’d much with flies and
    <lb/>moschettoes.

    <p>Early this morning took a walk to the
    <lb/>river bank &amp; thought we could discover some marks
    <lb/>of its falling three or four Inches since last evening
    <lb/>we therefore concluded to attempt crossing as early as we
    <lb/>could get in readiness: about 5 OClock we mounted
    <lb/>our horses, &amp; our guide bading us a circle through the
    <lb/>woods &amp; bushes, came to the River at the head of two
    <lb/>Sand bars, about 60 perches above the common fording
    <lb/>at the bank <del>we</del> he made a halt, pointing the course
    <lb/>we must go, and making signs for us to go foremost,
    <lb/>which we did, crossing without difficulty two small
    <lb/>channels, w’ch seperated the Islands from the shore,
    <lb/>&amp; from each other; &amp; riding to the lower end of the
    <lb/>largest one; we observed the main body of the water
    <lb/>lay on the other side, which Ran with great rapidi
    <lb/>ty
        <lb/><pb n ="58" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_058"/>
    <lb/>ty, &amp; being muddy, we could form no idea of its depth,
    <lb/>but our guide marked our horses nearly up to the top
    <lb/>of their backs to represent it, &amp; shewed evident marks
    <lb/>of fear to cross, absolutely refusing to go in foremost;
       <lb/>in this situation <persName key="jshar1">J. Sharpless</persName> having provided himself
    <lb/>with a long pole, entered the water, still measuring
    <lb/>its depth before his horse &amp; crossed safe finding it not
    <lb/>so deep as our guide had supposed; which had it been, no
    <lb/>horse could have kept his feet, the rapidity was so great ;
    <lb/>we soon followed, &amp; also landed safe, then proceeded
    <lb/>down the River through a very fat country about
    <lb/>9 Miles to a small village of Muncy Indians, where
    <lb/>we stoped and breakfasted: most of the principal Men
    <lb/>being about home, they soon collected into the house, into
    <lb/>which we had been conducted, &amp; there being a white
    <lb/>Men present who could interpret, we were most easy to
    <lb/>let them know what we had been doing at <placeName key="alleg1">Allegany</placeName>,
    <lb/>&amp; the nature of our concern in general amongst the In-
    <lb/>dians, pointing out to them the advantages which must
    <lb/>result from the wish’d for change in their manner of
    <lb/>living. They were in a good degree attentive in general
    <lb/>&amp; expressed their gladness to hear, from our own mouths,
    <lb/>what we had been doing among their brother at Al-
    <lb/>legany, we left this place about 10, proceeded on
    <lb/>through
        <lb/><pb n ="59" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_059"/>
    <lb/>through a rich, wet, &amp; boggy country, about 7 Miles to
    <lb/>Lake Erie, here we indulged ourselves a few moments
    <lb/>in gratifying our sight, which had been long confined to
    <lb/>narrow limits through the wilderness; but could now
    <lb/>traverse in almost every direction the majestic liquid
    <lb/>element as far as the natural sphericity of the globe
    <lb/>would admit. We now promised ourselves a plea-
    <lb/>sant ride &amp; good road down the beach of this <del>leak</del> lake to
    <lb/><placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> which was computed 29 Miles, but soon
    <lb/>found our mistake as to the road, it being very hea
    <lb/>vy &amp; wearisome to the horses, as it consisted mostly
    <lb/>where we were out of the water, of coarse sand or
    <lb/>gravel, which gave way under their feet, &amp; was oft
    <lb/>en nearly fetlock deep; besides which we were in se-
    <lb/>veral places confines, for 40 perches &amp; more at a time,
    <lb/>by a nearly perpendicular wall of slate &amp; other stone
    <lb/>intermixed with small stratas of early to the height
    <lb/>of 40 feet &amp; upwards, on our right, with the lake
    <lb/>on our left, with its billows rolling under our horses
    <lb/>&amp; dashing against these rocks would often rebound,
    <lb/>back, in heavy drops over our heads: add to this, that
    <lb/>in many places, for several perches together, the
    <lb/>water was nearly belly deep upon a level, exclusive
    <lb/>of the additional depth occasion’d by the surge and of
    <lb/>so
        <lb/><pb n ="60" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_060"/>
    <lb/>so thick  &amp; dark a nature that no glimpse of the bottom
    <lb/>could be discuss’d, that the moment when our horses
    <lb/>might be tumbling over rocks, or plunging into holes
    <lb/>was to us unknown. And at times strongly painted
    <lb/>in the imagination, but through all our difficul-
    <lb/>ties we were preserved, so as to arrive safe at <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> about
    <lb/>Sun set, with wearied horses, but quiet minds.
   </p><p>We crossed <placeName key="buffr">Buffalo River</placeName> in a boat &amp; swam
    <lb/>our horses over; here we met with a company of
    <lb/>Surveyors &amp; their Assistants, encamped on the bank,
    <lb/>amongst whom was J. Tompson from our parts, who
    <lb/>kindly and pressingly invited us to quarter with them
    <lb/>which we accordingly did, &amp; were hospitably &amp; comfort-
    <lb/>ably accommodated, lodging in a Tent erected for the
    <lb/>purpose.

    <p>This morning parted with our pilot,
    <lb/><persName key="checkplace">John</persName>, &amp; set out for Canada, having first provided
    <lb/>a pasture for our Mare, till we return’d, crossed
    <lb/>Niagara about 8 OClock, which was one of the most
    <lb/>trying scenes particularly to one of us, that we have
    <lb/>yet met with, this River at the place of crossing is
    <lb/>about ¾ of a Mile in width, &amp; in some parts has a
    <lb/>strong current, our boat was old, &amp; very narrow &amp; one
    <lb/>of our horses unruly, which made our situation
    <lb/>ap-
        <lb/><pb n ="61" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_061"/>
    <lb/>appear really dangerous, but we were preserved, so as
    <lb/>to land safe.
   </p><p>We proceeded up the Lake for several Miles, then
    <lb/>leaving it a few Miles arrived at Dan’l Pounds,
    <lb/>where we dined; in the afternoon walked to Joel
    <lb/>Morris’s paid a friendly visit &amp; return’d; in the
    <lb/>evening rode to Asa Schooley’s about 3 Miles
    <lb/>further back from the Lake, where we lodged,
    <lb/>&amp; were kindly entertained.

    <p>This morning paid a friendly visit
    <lb/>to John Cutler &amp; family, returned to Asa Schooleys
    <lb/>attended their Meeting, which has been usually
    <lb/>held for some time back on first days, at this house
    <lb/>there were between 30 &amp; 40 individuals includg
    <lb/>children collected, their gathering was very ir-
    <lb/>regular, but their sitting in meeting exemplary,
    <lb/>still, &amp; in a good degree solid, yet the want of a
    <lb/>more lively exercise, &amp; religious travail was apparent.
   </p><p>In the afternoon we paid visits to Joseph Havens
    <lb/>Adam bunass &amp; Joseph Marsh, at the last of w’ch
    <lb/>we lodged.

    <p>About 7 this morning set out in order
    <lb/>to visit some friends in another settlement, before
    <lb/>the
        <lb/><pb n ="62" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_062"/>
    <lb/>the Falls, we rode about 7 Miles to the Niagara
    <lb/>River, thence down the same to the mouth of
    <lb/>Chipaway, which we crossed in a boat &amp; proceeding
    <lb/>down the Niagara, in about a Mile came to the
    <lb/>rapids preceding the great falls. The great body of
    <lb/>water which flows down this River together with the
    <lb/>roughness of the bottom &amp; the rapidity of the descent,
    <lb/>for more than a Mile above the grand pitch occasi-
    <lb/>ons such an amazing agitation, dashing &amp; foaming
    <lb/>of the water, as exhibit a sight both pleasing and
    <lb/>awful; when we arrived in the bank opposite the
    <lb/>grand pitch leaving our horses, we cautiously de-
    <lb/>scended a steep hill, we supposed of more than 100
    <lb/>feet in perpendicular height, near the bottom of w’ch
    <lb/>we found ourselves in a thick fog or mist &amp; shortly af-
    <lb/>ter in a fine rain, proceeding from the falls, we ap-
    <lb/>proached with careful step the edge of a great flat
    <lb/>rock nearly horizontal with the top of the pit6ch
    <lb/>&amp; hanging over the river below, whence we had a
    <lb/>good view at a few perches distance of the whole falls
    <lb/>except what was cover’d by the thick fog at all times
    <lb/>arising from the dashing of the Water. This fall
    <lb/>is said to be from 130 to 160 feet perpendicular &amp; is
    <lb/>a stupendous sight, not easily described, so as to
    <lb/>con
        <lb/><pb n ="63" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_063"/>
    <lb/>convey those sensations, which must accompany the
    <lb/>reflecting mind in the actual survey of it. The
    <lb/>continual rain &amp; coldness of this place would not
    <lb/>admit of a long indulgence to our curiosity, we
    <lb/>therefore shortly returned, ascended with some dif-
    <lb/>ficulty the aforesaid hill &amp; proceeded on our way
    <lb/>to Jeremy Moors, about 5 Miles from Chipaway,
    <lb/>here we got our horses shod &amp; lodged this night.
   </p><p>About an hour after our arrival here a
    <lb/>friend also arrived from a Settlement called the
    <lb/><emph>Shorthills</emph>, about 18 Miles from this place with
    <lb/>a message to Jeremy Moor &amp; others in the neighbour-
    <lb/>hood, that some uneasiness had taken place about
    <lb/>their meeting house, which they had been attempt-
    <lb/>ing to build in that place, in consequence of
    <lb/>which the work was stoped, and could not go further
    <lb/>forward, till something was done to accommodate
    <lb/>it some appeared to be seriously affected with this
    <lb/>business, as it apparently wore some aggravating
    <lb/>symptons &amp; expressed a particular desire that we
    <lb/>should attend a conference on the occasion, at the
    <lb/>Meeting house aforesaid some time tomorrow.
    <lb/>We agreed to take the subject under consideration
    <lb/>and to meet some of them at John Hills, about 6 Miles
    <lb/>on
        <lb/><pb n ="64" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_064"/>
    <lb/>on the way early in the morning, &amp; there to result whe-

    <p>Agreeably to the conclusion of yesterday
    <lb/>we early set out in company with Jeremy Moor &amp;
    <lb/>Wife to John Hills, where we got to breakfast, &amp;
    <lb/>after some further conference on the aforesaid uneasi-
    <lb/>ness, we concluded to attend a general conference with
    <lb/>all their members, and others concerned, at the Meeting
    <lb/>house aforesaid, and care was now taken to get notice
    <lb/>forward to meet as soon in the afternoon as conveni-
    <lb/>ency would admit. Soon after breakfast we set out
    <lb/>in company with John Hill &amp; Jeremy Moore on
    <lb/>horseback, several others going on foot arrived in
    <lb/>the neighbourhood about noon, went to Joshua
    <lb/>Gillharris where we left our horses &amp; walked to John
    <lb/>Taylors to dinner, after which went to the Meeting
    <lb/>house where we were met by all the men friends &amp;
    <lb/>others particularly concern’d &amp; after a time of solid
    <lb/>waiting &amp; travail of Spirit, strength was afforded
    <lb/>to treat the subject with great plainness &amp; affec-
    <lb/>tion, reminding them how tenderly they had been
    <lb/>cared for, both by the Father &amp; his Church, the se-
    <lb/>rious effects which must be consequent on their suf
    <lb/>fer

    <lb/>ferring divisions &amp; animosities to take place amongst
    <lb/>them in their present infant State, as well as the
    <lb/>reproach, both they and the profession they were
    <lb/>making must thereby incur amongst their
    <lb/>sober &amp; enquiring neighbours; which appeared
    <lb/>to have a reach on some minds, &amp; to prepare for a
    <lb/>salutacy discussion of particular circumstances
    <lb/>which was accordingly done, to the apparent res-
    <lb/>toration of harmony &amp; order, &amp; a day was now ap-
    <lb/>pointed to resume the work &amp; prosecute it with
    <lb/>attentive diligence. We returned from this con-
    <lb/>ference well satisfied that we had given up to at-
    <lb/>tend it, and divers expressed their thankfulness for
    <lb/>this timely &amp; unexpected assistance.
   </p><p>After this, we paid short visits to Saml Taylor
    <lb/>John Taylor Joshua Gillman &amp; went to James

    <lb/>this day.
   </p><p>At this place we had left most of our linen &amp; c. they

    <p>This morning about 8 OClock, took
    <lb/>leave of our kind Friends aforesaid, &amp; set out for Buf-
    <lb/>falo crossed the Niagara about one &amp; found it less
    <lb/>trying than before, as we prevailed upon the Ferry-
    <lb/>man to lash two boats together, which greatly contri-
    <lb/>buted to their steadiness &amp; apparently to our safety
    <lb/>soon after we landed, we met our pilot <persName key="checkplace">John</persName>, mounted
    <lb/>on our Mare, which we had left at <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName>, under
    <lb/>his care, he had ridden out on purpose to look for

    <lb/>is about 4 Miles from Buffalo aforesaid.
   </p><p>He manifested his gladness to see us, as we were also
    <lb/>to see him &amp; our creature safe.

   </p><p>We concluded to stay here this night &amp; to feel after

    <lb/>arrived, accompanied by a number of other Indians
    <lb/>from <placeName key="catta1">Catarawgus</placeName>; He expressed his gladness to meet

    <lb/>advantage to the Indians, by our stay would counter poise

   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>The difficulties of travelling through the
    <lb/>Wilderness, &amp; the tediousness of doing public busi-
    <lb/>ness, you must be perfectly acquainted with, by your
    <lb/>own experience, in your late Journey, in the good work
    <lb/>you have now been engaged in, and I hope you will
    <lb/>try to make your minds quiet &amp; easy to stay a few,
    <lb/>days with us, till our council can come on; that if
    <lb/>all things are right, so as to make our minds easy and
    <lb/>satisfied, we should be gald you should know it, that
    <lb/>you may tell it to your friends at home, &amp; if things
    <lb/>are not right, &amp; we cant be satisfied, we want you
    <lb/>to know it , so that you &amp; your friends may help to
    <lb/>get them right, adding that when we should conclude
    <lb/>to go he ished to say something to us, to carry in writing
    <lb/>to <placeName key="conan">Canandarque</placeName>.
    <lb/>We
        <lb/><pb n ="69" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_069"/>
    <lb/>We felt in some degree the pertinence of this reason
    <lb/>ing, but not being quite clear in our own minds what
    <lb/>was best on the occasion, we concluded to take the
    <lb/>subject closely under consideration till tomorrow
    <lb/>morning, &amp; inform'd him so, adding that we would
    <lb/>not go away without giving him notice, and an

    <p>This morning feeling our minds most easy
    <lb/>to move forward towards <placeName key="conan">Conandarque</placeName>; we had a con-
        <lb/>ference with <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, on the occasion observing to
    <lb/>him, that this was the last day of the week, that
    <lb/><persName key="ichap1">Cap Chapin</persName> &amp; others concerned were not yet come,
    <lb/>that tomorrow was first day, on which the white
    <lb/>people did not do business, that there was now no
    <lb/>probability, that they would set out from Conondarque
    <lb/>before second day, that they must be several days in
    <lb/>coming, so that the Council could not come on for
    <lb/>many days yet to come, that we had already been
    <lb/>longer out than we expected when we left home, that
    <lb/>we were anxious to get to our families, &amp; that we
    <lb/>hoped he would give us up to set out this morning
    <lb/>to which he observed, that he could not tell what
    <lb/>reasons we might have for our anxiety about get
    <lb/>in
    <lb/><pb n ="70" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_070"/>
    <lb/>ing home, but he knew it must be very agreeable
    <lb/>to us, as it also was to him, to be at home with our
    <lb/>families, but he had sometimes left home with
    <lb/>an expectation of returning in a few Weeks, &amp; had been
    <lb/>obliged to stay a whole year, that he thought it his
    <lb/>duty, in such cases to sacrifice his private inclina
    <lb/>tion to the public good, and that he wished we could
    <lb/>find it right to do so too, but at the same time giving
    <lb/>us to understand, that if we could not make our
    <lb/>minds easy to stay, that he would give us up with
    <lb/>out thinking hard.
   </p><p>We then inform’d him, that if we were certain of
    <lb/>being of any use to them, we could chearfully submit
    <lb/>to stay, even another week with them, but that we
    <lb/>had enquired into the business, &amp; had reason to hope,
    <lb/>that there was nothing intended but what was fair &amp; clear
    <lb/>&amp; that we were afraid, we should be spending our time
    <lb/>&amp; money without doing them any good, if we staid longer
    <lb/>&amp; that we were therefore most easy to proceed on our
    <lb/>journey. He then deliver’d a special message to
    <lb/><persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName>, which we took down in writing rela-
    <lb/>ting to some money he had advanced on account of
       <lb/>two Indians, who had been tried for murder at <placeName key="pitts">Pitts-

    <lb/>kindled up several fires, which have been afflictively
    <lb/>troublesome most of this day &amp; additionally so towards
    <lb/>evening; but all our efforts were ineffectual the
    <lb/>assaults of our little enemy were so incessant as to
    <lb/>admit of very little rest this night.

    <p>Left this place between four &amp; five in
    <lb/>the morning, proceeded on through a fat country,
    <lb/>with wet &amp; boggy roads, &amp; innumerable swarms of
    <lb/>Moschettoes for about 20 Miles, when we came in
        <lb/>sight of an house, thence to <placeName key="genes2">Chenesee River</placeName>, about 10
    <lb/>Miles - soon after we crossed this River we met with
        <lb/><persName key="jparr2">Gasper Parrish</persName> the Indian Interpreter, on his way
    <lb/>to <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName>; who inform’d that <persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName> had ac-
        <lb/><pb n ="72" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_072"/>
    <lb/>accompanied <persName key="jelic1">Joseph Ellicot</persName> to <placeName key="willi">Williamsburgh</placeName>, that he
    <lb/>had engaged to call on him at this place &amp; that he looked
    <lb/>for him here this evening, or soon in the morning. It was
    <lb/>therefore concluded best for one of us to stay here and wait
    <lb/>his arrival, whilst the other proceeded a few Miles further
    <lb/>to wait on some Men in the morning who had expressed
    <lb/>an inclination of purchasing our mare. This evening
       <lb/>wrote a letter to our friend at <placeName key="genes1">Genisenguhta</placeName>, informing
    <lb/>of our present state, &amp; the improbability of our being able
    <lb/>to send them a cow by the Indians as had been proposed.

    <p>About 10 this morning <persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName> ar-
    <lb/>rived; shortly after which obtain’d a conference with
        <lb/>him delivered <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanters</persName> message, &amp; presented him
    <lb/>with a brief narrative of our proceedings in the Indian
    <lb/>country with which he expressed the fullest approbation
    <lb/>and his good wishes for the success of the undertaking.
    <lb/>He then enquired after our settlement at <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> and
    <lb/>whether we would take that in our way home, adding
    <lb/>that on his last visit to that place, he was much pleas-
    <lb/>ed in observing the Improvement in that Nation
    <lb/>particularly with regard to fencing &amp; c. &amp; that he saw
    <lb/>numbers of the Men at work. He also informd that
    <lb/>he had empowered <persName key="checkplace">Abraham Vanaps</persName> to build a Grist
    <lb/>Mill for the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>, &amp; that he had rec’d a letter from

    <lb/>him stating that he had agreed with workmen to com-
    <lb/>plete the <del>work</del> business.
   </p><p>About 12 OClock took leave of <persName key="ichap1">Capt Chapin</persName> &amp;
    <lb/>others present &amp; proceeded on, came up with my com-
    <lb/>panion at a tavern 4 Miles forward, &amp; found our

    <lb/>we concluded to leave it on our right, &amp; take a few
    <lb/>friends, who lay nearly in our direction to <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>
    <lb/>making short stages amongst them, for this day &amp;

   </p><p>We soon found after our arrival at this place, that
    <lb/>our friends here were under considerable discourage-
    <lb/>ments in various respects. They have never been able
    <lb/>to obtain a general council with the Indians since
    <lb/>the arrival of <persName key="wgreg1">Wm Gregory</persName>, which is now about three
    <lb/>weeks
        <lb/><pb n ="75" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_075"/>
    <lb/>weeks; so that their letter of recommendation has not
    <lb/>been yet read amongst them, excepting to a few In-
    <lb/>dividuals, nor any way open’d for their being parti-
    <lb/>cularly useful to these people, in the way contem-
    <lb/>plated. Our friends also in the farming line, are
    <lb/>not without close trials, &amp; exercises with regard to
    <lb/>the state of their business, one of them having been
    <lb/>sick most of this Spring, and no Indians having
    <lb/>yet joined them to work in the way proposed by
    <lb/>our Articles they have been obliged to hire this season
    <lb/>to the Amo’r of 100 Dollars &amp; upwards, &amp; that often
    <lb/>attended with disagreeable circumstances such as
    <lb/>murmuring at their wages, &amp; coming to work in too
    <lb/>great numbers, at a time, some days near 30 have
    <lb/>offered &amp; been received.
   </p><p>We also learn, the accounts are not yet settled,
    <lb/>with the <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge nation</orgName> with regard to our ad-
    <lb/>vance towards their Mill, nor any of the Money
    <lb/>received; and there is some cause to fear all things

    <lb/>concerning the Money he rec’d from Governm’t at <placeName key="phila">Philada</placeName>
   </p><p>Our friends here were also persuaded that some ad-
    <lb/>vantageous change might be made in the arrange
    <lb/>ments
        <lb/><pb n ="76" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_076"/>
    <lb/>ments, relative to the young Indians working with
    <lb/>them on the farm, but were under doubts of the recti-
    <lb/>tude of their adopting any thing new, without instruc-
    <lb/>tions from the Committee on the occasion.
   </p><p>We believed it best to spend some days in this place
    <lb/>&amp; to feel &amp; sympathise with our friends under their va
    <lb/>rious trials, and notwithstanding we had no powers
    <lb/>from our friends at home, relative to things here, we
    <lb/>believed the urgency of the occasion would justify us
    <lb/>in joining with them in a serious consideration of
    <lb/>what might be profitably proposed to the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>
    <lb/>on the subject of their young Men working on the
    <lb/>Farm with our Friends, as well as the necessary arrange-
    <lb/>ments relative to <persName key="wgreg1">Wm Gregories</persName> prospect as a Smith
    <lb/>together with our concerns at <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName>.

    <p>This day set out for <placeName key="stock">Stockbridge</placeName> in com-
    <lb/>pany with <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> called in at many of their
    <lb/>houses, &amp; paid short visits, with which they mani-
    <lb/>fested great satisfaction &amp; pleasure as most of them know
    <lb/>one of us, who had before spent several Weeks in that
    <lb/>place: we visited <persName key="jquin2">John Quiney</persName> in his school which
    <lb/>was conducted with becoming solidity and order, went
    <lb/>to see their Mills, which appear well constructed, and
    <lb/>ca
        <lb/><pb n ="77" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_077"/>
    <lb/>capable of doing a good deal of work<del>s</del>; we also paid a
    <lb/>visit to <persName key="jserg2">John Sergent</persName>, their Treasurer presented our
    <lb/>bill of advance toward their Mill, &amp; were informed
    <lb/>there was not Money enough in his hands to settle it.
    <lb/>we also discover’d that he had indulged hopes, notwith-
    <lb/>standing the clearness of our articles, of retaining a
    <lb/>considerable part of what was in his <del>own</del> hands, for
    <lb/>some other appropriations to him more desirable.
    <lb/>We gave him to understand that when we entered into
    <lb/>articles, we always expected to fulfil them on our parts
    <lb/>&amp; we wished others to do so by us, adding, that our design
    <lb/>was to assist &amp; encourage them in getting a Mill,
    <lb/>which we had effected &amp; if government had advanced
    <lb/>nothing towards it, we should not have been hard
    <lb/>with them, about their deficiency in fulfilling their
    <lb/>part of the Agreement, but as Government had now
    <lb/>advanced so considerable a Sum, we were most easy
    <lb/>to receive our own, agreeable to the Article, &amp; ap-
    <lb/>propriate it to those of their Brethren, who appear’d
    <lb/>more necessitous, He readily acknowledged the just-
    <lb/>ness of this conclusion &amp; promised to attend at <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>
    <lb/>on third day next, in company with such of the
    <lb/><orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> chiefs &amp; others as were concerned in this
    <lb/>bu-
        <lb/><pb n ="78" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_078"/>
    <lb/>business, in order to have it settled.
   </p><p>After this conference we went to <persName key="haupa1">Capt Hendricks</persName>
    <lb/>where we dined, his wife <persName key="lhend1">Lydia</persName> being much rejoiced to
    <lb/>see us, she having undergone some heavy &amp; piercing
    <lb/>trials these some weeks past.
   </p><p>We now drew a Bond, &amp; had it executed by
    <lb/>Capt Hendrick for 100 Dollars agreeably to the
       <lb/>instructions in Henry Drinkers letter to <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName>
    <lb/>&amp; placed the same to the credit of their Acco’.
   </p><p>In the evening had an opportunity with most
    <lb/>of the principal Men &amp; Women of this tribe at the
    <lb/>House of <persName key="jquin2">John Quiny</persName> in which we were favour’d with
    <lb/>some encouraging communications to a number of tried
    <lb/>individuals as well as some affectionate &amp; close reasoning
    <lb/>with some of their leading Men on the serious import-
    <lb/>ance of their setting a good example to the rest of their
    <lb/>people not only in the mere exteriors of civilization,
    <lb/>such as farming &amp; c. but in the more interesting, that
    <lb/>of a moral &amp; good life, the necessity of a renewed dili-
    <lb/>gence &amp; watchfulness herein some recent Instances
    <lb/>but too sorrowfully evince. At the close of this
    <lb/>opportunity both Men &amp; Women expressed their
    <lb/>sat-

    <lb/>satisfaction with what had been said &amp; their desires to

    <lb/>that they now felt their minds encouraged as it were

    <lb/>informing that many of their people were gone out a

   </p><p>We then read the following propositions which
    <lb/>had this morning been agreed upon &amp; signed by all

   </p>
    <floatingText type="speech">
     <body>
    <p>Brothers of the <orgName key="oneida">Oneida Nation</orgName>
    <lb/>You have now heard in the letter which has
    <lb/>been read to you that our friend <persName key="wgreg1">Wm Gregory</persName> is come
    <lb/>amongst you in order to assist and instruct some of your young
    <lb/>Men in the useful trade of a Smith, he wants no pay
    <lb/>from you, nor from Government for his trouble, but
    <lb/>wishes you to provide a shop &amp; some coal for the
    <lb/>purpose (<persName key="ichap1">Cap. Chapin</persName> having offered to find Iron as
    <lb/>usual) &amp; that two of your young Men who want to
    <lb/>learn
        <lb/><pb n ="81" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_081"/>
    <lb/>learn the trade should steadily attend at the Shop to
    <lb/>do such Smith work as you may want done, &amp; he
    <lb/>will attend with them &amp; assist them, and shew them
    <lb/>how to do it, &amp; in order to encourage these young men
    <lb/>to stick steadily to the work, so as to do all the Smithing
    <lb/>you want done, &amp; to learn the Trade well before our
    <lb/>friend wants to go back again to his own people, we
    <lb/>think you might allow them such part of the money
    <lb/>Government used to give to your blacksmith, as will
    <lb/>enable them to buy themselves victuals and clothes
    <lb/>while they are learning the trade &amp; doing your work.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We hope you will get things ready soon, &amp;
    <lb/>that your young Men will begin soon in this busi-
    <lb/>ness for our friend dont want to stay a great while
    <lb/>here only just long enough to learn some of your
    <lb/>young Men this good trade.
   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>You remember that two years ago, we pro-
    <lb/>posed to you, that some of your young Men should
    <lb/>work on the farm with our friends as apprentices in
    <lb/>order to learn them how to farm the ground like the
    <lb/>white people, so that they might raise a great deal
    <lb/>of
        <lb/><pb n ="82" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_082"/>
    <lb/>of grain &amp; grass &amp; c. off of your good land Now brothers
    <lb/>you know, two years are gone &amp; none of your young
    <lb/>Men are come forward to work with our friends as we
    <lb/>proposed &amp; we understand your young Men say they
    <lb/>cant get victuals to stick steadily to their Work and
    <lb/>therefore they cant do as we proposed, we will now make
    <lb/>you another offer.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>If three or four of your sober young Men
    <lb/>above the age of 16 years, will come &amp; work with our
    <lb/>friends on the farm, &amp; stay with them six Months, we
    <lb/>will agree to board &amp; lodge them, they must stick stea
    <lb/>dily to work five days in a Week, the other day they
    <lb/>may have to themselves to go &amp; see their friends &amp; c.
    <lb/>they must be sober, &amp; mind what our friends say to
    <lb/>them, &amp; do the work as our friends tell them it should
    <lb/>be done, &amp;  not go off &amp; quit their work without speak-
    <lb/>ing to our friends about it, &amp; knowing whether they
    <lb/>are willing; &amp; they must not go out at night a frolicking
    <lb/>but stay about home, so as to be ready to go to bed, at our
    <lb/>friends common bed time. And if these young Men
    <lb/>stay the six Months out, &amp; behave well in the manner
    <lb/>before mention’d then our friends will give each of them
    <lb/>stuff for one cloth coat, 2 Shirts one pair cloth leggons
    <lb/>five
        <lb/><pb n ="83" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_083"/>
    <lb/>five Bushels of Wheat, 10 bushels of Indian corn and
    <lb/>10 Bushels of Potatoes; and if they will the go to farm-
    <lb/>ing for themselves &amp; their Chiefs will let them have
    <lb/>separate Lots of ground to fence off for that purpose
    <lb/>then our friends will lend each of them a plough with
    <lb/>Irons all complete, for one year &amp; by that time they
    <lb/>may be able to get some for themselves &amp; then these
    <lb/>must be return’d, so that other young beginners may
    <lb/>have them.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We shall give a copy of these pro-
    <lb/>positions in writing signed with our names, to
    <lb/>your chiefs, &amp; another copy will be left with our
    <lb/>friends here, &amp; if any of your young Men agree
    <lb/>to begin to work with our friends as we propose
    <lb/>they may set their names to these writings, so that
    <lb/>both sides may understand every thing plain &amp; clear
    <lb/>&amp; have it all in writing to keep our memories bright.

    <lb/>After reading these propositions we let them know in
    <lb/>very plain terms that we were sensibly affected with
    <lb/>the manifest coldness &amp; inattention which had latterly
    <lb/>appeared amongst them towards our friends; the un-
    <lb/>grateful whisperings &amp; surmises that they had given
    <lb/>way to, relative to our having a design to take away their land
    <lb/>from them, reminding them of the various steps we had
    <lb/>taken amongst them from the beginning, the great
    <lb/>expence we were at in maintaining our freinds here
    <lb/>amongst them, the improvements we were making on
    <lb/>their lands, which they saw with their own eyes, the
    <lb/>wheat &amp; the clover that they saw growing where there
    <lb/>used to be none, the Barn that was built, &amp; the house
    <lb/>that was on its way, that all these things could not
    <lb/>be done without a great deal of Money; that we had
    <lb/>never asked them for any nor never should that we
    <lb/>had never asked them for any of their land, nor would
    <lb/>we take it <del>from</del> of them if they would offer it to us, that
    <lb/>we had told them before &amp; would now tell them again
    <lb/>that when ever they were tired of us, &amp; wished us away
    <lb/>only tell us so, and we would leave both their land
    <lb/>&amp; their Country, that we had no inducement to stay
    <lb/>here amongst them spending both our time &amp; money
    <lb/>but purely for their good.

    <lb/>We will say a few words to you about the
    <lb/>Blacksmith, which is come from <placeName key="phila">Philada</placeName> to in-
    <lb/>struct us in the trade, You know we dont govern
    <lb/>our young Men If they arnt willing to come, we
    <lb/>cant force them, but we want to know how he in-
    <lb/>tends to work; whether for the Indians in common
    <lb/>or whether he will do so much a day, &amp; give it into
    <lb/>the hands of the Chiefs to be divided amongst the
    <lb/>people, adding that if he worked for the indians
    <lb/>in general; it would be too hard for him for they
    <lb/>would be always plaguing him.
   </p>

    <p>To this we replied, That the design of our friend
    <lb/>in coming here was to instruct their young Men
    <lb/>&amp; shew them how to do their work &amp; not to do it all
    <lb/>himself, and tho’ we did not wish them to force
    <lb/>their young Men yet if they could not be prevail’d
    <lb/>upon to come forward in the way proposed, our
    <lb/>friends prospect would not be answer’d and he
    <lb/>would therefore be likely to make but a short
    <lb/>stay with them, but as to the manner of working
    <lb/>our
        <lb/><pb n ="86" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_086"/>
    <lb/>our friend would leave that to the Chiefs.

   <p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We are very glad to hear again the same
    <lb/>words, which you said to us two years ago, &amp; we are
    <lb/>now of the same mind we were then; we remember
    <lb/>your words, &amp; we believe you are a true people. We
    <lb/>have heard our fathers tell that the Quakers were always
    <lb/>friends to the Indians &amp; what they told us when we
    <lb/>were boys, we find to be true now we are old Men.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We are very glad &amp; happy to hear that your
    <lb/>minds continue the same towards us about learning
    <lb/>to farm: we believe it would be good for us &amp; we will
    <lb/>try to do what you propose.
   </p><p>Brothers
    <lb/>Now it is very true there are some bad
    <lb/>people, who have spoke against you that you
    <lb/>had a mind to take away our Land; &amp; sometimes
    <lb/>when our Minds were not right, we believe such talk,
    <lb/>&amp; this made our minds feel very ugly, but now
    <lb/>we are con<del>cerned</del>vinced &amp; sorry we believed such things
    <lb/>&amp; we are fully satisfied that you are true people &amp;
    <lb/>we will continue to be of this mind.

   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We always attend to what you said from
    <lb/>the beginning, we know you want us to cultivate
    <lb/>the ground, so that we may live comfortably, and
    <lb/>our wishes &amp; desires are to do what you say as far as
    <lb/>we are able, &amp; to learn the farming business, We
    <lb/>the Chiefs are determined to do all that we are
    <lb/>able, but if we dont do all that you would wish,
    <lb/>we hope you wont get discouraged; but continue
    <lb/>to do what ever is in your minds &amp; if we dont im-
    <lb/>prove, then the fault will be our own we cant
    <lb/>blame you.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We will do all that we can about the Black
    <lb/>Smith, &amp; about the farming; we cant force our
    <lb/>young Men; but we will try all round, all of us
    <lb/>will try to get some young Men to learn this trade
    <lb/>&amp; to learn farming.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>Now we thank you for the pains you
    <lb/>have taken for poor Indians, &amp; we will have council
    <lb/>amongst ourselves tomorrow, after we have tried
    <lb/>what
        <lb/><pb n ="88" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_088"/>
    <lb/>what we can do, &amp; then we will speak to you again
    <lb/>about it.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>This is all we got to say at present.

    <p>We expressed our satisfaction with what they

    <lb/>came this day to <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> in order to settle the accounts
    <lb/>respecting the Mill. The several Sums advanced by
    <lb/>our committee towards this Mill amounted /exclu-
    <lb/>sive of the 100 Dollars lent to <persName key="haupa1">Capt Hendricks</persName> for the use
    <lb/>of his nation about 3 years ago/ to 559 Dollars 47 Cents
    <lb/>against which was credited the 100 Dollars now lent
    <lb/>to Capt Hendrick, &amp; their treasurer informs that only
    <lb/>370 Dollars, of the 1000 rec’d by Capt Hendrick had
    <lb/>come into his hands; 52 of which he had laid out, but
    <lb/>was willing to give his own private Note, payable or
    <lb/>on demand, to <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> for that sum; which was
    <lb/>agreed to, &amp; a Note drawn &amp; executed accordingly. He
    <lb/>then paid in money on behalf of the nation 318 Dollars
    <lb/>&amp; took a receipt from Jacob Taylor, for the 370 he had
    <lb/>been entrusted with.
    <lb/>There

    <lb/>There now remained a balance of 89 Dolrs 47 Cents
    <lb/>/exclusive of <persName key="haupa1">Capt Hendricks</persName> two bonds for 100 Dollars

    <lb/>which should come into his hands for the use of their

    <lb/>get it sign’d by their chiefs &amp; return it to us at <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>
    <lb/>tomorrow morning.
   </p><p>It may be proper to Note here that there appears
    <lb/>reason to fear the 100 Dollars lent to Capt Hendrick
    <lb/>as an assistance in building his House, together
    <lb/>with about 20 more of the nations money, was ex-
    <lb/>pended before he got home; the remainder of 630

    <lb/>conference amongst themselves, they spoke to us to
    <lb/>the following effect.
   </p>
    <floatingText type="speech">
       <body><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>You have heard what we said to you
    <lb/>yesterday, and what is still on our minds: we are very
    <lb/>glad you have taken such pains to come so far to
    <lb/>help poor Indians &amp; we will try to fulfil all you
    <lb/>desire of us.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>We have been trying amongst ourselves
    <lb/>to do as you proposed to us yesterday, &amp; we find one
    <lb/>Man that is willing to learn the Black Smith Trade,
    <lb/>and we find one young lad, that will come out of his
    <lb/>own mind, to learn farming; he heard what you said
    <lb/>yesterday in council, and he spoke to his parents, &amp;
    <lb/>tell them he wants to go &amp; learn farming &amp; do as you
    <lb/>say, and his parents are willing, &amp; he will come di-
    <lb/>rectly.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>Now you must not think hard of us,
    <lb/>because we ha’nt got so many young Men as you
    <lb/>proposed; we have tried to get more, but most all
    <lb/>our people from the other end of the town are gone
    <lb/>outa fishing When they come home, we think we
    <lb/>shall
        <lb/><pb n ="91" facs="hv_js_diary_v1_1798_091"/>
    <lb/>shall get more, and we will do the best we can.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>You mentioned about a Blacksmiths Shop,
    <lb/>and about coal, now we intend to go at the Shop
    <lb/>early tomorrow morning we have got the bark ready
    <lb/>to cover it, &amp; we shall have it done tomorrow, and
    <lb/>some will go to drawing wood for the coal.
   </p><p>Brothers,
    <lb/>This is all we got to say,
   </p>
     </body>
 </floatingText>
    <p>We expressed our satisfaction with what they had
    <lb/>said, &amp; let them know that we were very glad to see
    <lb/>their chiefs of the same mind with us in this business
    <lb/>&amp; we were in hopes they would continue to be of
    <lb/>this mind.
   </p><p>We closed with renewedly reminding them of
    <lb/>the obligations they were under to our friends, who
    <lb/>remain here; who have left all their near friends
    <lb/>&amp; connections to come &amp; live amongst them, purely
    <lb/>from a desire to do them good; &amp; earnestly entreating
    <lb/>them to keep this fresh in their minds &amp; then we
    <lb/>were certain they would be attentive &amp; kind to them
    <lb/>at all times.
