     <p><date when="1799-02-03">Second Month 3rd</date>.This mor-
        <lb/>ning being the first day of the week.
     </p><p>When in <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter's</persName> house, his
        <lb/>Son <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName> and about a dozen of his peo-
        <lb/>ple being present, several of them petty
        <lb/>Chiefs; Who wanted me to tell them
        <lb/>how the World and things therein
        <lb/>were Created at first.
     </p><p>I immediately applied my heart
        <lb/>with fervent breathings to the Lord
        <lb/>for His aid and support; in this
        <lb/>Question; and found him a present
        <lb/>help.
     </p><p>I told them it was a hard Questi-
        <lb/>on; I understood it better than I
        <lb/>was able to explain it to them.
        <lb/>but I would endeavour to satisfy
        <lb/>them,
        <lb/><pb n="5" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_005"/>
        <lb/>them, and told them there is a certain
        <lb/>good Book, called the Holy Scriptures,
        <lb/>which very few, who can read, will dare
        <lb/>to deny its being true, which gives us
        <lb/>an account, of the World being made
        <lb/>and of all living Creatures both in water
        <lb/>and on land, by the great Spirit, and
        <lb/>also the first man &amp; Woman whom
        <lb/>the great spirit created of the dust of
        <lb/>the earth and breathed into them the
        <lb/>breath of Life, and they became living
        <lb/>Souls, who had two sons, one of them
        <lb/>was a good man, and the other Wicked
        <lb/>who kiled his Brother, because he
        <lb/>was more righteous than himself.
        <lb/>and askt them if they did not see it
        <lb/>so now a days; that wicked people
        <lb/>envy good ones, and at times were
        <lb/>ready to take their lives. I told
        <lb/>them that the great Spirit, made all
        <lb/>these things, in six days, and on the
        <lb/>seventh
        <lb/><pb n="6" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_006"/>
        <lb/>Seventh He rested from all His Labor
        <lb/>the day we now rest from our Labour
        <lb/>to serve and Worship him, wherein he
        <lb/>blessed us, and made us happy, insomuch
        <lb/>that we hold two days in the week for
        <lb/>to Worship him, and in so doing, he
        <lb/>comforts our hearts, and preserve us
        <lb/>in Love and Unity one with another.
        <lb/>I desired it might be the case with them.
     </p><p>I supposed some of them, doubted our
        <lb/>knowing these Holy wrightings to be
        <lb/>true, and told them, that the way
        <lb/>I had to know it was, by reading of
        <lb/>them, and as the great Spirit pleased to
        <lb/>make them manifest in the secret of
        <lb/>my heart, teling me they are true, and
        <lb/>making me sensible of it, even to that degree
        <lb/>at times, of causing tears to flow
        <lb/>from mine Eyes when I have read
        <lb/>them; and told them it was the
        <lb/>only
        <lb/><pb n="7" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_007"/>
        <lb/>only way I had to know when I was doing
        <lb/>right or wrong, by strictly attending to
        <lb/>the great Spirit in my heart, and
        <lb/>asked them, if this was not the case
        <lb/>when they thought of doing something
        <lb/>which they ought not to do, whether they
        <lb/>did not feel something pricking at their
        <lb/>Hearts, and telling them not to do so.
     </p><p>Several of the Chiefs, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
        <lb/>for one; confest it was the very tru-
        <lb/>th, they had experienced it so.
     </p><p>I told them it was the great Spirit
        <lb/>that thus pricked, and tells us not
        <lb/>to do so, and it is the Devil that
        <lb/>urges us to do it.
     </p><p>I then told them, here would be an
        <lb/>advantage to their Children, in learn-
        <lb/>ing to read, as the great Spirit pla-
        <lb/>sed to enlighten their understand
        <lb/>ings and make them sensible of this
        <lb/>good Book; as well as many other
        <lb/><pb n="8" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_008"/>
        <lb/>benefits which will be likely to attend
        <lb/>their Children, thus being Educated.
     </p><p>After some time they informed
        <lb/>me, that there was not one of them
        <lb/>who had any objections to what I had
        <lb/>said, but were satisfied, and thought
        <lb/>if I would mention it to the rest, it
        <lb/>might be of use to them; who were averse
        <lb/>to their Children being Educated.
        <lb/>
     </p><p>After this meeting my School
        <lb/>was much Larger than before, be-
        <lb/>tween 20 &amp; 30, several of them Men
        <lb/>grow, and some of them anxious
        <lb/>to learn, though many of them
        <lb/>very tedious, which kept me so
        <lb/>faithful in Teaching them, that
        <lb/>at times I have been almost weary
        <lb/>in well doing.
     </p><p><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> informed me
        <lb/>that
        <lb/><pb n="9" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_009"/>
        <lb/>That when a young man, he was a
        <lb/>great Hunter, and often thought of
        <lb/>the great Spirit, who made the Wild
        <lb/>beasts and all things, and to be sure
        <lb/>he had always very good luck, he said.
     </p><p>I told him that was the only way
        <lb/>to receive a blessing by thinking of, and
        <lb/>returning thanks to the great Spirit,
        <lb/>even the Farmers, were then blest
        <lb/>with better Crops of Grain.

     <p><date when="1799-02-11">2nd. Mo. 11th</date> Second day of the
        <lb/>Week, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> &amp; two of his Sons
        <lb/>came up early in the morning, to the
        <lb/>house where I lodged. Who told me
        <lb/>he had something particular to commu-
        <lb/>nicate, which was thus, they had lately
        <lb/>received an Express from the <orgName key="buffc2">Buf-
        <lb/>falo Indians</orgName>; that one of their little
        <lb/>girls had Dreamed, the Devil was
        <lb/>in all white people alike, and that
        <lb/>the
        <lb/><pb n="10" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_010"/>
        <lb/>the Quakers were doing no good
        <lb/>among them, but otherwise, and it
        <lb/>was not right for their children to
        <lb/>learn to read &amp; write. Wherefore
        <lb/>they had held a council yesterday
        <lb/>on the Subject; And many of his peo-
        <lb/>ple were so foolish as to believe it
        <lb/>was true, for many of them put great
        <lb/>confidence in their Dreams. but
        <lb/>he did not believe it, and had got very
        <lb/>tired of hearing so much noise about
        <lb/>their Dreams. He wished me not to
        <lb/>be discouraged, for he intended to make
        <lb/>his people do better.
     </p><p>I told him l did not feel uneasy
        <lb/>at all about it; for I thought I knew
        <lb/>from whence it had originated, I
        <lb/>knew that Farmers Brother
        <lb/>and others of the <orgName key="buffc2">Buffalo Indians</orgName>
        <lb/>were much injured &amp; set against
        <lb/>the Quakers, through the instigati
        <lb/><pb n="11" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_011"/>
        <lb/>on of some had white people about them,
        <lb/>he said that was very true.
     </p><p>I told him it was a certainly a very
        <lb/>good work from the great Spirit;
        <lb/>therefore I knew the Devil would use
        <lb/>his utmost endeavours to lay it waist
        <lb/>for I had experienced from a very lit-
        <lb/>tle Boy, that he is always seeking and
        <lb/>ready to distroy all that is good. but as
        <lb/>it is a Work from the great Spirit, I
        <lb/>believed, He would support and carry
        <lb/>it on to his own Glory.
     </p><p>He said, that some of the white
        <lb/>people were as much to blame, as
        <lb/>the Indians; which was the reason
        <lb/>the Devil came so often; for when
        <lb/>they wanted to get their Land, they
        <lb/>would go to some of the worst among
        <lb/>them, and make a bargain first, and
        <lb/>afterwards apply to the Chiefs.
        <lb/>I believed that to be true. I
        <lb/><pb n="12" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_012"/>
        <lb/>I told him I would continue teaching
        <lb/>them that would come. And as for
        <lb/>the rest, we would let them Quietly
        <lb/>alone. perhaps the great Spirit would
        <lb/>open their eyes, and enlighten their
        <lb/>understanding, so they might behold
        <lb/>the nonsensicalness of such Dreams &amp;
        <lb/>Stories, Who could if he pleased, change
        <lb/>their thoughts, in an hours time.
     </p><p>The school was a little small-
        <lb/>er for one day. But afterwards
        <lb/>was larger than it had been at all.

     <p><date when="1799-02-27">2nd. month 27th.</date> This Day proved
        <lb/>a very trying and painful one, to
        <lb/>my Soul, by reason of a prospect of
        <lb/>an approaching Dance &amp; Frolick
        <lb/>among the Indians, Some of which
        <lb/>l had behend before with great grief,
        <lb/>tho not too so great a degree as at
        <lb/>this time. they had been in
        <lb/>the
        <lb/><pb n="13" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_013"/>
        <lb/>the
        <lb/>practice for many weeks back every two
        <lb/>or three Days or nights; And at this
        <lb/>time were preparing in <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanters</persName>
        <lb/>House (where I was employed teaching the
        <lb/>Children) two Large Kettles of provisions
        <lb/>for the purpose, which would hold
        <lb/>near or quite a Barrel apiece; and
        <lb/>while l was thus engaged, a person
        <lb/>informed the Scollars thereoff which
        <lb/>put them in such an agitation l was
        <lb/>scarcely able to teach them at any
        <lb/>rate, Some of them left the School
        <lb/>and went home to prepare for the
        <lb/>Dance; this being the second time of
        <lb/>my being so served. After I let
        <lb/>out School, l went into the Woods
        <lb/>and fell several large Trees, for
        <lb/>the Women for fire Wood, which
        <lb/>had been my frequent practice
        <lb/>During the Winter, when l retu
        <lb/>rned
        <lb/><pb n="14" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_014"/>
        <lb/>returned to the house, by this time they
        <lb/>had got into the career of their folly
        <lb/>a Large Concourse of Men and Boys danc-
        <lb/>ing and shouting in an astonishing man-
        <lb/>ner with some Musical Instrument
        <lb/>some of which were Large Water
        <lb/>Tortals Dried dried with the Entrails taken
        <lb/>out, and Corn put in the place there-
        <lb/>off the neck stretched which serves
        <lb/>for a handle. Divers Women
        <lb/>were Collected, who appeared only
        <lb/>as Spectators, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> having
        <lb/>two Long buildings like under one roof
        <lb/>which were Occupied as Dwellings.
        <lb/>l entered into the most vacant one,
        <lb/>where I found him, his Son <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName> &amp;
        <lb/>most of his Family, were sitting.
        <lb/>I acquainted him, of the painful
        <lb/>exercises which l had Laboured
        <lb/>under at various times, on account
        <lb/>of
        <lb/><pb n="15" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_015"/>
        <lb/>of their many Dancing Frolicks, and
        <lb/>it had appeared much more exercising
        <lb/>to me that Day than it had hitherto.
        <lb/>I endeavoured to assert to him
        <lb/>the Evil thereoff, and that it was
        <lb/>certainly the Devils works; and
        <lb/>they who did so, were serving of him,
        <lb/>and told him, I thought, every Man
        <lb/>had a right to be Master of his own
        <lb/>House, and before I would suffer
        <lb/>such things in mine, I would burn
        <lb/>it to ashes &amp; live in a cave, and
        <lb/>did hope I might never see any more
        <lb/>of it amongst them; further told
        <lb/>him, what made it more painful
        <lb/>to me was, they Collected the ino-
        <lb/>cent Children and were bringing
        <lb/>them up in their footsteps, in
        <lb/>doing that which was so very
        <lb/>wicked
        <lb/><pb n="16" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_016"/>
        <lb/>Wicked, when it ought to be otherwise &amp; c.
        <lb/>more I said to him, nearly to the same
        <lb/>purport; in a very broken manner
        <lb/>to the amazement (I believe) of many
        <lb/>of the spectators. He told me
        <lb/>he could not say much about it, at
        <lb/>the present; but would converse
        <lb/>on the subject the next Day; I
        <lb/>then retired to my house of lodging.
     </p><p>And on the morrow, I went
        <lb/>as usual, in order to teach School
        <lb/>where I found a Large number of
        <lb/>them collected in council, in the
        <lb/>very house, I entered into the
        <lb/>other apartment, and as I sat
        <lb/>the subject of poor Mordecai
        <lb/>was livingly brought to my rem-
        <lb/>embrance, When as he sat at
        <lb/>the Kings gate waiting to see how

        <lb/><pb n="17" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_017"/>
        <lb/>After a while I was called in, and went
        <lb/>with great willingness, tho in much fear,
        <lb/><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> informed me they had been
        <lb/>counciling, on the subject, which I had
        <lb/>mentioned the evening before, and
        <lb/>had concluded, (although they did not
        <lb/>all see alike) to quit such Dancing
        <lb/>Frolicks, for some of them thought it must
        <lb/>be wicked, because they had learned it
        <lb/>of white people, as well as that of
        <lb/>drinking Rum or Wiskey &amp; getting
        <lb/>Drunk, which they knew was Evil, for
        <lb/>there is no kind of Dance, Original-
        <lb/>ly amongst Indians;  but they had
        <lb/>a Hussleing kind of play and dance too twice a year of their own
        <lb/>production Originally, which
        <lb/>they thought to continue in the
        <lb/>practice off. They asked me
        <lb/>several questions.
       <list> <item>1st Whether
        <lb/>I thought it was right for Indians
        <lb/>&amp; White people to mix in marry-
        <lb/>ing
        <lb/><pb n="18" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_018"/>
        <lb/>ing, I told them it was a had Question.
        <lb/>It might be right for some to marry
        <lb/>so, but thought it would not be right
        <lb/>for me. </item>
      <item>2nd. Whether Indians and White peo-
        <lb/>ple, went together to the same
        <lb/>place after Death. I told them
        <lb/>there was but two places, a place
        <lb/>for the Good and a place
        <lb/>for the Bad, of all Nations of People &amp; c.
      </item>
      <item>3rd. Whether all would be of one
        <lb/>language, When there, I answer-
        <lb/>ed yes. They seemed satisfied. </item>
          </list>
        <lb/>They informed me of one of their Wo-
        <lb/>men who had a child by a white Man
        <lb/>who then resided at <placeName key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName>, and
        <lb/>never came to see any thing about his Child
        <lb/>they thought the Great Spirit inten-
        <lb/>ded that every man should take
        <lb/>care &amp; maintain his own Children.
        <lb/>I arose (the Interpreter also) and
        <lb/>made
        <lb/><pb n="19" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_019"/>
        <lb/>a long speech to them, Opening
        <lb/>more clearly the Evil of many cus-
        <lb/>toms prevailing among them, parti-
        <lb/>cularly that of Dancing, &amp; Shouting
        <lb/>in such an hideous manner which
        <lb/>they are accustomed too. As there
        <lb/>were many then presnt who did not
        <lb/>here me the Evining before; while
        <lb/>thus engaged I experienced the God
        <lb/>of Israel, to be my present help,
        <lb/>Who brought me into such a broken
        <lb/>State, that I believe some then
        <lb/>present were fully convinced, and
        <lb/>many of their Dark Hearts, more
        <lb/>enlightened. The Council con-
        <lb/>tinued untill Dark, I then returned
        <lb/>to my house of Lodging.
     </p><p>On the preceding morning, the
        <lb/>Old Chief, two of his sons &amp; divers
        <lb/>others, Came to my lodging abode,
        <lb/>who informed me he came on pur-
        <lb/>pose
        <lb/><pb n="20" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_020"/>
        <lb/>pose to tell me something particular whi
        <lb/>ch he did not the day before; as some
        <lb/>of his People did not see &amp; think as
        <lb/>he did, as for his own part he had
        <lb/>a great regard for the Quakers, and
        <lb/>could find no fault with me, or my
        <lb/>companions, but felt happy we
        <lb/>were among them, and had before
        <lb/>several times, expressed a gladness
        <lb/>of my being with him, and he hoped
        <lb/>we might live a long while together.
        <lb/>He also said that when he first saw
        <lb/>us coming to his house, he was glad and thanked
        <lb/>the great Spirit at that time, whom
        <lb/>he thought must have brought us
        <lb/>thither.
     </p><p>He further said there was a number
        <lb/>of Boys, &amp; some Girls, some of whom
        <lb/>were then present, whom they intended
        <lb/>should attend the School steadily, and
        <lb/>would give up the boys into my care
        <lb/>to
        <lb/><pb n="21" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_021"/>
        <lb/>to do by them, as I would by my own
        <lb/>Son, he wished me to learn them to
        <lb/>work, and correct them as they de-
        <lb/>served, even his own Children.
     </p><p>And also if I wanted any of the
        <lb/>young men, to go to <placeName key="genes1">Genesinguhtau</placeName>
        <lb/>or do any business, which I thought
        <lb/>would be of advantage to them, I
        <lb/>should Command them, and he
        <lb/>mentioned one or too, who were
        <lb/>then present, for that purpose.
     </p><p>Thus he seemed in a manner
        <lb/>willing to resign his own com-
        <lb/>mission to me. I acknowledg-
        <lb/>ed his love and tender regard
        <lb/>towards me, And left truly
        <lb/>thankful to the Lord, for these
        <lb/>Favours.
     </p><p>In this Council, a young Man
        <lb/>informed the Company, of a Dream
        <lb/>which
        <lb/><pb n="22" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_022"/>
        <lb/>which he Dreamt a few nights before,
        <lb/>when out in the Woods Hunting, in Com-
        <lb/>pany with a Lad.
     </p><p>He thought an Indian struck him
        <lb/>twice with a Knife, when he fell and
        <lb/>thought he must Die, but soon appeared
        <lb/>to ascend upwards, some distance
        <lb/>along a narrow path, in which appe-
        <lb/>ared many tracks of People all going up
        <lb/>some barefoot and some not; at
        <lb/>length he came to a house, and the
        <lb/>Door opened, for him to go in, which
        <lb/>he did, where he beheld the beauti
        <lb/>fulest Man sitting that ever he
        <lb/>saw in his Life, who invited him
        <lb/>to sit down, which he endeavoured
        <lb/>to do, but could not, and tried to
        <lb/>stop, &amp; to talk, but could do neither
        <lb/>so passed on, out at a door oppo-
        <lb/>site to the one he came in at,
        <lb/>when out, he heard a great noise
        <lb/>and after travilling some distan
        <lb/>ces
        <lb/><pb n="23" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_023"/>
        <lb/>he came to another building, which had
        <lb/>an uncommon Large Door, Like a Barn
        <lb/>Door, in which a man met him, who
        <lb/>looked very dismal, his Mouth appeared
        <lb/>to move in different shapes, from one
        <lb/>side of his Face to the other, this person
        <lb/>conducted him in, where he beheld num-
        <lb/>bers like Indians who seemed to be Dr-
        <lb/>unken &amp; very noisy, and looked very
        <lb/>Distressed, some of whom he knew,
        <lb/>who had been Dead several years.
        <lb/>Amongst them was one very old white
        <lb/>headed Woman, whom they told
        <lb/>him was dying, and when she went,
        <lb/>the World would go too. there
        <lb/>appeared to be a fire place on the
        <lb/>ground, although he could not
        <lb/>discern anything but smoked &amp;
        <lb/>ashes, of which their hair on
        <lb/>their heads were Covered, He
        <lb/>soon found he could sit and talk
        <lb/>fast
        <lb/><pb n="24" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_024"/>
        <lb/>enough in this House, which he
        <lb/>could not do in the other.
        <lb/>The person who conducted him in,
        <lb/>who appeared to be their Officianator,
        <lb/>gave him some stuff to Drink, Like
        <lb/>melted Pewter, which he told him he
        <lb/>could not take, but he insisted he
        <lb/>should, by telling him he could Dr-
        <lb/>ink Wiskey &amp; get Drunk, and that
        <lb/>was no worse to take than it, he
        <lb/>then took it, which he thought burnt him very
        <lb/>much, He then took a chain &amp; bound
        <lb/>round him, he asked him what that
        <lb/>was for, he told him to prevent
        <lb/>him from going after Women &amp;
        <lb/>Other Men’s Wives, He then told
        <lb/>him to go strike a Woman, who was
        <lb/>sitting there, which he attempted
        <lb/>to do, but could not. for his arms
        <lb/>were off, He told him the reason
        <lb/>of his loosing his arms, was because
        <lb/>he
        <lb/><pb n="25" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_025"/>
        <lb/>had often been guilty of striking his
        <lb/>wife, and if he would entirely quit
        <lb/>that practice, he would have his arms
        <lb/>made whole again, and if he forsook
        <lb/>all other Evil practices which he had
        <lb/>be guilty of, he should have a home
        <lb/>in the first House which he entered.
     </p><p>He was then bid to go home. when
        <lb/>he awoke he found himself crying &amp;
        <lb/>could not tell his dream for some
        <lb/>time after, for Crying, for he knew
        <lb/>it was true, And confest in the
        <lb/>Council that he had been guilty
        <lb/>of all those actions above mentioned.
     </p><p>After l had considered the matter
        <lb/>well, I told him, I believed his Dr-
        <lb/>eam was true, and hoped he would
        <lb/>remember it as long as he lived &amp; c.
        <lb/>He said he intended to try to do
        <lb/>better than he had done and
        <lb/>intend
        <lb/><pb n="26" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_026"/>
        <lb/>intended to learn to read.
     </p><p>I told them, (respecting the old
        <lb/>grey headed Woman) I thought
        <lb/>She was the Mother of wickedness
        <lb/>and as they had been so long in a
        <lb/>Dark &amp; Evil State, I thought She
        <lb/>must be white Headed. and did
        <lb/>hope she was dying from among
        <lb/>them, and when she was Dead,
        <lb/>the Worldly Spirit would go too.

        <lb/>Daughter who had been dead
        <lb/>upwards of 4 months. They
        <lb/>prepared much food of differ-
        <lb/>ent kinds and took it to a Ca
        <lb/>bin near their Burying ground
        <lb/>where they eat, old and young,
        <lb/>a very great number, their
        <lb/>Custom is that each one must
        <lb/>tast the others Dish.

        <lb/>they supposed to be a Witch
        <lb/>or that She had poisoned oth-

        <lb/>he heard some body call to him
        <lb/>out of the house, he immediately
        <lb/>arose and went out, his daughter

        <lb/>he told her he would soon be back,
        <lb/>and as he stood without, he saw
        <lb/>three men by the side of the
        <lb/>house, he then fainted and fell
        <lb/>gently to the ground without
        <lb/>being any Sick; the men had
        <lb/>Bushes in their hands with

        <lb/>he thought he took one berry off of each mans bush
        <lb/>this summer. They told him
        <lb/>the great Spirit was much dis-
        <lb/>pleased with his people’s getting
        <lb/>drunk, and other gross Evils
        <lb/>which they were guilty of, but
        <lb/>as to himself they could not charge
        <lb/>him with anything, except
        <lb/>sometimes geting drunk, but as
        <lb/>he had been Sick a great while, he
        <lb/>had thought more upon the gre-
        <lb/>at Spirit, and was preserved
        <lb/>from drinking Strong drink to
        <lb/>excess, and if he got well he

        <lb/>for the great Spirit knew (not only

        <lb/>also their every thoughts, and that
        <lb/>there was some very bad ones among
        <lb/>them, who would poison others, but
        <lb/>one of them was lately killed, yet
        <lb/>there still remained one like her,
        <lb/>who was a man. He requested

        <lb/>had any Dri’d Berries amongst

        <lb/>when a large number of them assem-
        <lb/>bled with shorter notice than ever
        <lb/>I had seen them before, men Wo-
        <lb/>men &amp; Children, many of whom
        <lb/>appeared Solid and weighty , where-
        <lb/>in I felt the love of God flowing
        <lb/>powerfully amongst us, and near
        <lb/>the close had to communicate some
        <lb/>Council to them, which was (I be-
        <lb/>lieve well accepted,) the old
        <lb/>Chiefs sister came to us after
        <lb/>the Council was over, and
        <lb/>thanked me for what I had
        <lb/>said to them.
        <lb/>Note: The three persons afforesaid
        <lb/>told
        <lb/><pb n="43" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_043"/>
        <lb/>told him there was four of them, but
        <lb/>one did not come, expecting to come
        <lb/>to see him time hence. And he often
        <lb/>told his Brother <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, he
        <lb/>expected that person would soon
        <lb/>come. as he contiued in a poor
        <lb/>state of Health for many Weeks af-
        <lb/>ter, one night he Drempt the ab-
        <lb/>sent person came (who appeared
        <lb/>like the great Spirit) and askt him
        <lb/>if he did not remember the three
        <lb/>men who came to him some time
        <lb/>before, and told him there was
        <lb/>four of them altogether, but one of
        <lb/>them staid behind, and intended to
        <lb/>come some time after, and he was
        <lb/>the very one, now come to take
        <lb/>him
        <lb/><pb n="44" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_044"/>
        <lb/>him along if he was willing to go
        <lb/>as he pitied him seeing he had
        <lb/>suffered very much; He did not give
        <lb/>him any answer, whether he would go
        <lb/>with him or not, but in the morning
        <lb/>when he awoke he said he would go
        <lb/>and put on his best Clothes, then
        <lb/>wished to see his Brother, and was
        <lb/>affraid he should not get to see him
        <lb/>before he would be gone, as he was
        <lb/>some distance off, a messenger
        <lb/>went immediately to inform his brother
        <lb/>thereof, who when he came, attended
        <lb/>pretty steadily with him through the
        <lb/>course of the day, and about evening
        <lb/>he fainted away, which held him
        <lb/>but for a short space of time, after
        <lb/>recovering
        <lb/><pb n="45" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_045"/>
        <lb/>recovering he told his Brother, he
        <lb/>must go, but not forever, he thought,
        <lb/>as long as he and many more of his
        <lb/>people was not willing to  let him
        <lb/>go, and that Man or Spirit was
        <lb/>free to let him return, after go-
        <lb/>ing some distance with him. He
        <lb/>told his brother not to put any more
        <lb/>clothes on him, or move him, if he
        <lb/>did go, soon after said he was now
        <lb/>going, and he expected to return, but
        <lb/>thought he should go so far as to see
        <lb/>his son who had been dead several
        <lb/>years, and his brothers Daughter who
        <lb/>had been dead about seven months.
     </p><p>He then fainted or fell into a Trance
        <lb/>in which posture he remained
        <lb/>about
        <lb/><pb n="46" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_046"/>
        <lb/>seven hours, his Legs &amp; arms were
        <lb/>cold, his body warm, but breathless, he
        <lb/>knew not how he went out of the Wor-
        <lb/>ld, but soon perceived a guide going
        <lb/>before him, who appeared to have
        <lb/>a Bow &amp; one arrow, and was dressed
        <lb/>in a Clear Sky Couler, his guide
        <lb/>told him to look forward, when he
        <lb/>did, behold the two deceased ones
        <lb/>before noted, was coming to meet
        <lb/>them, dressed in the manner of his
        <lb/>guide, and after embracing each
        <lb/>other they turned aside to sit down
        <lb/>to converse with each together
        <lb/>where in the Daughter exprest
        <lb/>her sorrow, in freequent hearing
        <lb/>her father (viz) <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
        <lb/>and
        <lb/><pb n="47" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_047"/>
        <lb/>and brother <persName key="habee1">Henry</persName> disputing together
        <lb/>some times so high as to get very an-
        <lb/>gry at each other, her brother think-
        <lb/>ing he knew more than his father,
        <lb/>and would not take his advice, but
        <lb/>must have his own  way, which
        <lb/>was very wrong, the guide then told
        <lb/>her to stop, He would speak, and
        <lb/>said it was true what she had said a bout
        <lb/>her brother abusing his Father,
        <lb/>for he ought to obey him as long
        <lb/>as he lives. The young man then
        <lb/>addressed his Father in this way,
        <lb/>being concerned that he had suffer-
        <lb/>ed so much and that his own Son
        <lb/>then living had taken so little
        <lb/>care of him, but would go out of
        <lb/>the way when his father grew
        <lb/>worse
        <lb/><pb n="48" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_048"/>
        <lb/>for fear of having some trouble,
        <lb/>he thought he had no sense in
        <lb/>so doing. Guide, said every
        <lb/>Son ought to do good for their father
        <lb/>further said, he was glad he had
        <lb/>told the truth to his people of what the three Men
        <lb/>had said to him some time before.
        <lb/>they then told him they had come
        <lb/>in a hurry, and the reason of that was, on ac-
        <lb/>count of his sickness &amp; long suffering
        <lb/>and he had thought much of the
        <lb/>great Spirit, who knew not only
        <lb/>what people was doing but also their
        <lb/>thoughts, Guide said to him, the
        <lb/>three men invited him to eat of
        <lb/>their berries which would help
        <lb/>him, and that he would live to
        <lb/>see
        <lb/><pb n="49" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_049"/>
        <lb/>see such berries ripe the ensueing
        <lb/>summer, which he saw had come to
        <lb/>pass. and that their was two peo-
        <lb/>ple who had lived in their Town
        <lb/>who was disposed to hurt others.
        <lb/>but one was now dead, the other yet
        <lb/>living. They mentioned one fault
        <lb/>they had against him, that of get-
        <lb/>ting Drunk, time back, but as he
        <lb/>had declined it, and concluded
        <lb/>if he got well to do so no more;
        <lb/>they would forgive him, and he
        <lb/>must quit all kinds of frolicks &amp;
        <lb/>dancing, except their Worship
        <lb/>dance, for that was right, as
        <lb/>they did not make use of any Liquor
        <lb/>at the time &amp; c.
        <lb/>Guide, told him it was very of-
        <lb/>ten
        <lb/><pb n="50" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_050"/>
        <lb/>often the case that people were apt
        <lb/>to take too much strong drink, its
        <lb/>the great Spirit who made it to use
        <lb/>but did not make it to hurt people
        <lb/>and the Indians did not kee
        <lb/>from injureing themselves greatly
        <lb/>by it, and if they do still get drunk,
        <lb/>abuse themselves and injure others
        <lb/>they need not expect to come to
        <lb/>that happy place. Guide told
        <lb/>him to look round towards the
        <lb/>river, which he did, and saw ma-
        <lb/>ny Canoes loaded with Kegs of Whis-
        <lb/>key, and also saw an ugly fellow
        <lb/>whom the guide told him was the
        <lb/>D.l. going about very busy doing
        <lb/>and making all the noise and
        <lb/>mischief
        <lb/><pb n="51" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_051"/>
        <lb/>mischief he could amongst the peo-
        <lb/>ple. Guid -- Told him they
        <lb/>often drempt, and some times their
        <lb/>dreams were true from the great
        <lb/>Spirit; but they would not believe
        <lb/>it was from him, but from the
        <lb/>Devil, and when the D.l. have told
        <lb/>them something, they have con-
        <lb/>cluded it was the great Spirit,
        <lb/>and that pleases the D.l. he
        <lb/>being thought the greatest and
        <lb/>most honored, having the most
        <lb/>people on his side.
     </p><p>Further told him, that
        <lb/>White people were come into their
        <lb/>Towns to instruct their Chil-
        <lb/>dren, and that is right if they
        <lb/>can all agree to it, but many of
        <lb/><pb n="52" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_052"/>
        <lb/>of them are not willing, but will keep
        <lb/>to their old habits of living, well
        <lb/>that may be right too, but if they do
        <lb/>they must not drink Wisky for
        <lb/>that belongs to white people, and
        <lb/>was not made for Indians.
     </p><p>Guide said, many people thinks
        <lb/>what they are doing of, but He
        <lb/>sees &amp;  knows all things and nothing is hid
        <lb/>from Him.
     </p><p>Guide mentioned one circumstance
        <lb/>which he was sorry for, that was,
        <lb/>their would be shortly great sickness
        <lb/>in their Village, unless they did
        <lb/>amend their ways, and think
        <lb/>more upon the great Spirit, who
        <lb/><pb n="53" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_053"/>
        <lb/>who might then perhaps see
        <lb/>cause to remove it. And that
        <lb/>his people must collecdt together
        <lb/>in Worship, and Cook a white Dog
        <lb/>and every one eat thereof, as a
        <lb/>preventative against the sickness.
        <lb/>Guide told him he might
        <lb/>soon get well if his people took
        <lb/>care of him &amp; gave him Medi-
        <lb/>cine. Then told him to re-
        <lb/>turn; and that he would not see
        <lb/>them any more untill he Died,
        <lb/>and perhaps not them, except
        <lb/>he did that which was right &amp; good
        <lb/>as long as he lived, which would
        <lb/>be untill the hair on his head was
        <lb/>about half gray, then he must
        <lb/>leave the World, and never return
        <lb/>any
        <lb/><pb n="54" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_054"/>
        <lb/>any more.
     </p><p> After his Brother heared
        <lb/>those sayings he called a Council
        <lb/>the same evening, and sent his
        <lb/>Son for me to attend in the morning
        <lb/>which I did, and heard them rehearse
        <lb/>the matter, after which they reques-
        <lb/>ted me to tell them whether I be-
        <lb/>lieved it to to be true. I told them
        <lb/>there had been Instances of the
        <lb/>same kind amongst White people
        <lb/>even of the Quakers, falling into
        <lb/>a Trance, and saw both the good
        <lb/>place, and bad place, and seen many
        <lb/>Wonderful sights, which I did
        <lb/>believe. and told them I could
        <lb/>see no reason why it should not
        <lb/>be the case with them, as we are all
        <lb/><pb n="55" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_055"/>
        <lb/>all of one Flesh &amp; Blood made by the
        <lb/>great Spirit; although there appe-
        <lb/>ared no reason in my view why it
        <lb/>should not be true, yet perhaps,
        <lb/>as there was so much of it, the man
        <lb/>might not have recollected so as
        <lb/>to tell it exact as he seen or heard
        <lb/>it. more I said, to the same perport,
        <lb/>and they appeared satisfied.
     </p><p>The afternoon of the same day
        <lb/>they prepared a white Dog to
        <lb/>eat, and burnt his skin to ashes
        <lb/>During which time it was burning
        <lb/>a number of them were Circled
        <lb/>around the Fire, singing shout-
        <lb/>ing &amp; dancing greatly; after
        <lb/>which they all partook of their
        <lb/>Delicious dish of Dogmeat &amp; c.
        <lb/><pb n="56" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_056"/>
        <lb/>The morning following I went to <persName key="cornp2">Corn-

        <lb/>the Sick man sayings, (who had
        <lb/>then much recovered of his sick-
        <lb/>ness) at the same time the old Chief
        <lb/>said he liked some ways of the
        <lb/>white people very well, and some
        <lb/>ways of the Indians also, and he
        <lb/>thought it would take some length
        <lb/>of time, to lead them out of
        <lb/>all their own Customs, &amp; as to
        <lb/>their Worship Dance which they
        <lb/>hold twice a year, they intended
        <lb/>to keep it up, as they could not
        <lb/>read, they knew of no other way
        <lb/>of Worshiping the great Spi-
        <lb/>rit, if they declined that they

        <lb/>would have no manner of Worship at

        <lb/>white people who killed our Saviour
        <lb/>how he had heard about our
        <lb/>Saviour I knew not, but it seems
        <lb/>he had. I told him it was
        <lb/>the Jews, who crucify’d or kill’d
        <lb/>Him, and whether they were
        <lb/>white, red, or black or what cou-
        <lb/>ler they were of I knew not,
        <lb/>neither did I know but Indians
        <lb/>were their descendants; for as
        <lb/>many of their habits were semi-
        <lb/>lar to the Jews, in former days.
     </p><p>Yet nevertheless, I told
        <lb/>him we were all still, Curcify-
        <lb/>ing &amp; killing Him, while we we
        <lb/>re doing Wickedly. He said
        <lb/><pb n="58" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_058"/>
        <lb/>said that was very true, very
        <lb/>true. Several other Indians

        <lb/>Thus matters ended at that time.

        <lb/>which would be very astonishing
        <lb/>to those who had never beheld

        <lb/>and in various figures, most of
        <lb/>the men &amp; Boys, were painted,
        <lb/>little or much, and many of them
        <lb/>were dressed in a very superflu-
        <lb/>ous manner, as also were the
        <lb/>Women array’d, to that degree
        <lb/>that some of their Strouds, or Pet-

        <lb/>dollars, which are over laid
        <lb/>with silk Ribands of divers
        <lb/>coulars. The females way of da-
        <lb/>nce, is by moveing their feet
        <lb/>sideway when set close together,
        <lb/>and also motioning their hands

        <lb/>to the ground, but are silent.
        <lb/>at certain intervals, of their
        <lb/>dances, some of the fore rank of
        <lb/>men made speeches to the com-
        <lb/>pany, by way of Preaching,
        <lb/>especially one who was particu-

        <lb/>know when their business
        <lb/>then in agitation was gone th-
        <lb/>rough. The day following
        <lb/>they were engaged in a Hustling

        <lb/>about ready to meet me in

        <lb/>and for the most part were very

        <lb/>manner, to the Washing of my

        <lb/>learning them in a few weeks
        <lb/>hence, and return home to my
        <lb/>native Land, and not knowing
        <lb/>that I should be favoured with
        <lb/>such another opportunity of
        <lb/>meeting so many of them toge-
        <lb/>ther, was willing to drop

        <lb/>take them by the Hand &amp;

        <lb/>happy Life, not only the present
        <lb/>one, but that which is to come,
        <lb/>I also set forth my disunity, with
        <lb/>their vanity &amp; Idolitrous way of
        <lb/>Worshiping the Great Spirit;
        <lb/>in a full belief if was displeas-

        <lb/>acted, although it were their fore-
        <lb/>Fathers Customs, I believed their
        <lb/>was a loud call to them to come
        <lb/>forth &amp; learn better, but as they
        <lb/>had remarked that it was given
        <lb/>to their forefathers so to Worship
        <lb/>and
        <lb/><pb n="67" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_067"/>
        <lb/>and thought it right for them

        <lb/>of their aged Fathers. but
        <lb/>Honestly acknowledged they
        <lb/>had changed it to a more prof-
        <lb/>ligate way &amp; did not hold it
        <lb/>so solemn as their forefathers
        <lb/>used to do. I queried with
        <lb/>them why they were so unwil-
        <lb/>ling to part with some of
        <lb/>their forefathers mode of Life
        <lb/>and had taken so readily to
        <lb/>other some, so very Injurious
        <lb/>to them; that of Strong
        <lb/>drink, and that of decking
        <lb/>&amp; adorning themselves with
        <lb/>such very extravigant su-

        <lb/>their forefathers were not ac-
        <lb/>customed to, but I believed,
        <lb/>were glad to get Skins to co-
        <lb/>ver themselves with. at this
        <lb/>some of them Laughed.
     </p><p>I streeniously pressed them to lay
        <lb/>out their Money for such articles
        <lb/>as would be useful to them, not
        <lb/>to spend it for nought.
     </p><p>After a pause, they expressed
        <lb/>great thankfulness for what I had
        <lb/>mentioned to them, and said
        <lb/>they could not say it was not true
        <lb/>for as I had been with them a long while
        <lb/><pb n="69" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_069"/>
        <lb/>while, they believed I was a good Man,
        <lb/>and had always been willing to
        <lb/>do that that was right amongst
        <lb/>them, but as I was not about to
        <lb/>leave them they felt thankful, that
        <lb/>I &amp; my Companions had bee so fa-
        <lb/>vour’d with good health, ever since
        <lb/>we came amongst them, and
        <lb/>Desir’d that the great Spirit might
        <lb/>conduct me safe home, to see my
        <lb/>relations &amp; Friends there, and that
        <lb/>I must write back, to let them
        <lb/>know how I get along &amp; c.
     </p><p>They then took me by the hand
        <lb/>and we parted like Brothers.

        <lb/>viding for yourselves and your
        <lb/>Cattle, We desire you to speak
        <lb/>freely.
     </p><p>Brothers, It has been some satisfac-
        <lb/>tion to us in riding through your Town
        <lb/>to see marks of Industry taking place,
        <lb/>that you are building better &amp; War-
        <lb/>mer Houses to live in, and that so
        <lb/>much of your clear’d Land is planted
        <lb/>with Corn, Potatoes, Beans, Squashes,
        <lb/>Cucumbers &amp; c. and to see these
        <lb/>articles kept in good order.
     </p><p>Brothers, We observe where
        <lb/>your new houses are building that
        <lb/>the Timber is very much cut off,

        <lb/>ed to clear, and make it fit for
        <lb/>Ploughing, we believe it to be very
        <lb/>good land for Wheat as well as Corn,
        <lb/>and as the White people are settling
        <lb/>around you, the Deer and other game
        <lb/>will grow scarcer, and more diffi-
        <lb/>cult to be taken, we therefore hope
        <lb/>that more of your Men will as-
        <lb/>sist in clearing Land, fencing it,
        <lb/>planting it with Corn, &amp; sowing
        <lb/>it with wheat, you will then have
        <lb/>a supply of Provision more cer-
        <lb/>tain to depend upon than Hunting.
     </p><p>Brothers, we were pleased to
        <lb/>see your Stock of Cattle increased,
        <lb/>the rich bottoms on the river, will

        <lb/>be plenty for them to live on in the
        <lb/>summer season, but as your Win-
        <lb/>ters are long &amp; cold, it will require
        <lb/>something for them to live on in
        <lb/>the Winter, now the White peo-
        <lb/>ple keep their Cattle on Hay, on
        <lb/>Straw, and on Cornfodder, Straw
        <lb/>you cannot get until you raise
        <lb/>Wheat, or other grain, the rich
        <lb/>bottoms if they were put in order
        <lb/>would produce a great deal of
        <lb/>Hay, but for an immediate
        <lb/>supply, we think, if as soon as
        <lb/>you gather your Corn, you
        <lb/>would cut the Stalks close at
        <lb/>the ground, bind them up
        <lb/>in small bundles, and put
        <lb/>them
        <lb/><pb n="78" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_078"/>
        <lb/>them in Stacks, as our young Men
        <lb/>do, they would keep the Cattle
        <lb/>part of the Cold Weather.
     </p><p>Brothers, We are pleased to see
        <lb/>a quantity of new fence made this
        <lb/>Summer near where our young Men
        <lb/>live, and we would not have you
        <lb/>get discouraged at the Labour it
        <lb/>takes, for if you will clear a little
        <lb/>more Land every year, and fence
        <lb/>it, you will soon get enough to
        <lb/>raise what bread you want, as
        <lb/>well as some for Grass to make
        <lb/>Hay for Winter.
     </p><p>Brothers -- We understand
        <lb/>you are desirous to discourage
        <lb/>Whiskey from being brought
        <lb/>amongst
        <lb/><pb n="79" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_079"/>
        <lb/>amongst you, with which we are
        <lb/>much pleased, and should be glad
        <lb/>you could entirely keep it away,
        <lb/>for to get it, you give your mo-
        <lb/>ney which you should have to
        <lb/>buy Clothes with, and to buy
        <lb/>Oxen and Ploughs with, to Work
        <lb/>your Land; and it does not

     <p>After the afore-

        <lb/>nent &amp; judicious Council, to them
        <lb/>verbally. But before they
        <lb/>could make reply to us, on what

        <lb/>they wished to know, whether I

        <lb/>was still in the determination of re-

        <lb/>in a short time, as it were for me
        <lb/>to come amongst them, yet
        <lb/>nevertheless, as our Friends had
        <lb/>come forward, we did intend to
        <lb/>consult eachother about it, after
        <lb/>the Council, for as they were
        <lb/>older than myself, and sometimes
        <lb/>old people knew better than
        <lb/>young ones. but I told them
        <lb/>they could give our friends an an-
        <lb/>swer, in respect to their satis-
        <lb/>faction with our being amongst
        <lb/>them, and desired they might

        <lb/>they then began, and said, they had

        <lb/>selves about us but could not find
        <lb/>out any fault against us, but
        <lb/>that we were always doing what

     </p><p>We then requested the Indians

        <lb/>after a pause, friends exprest a

        <lb/>to remain in my present Port
        <lb/>during the ensueing Winter, but
        <lb/>believed it right to leave the mat-
        <lb/>ter pretty much to myself. I
        <lb/>then exprest how important
        <lb/>the concern had been with me
        <lb/>and that I stood fully resign’d
        <lb/>to the divine will, either to go, or
        <lb/>to stay longer, had at times no
        <lb/>choice in it, but as I had been
        <lb/>favoured to see Latterly &amp; at
        <lb/>that present time, pretty clear-
        <lb/>ly, that it was my Duty to
        <lb/>return home. Some of

        <lb/><pb n="83" facs="hv_hs_journal_v2_1799_083"/>

        <lb/>to stay a little while longer,
        <lb/>but thought they must leave it
        <lb/>to myself, and that I thought,
        <lb/>it was my Duty to return home,
        <lb/>or words to the same purport.
     </p><p><persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, replid he had
        <lb/>nothing more to say to it, but,
        <lb/>that it might be right for me,
