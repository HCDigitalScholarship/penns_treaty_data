                    <salute>My dear Friends, </salute></opener>

                <p>We reached this Place last evening, and some of<lb/> us, being thoroughly tired
                    of rising early and lying down late, are<lb/> glad to embrace the grateful
                    intermission of first day, among<lb/> Friends, at the expense of to day: so we
                    have put out our<lb/> Cloaths, to be washed' and are mostly employed, in the
                    different<lb/> nooks and corners of an old fashioned house, in opening our<lb/>
                    hearts to the tender Connections we have left behind us, the<lb/> more endeared
                    by distance, difficulty, and solitude. The<lb/> particulars of our Journey are,
                    so far, scarcely interesting<lb/> enough to bear recital: yet I should feel
                    myself wanting to<lb/> the partiality of love and affection if I were to omit
                    what<lb/> I know will be grateful to you, and so shall proceed from<lb/> stage
                    to stage with all the regularities of a Journalist.<lb/> Having all collected at
                        <persName key="chain1">Caspar Haines</persName>'s by 3 o'clock,<lb/> we took
                    leave of the Friends who accompanied us about 5,<lb/> and rode, mostly in the
                    rain, over very muddy road, 10<lb/> miles to <persName key="dcumm1">David
                        Cummings</persName>'s, on the old York Road, where<lb/> we were kindly
                    entertained, two of our Company going to <lb/>
                    <pb n="2"/> Samuel Gomere's [a friend in the neighborhood] to lodge. Early<lb/>
                    next morning they gave us a breakfast, and bade us good steed<lb/> which we
                    improved by riding 20 miles to <persName key="opaxt1">Oliver Paxson</persName>'s
                    neat<lb/> Carrigells Ferry on Delaware, to dinner; and in the after noon,<lb/>
                    crossing the river a few miles above, 17 to <persName key="hclaf1">Henry
                        Clafton</persName>'s<lb/> in <placeName key="kingw">Kingwood</placeName>, a
                    pleasant village on very high ground where<lb/> we were accommodated for the
                    night as before. Next day<lb/> we rode 40 miles, including 5 wherein we mifed
                    the road, and<lb/> had a grand view of the blue mountains, forming a vast<lb/>
                    amphitheatre of hills and woods around <placeName key="easto"
                    >Easton</placeName>, the sun<lb/> glittering upon its white houses and shine
                    rendering it a most<lb/> beautiful object the 10 miles distant. Dined on bread
                    and<lb/> butter, and honey, about 11 oclock and reached <persName key="jlund1"
                        >Jacob Lundy</persName>'s<lb/> [the husband of <persName key="slunda1">Sarah
                        Lundy</persName>] time enough to see the sun<lb/> shed his last rays with
                    unusual brilliance over the field and<lb/> woods. I was pleased to see his
                    Father and Mother spending<lb/> their last days in ease and quiet in a little
                    hut built for<lb/> them at one end of the house, from which they have the
                    plea<lb/>sure of seeing their Descendants thrive about them, and<lb/> deceiving
                    the lediousness of leisure by chopping a passel of<lb/> mending a stocking to
                    keep up the semblance of wanted utility </p>
                <pb n="3"/>
                <p>Next morning his so a lad of 15 guided us several miles<lb/> across intricate
                    roads toward <placeName key="susse">Sussex Court House</placeName>, a
                    dismal<lb/> looking place with a jail under it, and a whipping post and<lb/>
                    stocks before, no the almost absolute insignia of<lb/> the cruel system of past
                    times, soon I hope to be every where<lb/> supplanted by the spade and the
                    distaff. Our<lb/> last Host, as we were going out of the Settlements of
                    Friends,<lb/> had directed us to the hospitality of a <persName key="chath1"
                        >Colonel Hathorne</persName>,<lb/><del>for the night</del> at a suitable
                    distance for the night, not<lb/> recollecting that he was a member of Congress,
                    which we dis-<lb/> covered on the road, and as he was not at home went 10
                    miles<lb/> further to a place called <placeName key="chest">Chester</placeName>,
                    and lodged at an Inn. The<lb/> Landlord was old enough to remember old times
                    with an evident<lb/> preference, and with respect to Government in particular
                    he<lb/> thought as somebody else does sometimes that we had got out of the
                    frying pan into the fire. This<lb/> being our first tavern fare we did not take
                    it kindly, and<lb/> started off, <del>before</del> without breakfast, tho' we
                    were glad afterward to<lb/> take it as we could get it, and rejoiced when we
                    came in<lb/> sight of the <placeName key="nrive">North River</placeName> which
                    is here a mile and a half<lb/> wide; but so diminished by comparison with the
                    prodigious<lb/> mountains which surround it, that more of our Company ex <lb/>
                    <pb n="4"/>(Recollecting the <geogName key="susqu">Susquehannah</geogName> at
                        <placeName key="wrigh">Wright's Ferry</placeName>) thought it<lb/> cept
                    myself more than half of one. Two miles along those<lb/> brought us to <persName
                        key="dburn1">Daniel Byrnes</persName>'s, where we seemed at home<lb/> again,
                    staid through the heat of the day, the weaker now<lb/> growing worser, and rode
                    12 miles in the evening<lb/> to this hospitable mansion, whose venerable Owner
                    now in his<lb/> 79th year, when he crossed the river to settle here 40
                    years<lb/> ago was the only Friend in there part and held a meeting at<lb/> his
                    own house some time, has lived to see ten of his children<lb/> married and
                    settled among Friends so near him that he<lb/> could visit them all in a day.
                    Tomorrow evening we intended<lb/> making a short stage to a Friends house, and
                    expect to reach<lb/>
                    <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName>, about 80 mile from here, by 3rd day

                    <salute> My dear Friends</salute></opener>
                <p>Agreeably to the expectation given you in my<lb/> last I write again from this
                    low-dutch City, of which you<lb/> will have a tolerable idea when you figure to
                    yourselves<lb/> an old square Church (with a roof almost high enough<lb/> for a
                    steeple, capped with a clumsy belfry) fixed trans-<lb/> versely across the
                    center streets, which wind about it<lb/> in all directions, generally presenting
                    gable ends, scol-<lb/> loped with battlements, and often antiquated with the
                    lead-<lb/> ed casements that have so long given way to the improve-<lb/> ments
                    of modern times elsewhere. But I am un-<lb/> intentionally rambling from
                        <placeName key="ehall1">Edward Hallock</placeName>'s patri-<lb/> archal
                    family; <del>before</del> I have told you that his Fa-<lb/>ther lived to see 140
                    of his Descendants, to the 4th ge-<lb/>nerations; and <persName key="ehall1"
                        >Edward</persName> himself begins to keep count for<lb/> 100 to the third:
                    like somebody else he is still more<lb/> active than either of his sons,
                    abounding with life and<lb/> spirit, anecdote and observation. One
                    circumstance<lb/> of his life deserves particular attention: shortly after<lb/>
                    the British took possession of New York and Long Island,<lb/> I think in 1776,
                    he attended the Yearly Meeting then<lb/>
                    <pb n="6"/> held at <del>although</del>
                    <orgName key="nyym">Westbury</orgName> tho' all communication was for-<lb/>
                    bidden under pain of death. Being somewhat doubtful<lb/> of the propriety of
                    this risqueing his life, he was confirmed<lb/> by a dream, in which he saw and
                    heard the Persons who<lb/> should trouble him for this act of religious duty
                    threatening<lb/> what they would do to him: but he was assured that they<lb/>

                    himself, and even what to say when<lb/> they should question him. Singular as it
                    may appear<lb/> the latter was couched in the following verses:<lb/>
                    <quote type="poem">O mortal Men! your ways and works consider,<lb/>Sleep not in
                        death least there you be forever<lb/> Awake! and stand upright, that you

                    Safety<lb/> he boldly addressed them in these words, <said>If I have done
                        any<lb/> thing worthy of death or of bonds I am ready to an-<lb/>swer for
                        it.</said> They seemed at a loss to begin with him,<lb/> which gave him an
                    opportunity to ask them if he should<lb/> tell them his dream. They said he
                    might, and he re- <lb/>
                    <pb n="7"/> repeated it to them as above; upon which they seemed as<lb/>
                    tonished, and dismissed him til the next meeting: but they<lb/> did not then
                    make a board; which was the case afterward<lb/> again, and again, till they
                    finally deferred his case for a<lb/> month; saying they should never be able to
                    make a board<lb/> else' and when he attended again there was nobody there<lb/>
                    but the Chairman, and he told him he might go about<lb/> his business. Not
                    feeling perfectly easy to travel thro'<lb/> the Country on first day evening, we
                    started fresh on<lb/> 2.nd day morning, glad to be under way again,
                    feel-<lb/>ing our minds more and more drawn to our object as we<lb/> proceed.
                    Edward set us 5 miles on our way, and we<lb/> rode as usual thro' a rugged and
                    broken Country to<lb/>
                    <placeName key="esopu">Eusopus</placeName>, a town of 80 or a hundred
                    houses<lb/> mostly well built with stone, an inscription on the<lb/> Court House
                    where we dined (for it was also a very<lb/> decent Inn and the County Jail)
                    informed us that<lb/> the town was burnt by the British in the year 1777,<lb/>
                    so completely we were afterward told that just one<lb/> house and one barn
                    escaped the flames. This was done<lb/> under the command of General Vaughan,who
                    was then<lb/> waiting, on board of the Transport in the <placeName key="nrive"
                        >North River</placeName>,<lb/> to facilitate the unsuccessful attempt of
                    General Burgoyne, <lb/>
                    <pb n="8"/> in revenge for the cruel treatment of the Friends<lb/> to the former
                    Government at this place, and the rash<lb/> conduct of the Townspeople in living
                    upon the Ships<lb/> as they lay at anchor. From this place we rode several<lb/>
                    miles through a deep sand, like that of Jersey covered<lb/> with pines, saw a
                    beautiful waterfall upon our<lb/> left; and crossed a small creek in a Scow, for
                    the first<lb/> time since we left the <placeName key="delaw"
                        >Delaware</placeName>. We did not<lb/> reach <placeName key="catsk1"
                        >Katskill</placeName> the place of our destination for the night<lb/> till
                    dusk, and could not then get over the Creek<lb/> to the town, because the Boat
                    was aground on the other<lb/> side. In this dilemma the Owner of an adjoining
                    House,<lb/> by name <placeName key="jboga1">Jacob Bigordeiss</placeName>,
                    offered us the best accommo-<lb/>dations his house could afford; which we gladly
                    accepted.<lb/> He freely expressed his good will when we<lb/> told him what was
                    our business; and in the morning<lb/> took us out to see a place, near the
                    Creek, where<lb/> the side of a hill had gradually sunk down a few<lb/> days
                    before between 40 and 50 feet. About an acre<lb/> of it has descended
                    perpendicularly; and as much more<lb/> of the lower part had bulged up, and
                    cracked aston-<lb/>ishingly, apparently by the vent of the air confined <lb/>
                    <pb n="9"/> in the cavern into which the hill had fallen. There was a<lb/> flock
                    of sheep upon it at the time, who were seen to scatter<lb/> with the first
                    fright, but finding themselves hemmed in, they hud<lb/>dled together till the
                    earth settled, and then scudded away for<lb/> terra firma. A large current of
                    muddy water had been long ob<lb/> served to issue from this hill, into the tide
                    way, which had pro<lb/>bably almost worn it thro: but there was no appearance of
                    an<lb/> earthquake. Our Host told us that when he came here 6 years ago,<lb/>
                    there were but Nine Houses in the Town, and now there were<lb/> not less than 20
                    Stores, this being a principal outlet for the Weste<lb/>rn Country. After this
                    however our days ride was very uninter<lb/>resting through broken land, and a
                    tract of Pines extending almost<lb/> to Albany, rendered doubly tedious by the
                    incess and turns and win<lb/>dings of the road, often forming a semicircle
                    instead of a line, and<lb/> sometimes turning three sides of a square. I am just
                    not called to dinner and<lb/> so conclude with our distance from <placeName
                        key="oneid">Oneida</placeName>, (supposed to exceed a<lb/> hundred miles)
                    which we have to make by the end of the week, and<lb/> my love and good wishes
                    for you all, as is named, and other en<lb/>quiring Friends...</p>

                <p>My last if I recollect right, was dated this day week;<lb/> yet, as I trusted it
                    to an accidental opportunity, I think it very<lb/> probably you will receive
                    this first. It carried us to <persName key="haupa1">Hendrick<lb/>
                        Aupaumuts</persName>, at <placeName key="newst">New Stockbridge</placeName>,
                    and left us under the good keeping of<lb/>
                    <persName key="lquin1">Lydia Quinney</persName> (for the Wife does not here
                    assume the name of her<lb/> Husband) one of the best Housewives, considering
                    circumstances,<lb/> that we have ever known, no offence I hope to Anybody. You
                    may be sure we were not in<lb/> haste to leave her; yet having appointed to meet
                    the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> on<lb/> 3rd. day afternoon we set
                    out, on foot, and in the rain, though<lb/> it cleared up before we had travelled
                    far, through thick woods,<lb/> and marshy bottoms. Two miles brought us to a
                    little remnant<lb/> of the <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscaroras</orgName>, who
                    fled here 80 or 100 years ago from the banks<lb/> of the Patowmack, and, If I am
                    right, have been ever since incor-<lb/> porated with the ancient <orgName
                        key="sxntns">Five Nations</orgName>, now six. The main<lb/> body of them
                    sided with the British in the late war, and are<lb/> settled on the banks of
                        <placeName key="niaga">Niagara</placeName>. The few that remain<lb/> under
                    the patronage of the <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>, appear helpless
                    and forlorn,<lb/> almost without a Chief, and without a Counsellor. Two
                    miles<lb/> further we came across the scattered hamlets of the <orgName
                        key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName>,<lb/> original Proprietors of this fertile
                    spot, who I think at the Treaty of <lb/>
                    <pb n="20"/> of <placeName key="fstan">Fort Stanwix</placeName>, in 1784,
                    reserved to themselves a Tract of about<lb/> twenty miles square, well watered
                    by several beautiful streams<lb/> upon the border of a charming lake, abounding
                    with Fish. Of<lb/> this however they have since given away one fourth to the
                    different<lb/> Tribes that have claimed <del>that protection</del> kin with
                    them. When they were<lb/> asked to sell they replied: <quote>No, we will not
                        sell our Land,<lb/> to our own Flesh and blood: but we will give you what
                        you<lb/> want.</quote> Another fourth they have lately sold to the State
                    of<lb/> New York, I understand at a dollar an acre (now selling again<lb/> at
                    four and five). The purchase money however is funded, and<lb/> yields them four
                    or five thousand dollars a year, part of which<lb/> is to be vested in Saw
                    Mills, Grist Mills, &amp; &amp; and the remain<lb/>der of in good hands would
                    soon stock their land and enable them <lb/> to live far better than People
                    generally do, even in our happy <lb/> Country. But with all these advantages
                    they drone away their<lb/> lives supinely in idleness and want; their former
                    occupations of fighting<lb/> hunting &amp; naturally ceasing on the White

                    Tribes on this Reservation, who till their land, encrease in a rate<lb/> that
                    would double their numbers in about 30 years. They<lb/> received us kindly, and
                    expressed their willingness to adopt<lb/> our proposals for their gradual
                    civilization, saying <said>the compact<lb/> between our Forefathers was made a

                    confidence may be placed. He is as firm and erect at 78 as our People

                    and good living, in the ru-<lb/>diments of which the two latter are already
                    pretty well grounded.<lb/> On 7th. day morning we visited the <orgName
                        key="brotherton">Brothertons</orgName>, and were sur-<lb/>prised to find
                    them dressed like us, speaking the same<lb/> language, and many of them almost
                    as fair as ourselves.<lb/> Most of the Children having chesnut hair, and some
                    curled.<lb/> They consist of 40 or 50 Families that have been brought<lb/> up in
                    different parts of New England, Long Island, &amp; and<lb/> so naturalized to
                    our language, and customs that<lb/> they now use no other; which has such an
                    effect upon<lb/> persons and principles that I am persuaded they may incorporate
                    with the White<lb/> Inhabitants, in and age or two, upon equal terms. These<lb/>
                    People affairs have been lately put upon an advantageous<lb/> footing by the

                    <pb n="22"/> and they appear to us to be in a thriving way, as to

                    <salute>My dear Friends,</salute></opener>

                <p>Little has occurred since my last beside the cus<lb/>tomary disappointment of
                    long expected contingencies, no <persName key="jtayl1">Jacob
                    Taylor</persName><lb/> having yet been heard of, and the usual tediousness and
                    procrastina<lb/>tion of Indian Councils, extraordinarily lengthened out by the
                    novelty<lb/> of our proposals, apparently no less unexpected, than the reply of
                    Her<lb/> Rules to the staff'd Waggoners. "Set thy shoulders to the wheel, and I
                    will<lb/> help thee" We staid at <placeName key="white">Whitestown</placeName> a
                    day or two, and waited upon<lb/>
                    <persName key="jwhit1">Judge White</persName>, and several other persons to whom
                    we were recommended; and<lb/> had the satisfaction to find them all, as well as
                    the Neighborhood in gene<lb/>ral, favorably disposed toward our undertakings;
                    and willing to render<lb/> us any assistance we may be likely to want from them.
                    Here also we<lb/> introduced ourselves to <persName key="jbelk1">Jeremiah
                        Belknap</persName>, Author of the History of New<lb/> Hampshire, and
                        <persName key="jmors1">Jedediah Morse</persName>, who wrote the Geography of
                    the Uni<lb/> ted States; they being on their way to the <orgName key="oneida"
                    />Oneidal Reservation, as Commis<lb/>sioners from the board of Trustees in
                    Boston; for an enquiry into the conduct<lb/> of Missionary Kirkland, of which
                    complaint had been made (principally<lb/> for remissness of duty) to the Scotch
                    Society for propogating the Gospels<lb/> by whom these missions are supported.
                    They seem pleased to<lb/> see us in favour of our errands, of which they
                    expressed a hearty approba<lb/>tion, as the only means of effectually
                    introducing christianity among the <lb/>
                    <pb n="24"/>
                    <gap/>en. Poor Kirkland is now thought to be dangerously ill, but if<lb/> he
                    should recover he will probably make himself very easy about their<lb/>
                    decision, as he has feathered his nest thoroughly long since. <placeName
                        key="white">Whitestown</placeName><lb/> is the Capital of the Couny of
                        <placeName key="herki">Herkimer</placeName>, which affords an instance of
                    the<lb/> rapid settlement of these parts, scarcely to be parrallelled. Twelve
                    years<lb/> ago <persName key="jwhit1">Judge White</persName> came here the first
                    settler, and lived sometime in a cave,<lb/> Within six years there were 300
                    Familys hearabout; from that<lb/> time as long as it was possible to calculate
                    the numbers doubled every<lb/> year; and now they counted, on a late census,
                    forty three thousand<lb/> Souls. On fourth day morning we all met again at
                        <placeName key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> Dined heartily<lb/> upon excellent
                    Salmon, with which the lake abounds from 10 to 15 lbs;<lb/> and in the afternoon
                    ranged about to view the Country for a suitable<lb/> situation for building:

                        >Stockbridges</orgName>, upon occasion of some of their People being
                    desirous<lb/> to sell their share of Land, for which they had requested leave a
                    few<lb/> days before, without the knowledge of their Chiefs, by a string of
                    wampum.<lb/> The <orgName key="oneida">Oneidas</orgName> expressively described
                    their original grant of the Land to the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridges</orgName> under the comparison of a
                    steel Dish, which they had given<lb/> to last them forever, expecting they said
                    that they would put a steel spoon into<lb/> it and take care to keep it bright
                    and whole; but they were surprised<lb/> to find that the white People had
                    already got hold of some of their<lb/> hands, and were trying to break the
                    spoon; with all returning the <lb/>
                    <pb n="25"/> wampum as their manner is when they refuse what is requested
                    by<lb/> telling them that the Dish was given to them, and their Children,
                    and<lb/> that the spoon should never be taken out of their mouths. Having<lb/>
                    sketched out a plan in writing for the settlement at <placeName key="oneid"
                        >Oneida</placeName>, three of<lb/> us went over on 7th day to read it to the
                    Chiefs; that they might have an<lb/> opportunity of considering it before we met
                    the whole Nation in council,<lb/> for a final determination. They then seemed
                    well satisfied tho their expec<lb/>tations had evidently been raised to
                    something more ostensible than<lb/> our present proceedings; but on second Day
                    Morning just as we were set<lb/>ting out, a Runner came in with a note informing
                    us that they were<lb/> gone to <placeName key="fstan">Fort Stanwix</placeName>,
                    to complain of the Surveyors for overrunning the<lb/> boundaries of the last
                    Sale, which will probably delay our business<lb/> some days. Accept my love as
                    usual, dear Father, Mother, Wife,<lb/> Brothers, and Sisters; please to give it
                    freely to all enquiring Friends;<lb/> and remember me particularly to the

                    mentioned in No 4 or 5 the Women sent us a<lb/> message, by the Chief Speaker,

                    them as far they were all very good. All the time we<lb/> were at <persName

                    were contin<lb/>ually sending in strawberrys, milk, butter, and sometimes meal,
                    and<lb/> otherwise manifesting their love and regard. One of his Daughters was
                    at a<lb/> conference ten days ago, a mile from her home, and was delivered of a

                    they are convinced by<lb/> experience, that the only way to make Christians of
                    them effectually is to<lb/> civilize them, if that be possible. We have agreed

                    was in the neighborhood, and intended to have a meeting at <placeName

                    went off with the Chief of the Stockbridges to bid him <lb/>wellcome, the rest
                    of us staying at home to keep up our own meeting, as usual.<lb/> In the evening
                    we collected joyfully at our lodgings, to the number of ten, <persName

                    Next<lb/> morning we had our parting Conference with the <orgName

                    recommended such advice as appeared most necessary for their observance.<lb/>
                    After which an Old Man (baptised many years ago by <persName key="jschm">John

                        I think Jesus will send me some<lb/> comfort in my trouble; but Nobody say
                        anything to me, till more you are come.<lb/> Wish I was young, then I would

                        <p>Brothers, We shall speak but a<lb/> few words. We are glad of your
                            company among us, these three weeks, that <lb/>
                            <pb n="29"/> that, as you told us in the first Council, you might know
                            what was best for all<gap/><lb/> here; and now you tell us what you will
                            do for our nation. We rejoice that the<lb/> Good Spirit has put it into
                            your hearts, and into the hearts of your Brothers at home<lb/> to do us
                            good. We believe it is of the Good Spirit, because your words are
                            weights on<lb/> our minds. Brothers, the offers you make us are great.
                            We did not expect so<lb/> much from Friends. We are thankful to the Good
                            Spirit for putting it into<lb/> your hearts, and for giving you the
                            ability to do it. Brothers, You give us Smith's<lb/> Tools, for which we
                            thank you. We have suffered much for want of them, having been<lb/>
                            obliged to go many miles sometimes, and spend some days, to get on link
                            of a chain mended.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, Your assisting us to build a Grist Mill will be a great thing
                            for us. We have<lb/> suffered many years for want of one, especially our
                            Women, who are obliged to pound over<lb/> corn, they join us to thank
                            you heartily. Brothers, your offer to help us in setting<lb/> up a
                            School is very acceptable to us. Be assured we will do our part towards
                            it. Bro-<lb/>thers, what you propose respecting the money lent us is
                            very agreeable to our minds.<lb/> (It was considered as part of an
                            advance forward building the Mill repayable if ever al<lb/> lowed by
                            Congress) and also the encouragement you offer us by premiums. We
                            hope<lb/> our Young Men will have courage to follow those ways you point
                            out for us. Bro-<lb/> thers, We now freely promise that the Chiefs, and
                            all our orderly Young Men,<lb/> will endeavor to follow your advice, and
                            with the blessing of the Good Spirit we will<lb/> live more than ever as
                            White People do: for we never received such encouragement<lb/> before
                            from any People. We observe what you tell us, that we must be an
                            example<lb/> to other Indians; and we hope to be so more and more.
                            Brothers, We shall not for-<lb/>get what you request for the Young Men
                            you leave behind you. Our minds are<lb/> the same with yours. We will
                            maintain our friendship with them, and will be<lb/> always ready to
                            assist them if they get in trouble. Now Brothers, We spoke<lb/> to you
                            several days ago about the difficulties we are under in not receiving
                            our<lb/> annual income from Government, and we desire that one of your
                            Friends in Phi-<lb/>ladelphia will endeavour to settle that business, so
                            that we can have our<lb/> money punctually, in future</p>

                    <salute>My dear Friends,</salute></opener>
                <p>You will be pleased to hear that a hundred and twenty<lb/> miles travelling since
                    my last have carried us very little farther from Phila<lb/>delphia, especially
                    as we reckon it so much toward home, on the Farther<lb/> way round. On 5th. day
                    morning we took an affectionate leave of fifteen<lb/> or twenty of the <orgName
                        key="stockbridge">Stockbridges</orgName>, who had collected at our Lodgings
                    for that purpose,<lb/> and went over to our own House at the <placeName
                        key="oneid">Oneida</placeName> Farm, where we held our<lb/> week day
                    meeting. We dined together at <persName key="jsken1">Shenandoa's</persName>,
                    and<lb/> observing that the Indians were collecting about us we proposed to take
                    our<lb/> leave of them under the trees, and had a seasonable opportunity with
                    some<lb/> hundreds of Men Women and Children, after which the Chiefs observed
                    that<lb/> now they knew we meant what we said for we had only repeated the
                    same<lb/> speech we made to them before, whereas it was the common practise<lb/>
                    of the White People to speak good words to them at first; but when they<lb/>
                    spoke again they always found that they had changed their minds. A
                    respect-<lb/>able old Woman seemed much tendered at parting, and desired the
                    Interpreter<lb/> to tell us that it was not the custom for Women to speak in
                    Council, but that<lb/> their hearts were sensible of our good words though they
                    had nothing to add to<lb/> them. We rose 12 or 15 miles that evening to a
                    wretched tavern, and turning out as early<lb/> as possible next day arrived at
                    Major Danforth's on the <placeName key="onond">Onondago</placeName>
                    Reser-<lb/>vation, by 10 o'clock. <persName key="ewebs1">Ephraim
                        Webster</persName>, a Young Man who had lived with <lb/>
                    <pb n="38"/>
                    <gap/>seven years, dined with us, and we went in the afternoon to the Town<lb/>
                    consisting of the Council House and 5 or 6 bark cabbins, but the Indians
                    were<lb/> generally out fishing, hunting, &amp; there Corn being already spent.
                    Ten or a<lb/> dozen of them however came together after a while, to whom we
                    opened our<lb/> business, and learned from them that they were about 130 in
                    number and<lb/> received 125 Dollars a year from the Government of New York,
                    which will be<lb/> doubled by a late sale of the greatest part of their Land,
                    leaving them an<lb/> excellent Tract extending four miles by five. They seemed
                    unwilling to<lb/> hear us in the absence of the rest, having evidently formed
                    great expectations<lb/> of something to be done immediately: but we thought it
                    best to proceed so<lb/> they could not readily be got together; and to make them
                    easy left our<lb/> speech in writing, to the effect that they should be
                    furnished with some<lb/> implements of husbandry next Spring, and that we would
                    bring up some<lb/> of their Children to useful learning and trades if they would
                    send<lb/> them down to us. The next afternoon we reached <persName key="fgeer1"
                        >Frederick Gerhart</persName>'s<lb/> near the <orgName key="cayugaind"
                        >Cayuga</orgName> settlement, walked over to one of the hovels in the
                    evening, and appointed<lb/> a Conference for Second day, by sunrise. This Tribe
                    lives principally<lb/> by fishing, the <placeName key="cayug">Cayuga
                        Lake</placeName> 40 miles long, and 2 or 3 wide, abounding in<lb/> Trout,
                    Catfish, and particularly Eels. There are but about eighty of them<lb/> here
                    upon 4000 acres of land, they having lately sold all the rest for<lb/> an
                    annuity of about 1500 Dollars, including 500 they had before. They<lb/> appear
                    to be irreclaimably sunk into the lethargick <lb/>
                    <pb n="39"/> idleness so common in fishing neighborhoods, for neither gratitude
                    no<gap/><lb/> could move more than three men and as many Women to attend
                    ou<gap/><lb/>ment. They acknowledged their ignorance over and over again, &amp;
                    assented to every<lb/>thing, without answering any thing, except that they would
                    send one or two of<lb/> their Boys among us to learn how to interpret for them,
                    if they could per-<lb/>suade their Mothers to let them go. About 11 oclock we
                    crossed the<lb/>
                    <placeName key="cayuc">Cayuga</placeName> Later in a flat bottomed Sloop, with a
                    stiff sale, in 20 minutes, and, dining<lb/> at the Ferry, I amused myself with
                    looking wistfully after the Sloop till<lb/> she dropped sail again on the other
                    side, in remembrance of the ever shifting<lb/> scenery of Delaware. Who will
                    step into the Jersey View for me<lb/> and count how many Sail are in sight this
                    moment. Here we came<lb/> across a Whitestown News Paper, and were not a little
                    pleased to find<lb/> the following <del>ourselves toasted as the enterprising
                        and benevolent Quaker Missionaries </del><lb/> in a long list of Republican

                    disposition of the Neighborhood.<lb/> It rained fast by noon: but as there was
                    Company acquainted with the<lb/> road going on for the next stage, we thought it
                    best to keep with them,<lb/> and rode 12 miles through bad roads and rich land
                    before it ceased, just<lb/> as we came in sight of the <placeName key="senec"

                        >Geneva</placeName>, a thriving<lb/> town of 20 or 10 houses beautifully
                    situated near the outlet of the Lake<lb/> Here we were glad to stop, and dry our

                        Evens</persName> has had<lb/> several meetings among them, to good
                    satisfaction, tho' they appear to have<lb/> god into a strange land, and hung
                    their harps upon the willows. Since<lb/> our return we have been much at a
                    stand, one of our Company, <persName key="jpier1">John Pierce</persName>,<lb/>
                    thinking himself clear of the service, and concluding to return home in<lb/>

                        key="muncy">Muncey</placeName>. But the rest of us are disposed<lb/> to
                    finish the business we came about, though in weakness, and expect to proceed on
                    2nd. day<lb/> for the Indian Settlements on the Genesea, and from there to the

                    and some Quakers<lb/> sent out as they used to live in peace with them and
                    thinks they could still. We pro- <lb/>
                    <pb n="43"/> pose to take one or two Indian Guides, from place to place, who
                    ca<gap/><lb/> a fire, or knock up a hut, when we are under the necessity
                    of<gap/><lb/> woods: from which, with submission to Divine disposal, we hope to

                        key="pitts">Pittsburgh</placeName>, in two or three weeks; of which I
                    shall<lb/> take the first opportunity to let you know, though we shall

                <p>My last, if you have but received it, informed you<gap/><lb/> unexpected return,
                    the present is dated upon the West Branch of <placeName key="susqueh"
                        >Sus-<lb/>quehanna</placeName>, more than half way home, which I hope to
                    reach by<lb/> 6th. or 7th. day next. We left <placeName key="canan"
                        >Canadarquai</placeName> on 3rd. day mor-<lb/>ning the 19th. instead,
                    accompanied by <persName key="alaph1">Abraham Lapham</persName>, one of<lb/> the
                    Friends near <placeName key="mudcr">Mud Creek</placeName>, who attended
                        <persName key="jevan1">Joshua Evens</persName> with a<lb/> fresh horse, to
                    relieve his Mare, whose back was sadly galled soon<lb/> after he left <placeName
                        key="otego">Otego</placeName>. We're shown a small Island, tufted with
                    trees,<lb/> as we rode along the Lake, upon which the Indians<lb/> of this place
                    secreted themselves, drawing up their canoes among<lb/> the bushes, when
                        <persName key="gsull1">General Sullivan</persName> invaded their
                    Country<lb/> in 1778. Reached a new Settlement in the woods, 30 miles<lb/>
                    distant, by 5 o'clock. where, there being no accommodations<lb/> for 12 miles,
                    beyond we spread our blankets on the floor, and slept pretty<lb/> comfortably
                    till day light. Got to Noath the capital of the County<lb/>
                    <gap/>Steuber<gap/> by 10 o'clock, riding <del>with a great deal of
                        pleasure</del>most<lb/> of the way along the banks of the Conhocto,
                    delighted to be once<lb/> more upon running water. The Creek is boatable so
                    high<lb/> in the spring of the year: but the town is more dependant <lb/>

                    <gap/>as a Lake of half a mile in diameter, which has no visible<lb/> inlet, yet
                    the water is always fresh, and well stocked wi<gap/><lb/> large and small Fish.
                    It is very deep and has been sounded<lb/> in some places with 40 fathoms of line
                    without finding bottom.<lb/> Lodged at the <placeName key="ppost">Painted
                        Post</placeName>, a small town two miles below the<lb/> spot from which it
                    takes its name, the grave of an Indian<lb/> Sachem, marked by a high post,
                    crudely painted with figur<gap/><lb/> denoting the numbers by him taken captive
                    or killed in battl<gap/><lb/> Riding almost all day through mountainous and
                    barren land<lb/> we were agreeably relieve by the prospect of an extensive
                    and<lb/> well cultivated flat, though still surrounded with mountains
                    resem<lb/>bling green walls of stupendous height. Next moring crossed and
                    recrrossed<lb/> the <placeName key="tioga">Tioga</placeName>, and several of its
                    branches, till about noon, when we<lb/> crossed the Pennsylvania Line, rejoicing
                    at the thoughts of home<lb/> Lodged at the last house on that side of the
                    Wilderness sur<lb/>rounding the <placeName key="allmo">Alleghany
                        Mountains</placeName>, 43 miles across, with<lb/> but one house near the
                    middle, and that inhabited by a Man<lb/> whose general character is fierce and
                    brutal, suspected of having<lb/> killed a Pedlar who lodged here some months ago
                    on his way<lb/> through, and has never been heard of since. This Wretch we<lb/>
                    <pb n="47"/> determined to avoid, and <persName key="jevan1">Joshua
                        Evens</persName> rouzed us two or three ti<gap/><lb/> o'clock, and finally
                    started in by half after one, the m<gap/><lb/> bright a little past the full.
                    Leaving Ab<gap/><lb/> here, and taking our Landlord for a Guide. We
                    rode<gap/><lb/> day break, along the banks of the <placeName key="tioga"
                        >Tioga</placeName>, through thick woods almost<lb/> impervious to moonshine,
                    silent and slow, every one keeping<lb/> his eye upon the next before, and now
                    and then catching a glimpse<lb/> of <persName key="jevan1">Joshua
                        Evens</persName>'s white coat and horse. Here and there the wood<lb/> opened
                    enough to show the water glistening with moon beams, and<lb/> ever and anon the
                    path way crossed the river to avoid the sidelong<lb/> hills. Stopped to feed
                    about sunrise amidst fog and Gnats and<lb/> gladly turned our backs upon them to
                    encounter the Mountain which continues risi<unclear>g m</unclear>ore<lb/> or less at intervals
                    for 10 or 15 miles the road stony,<lb/> rooty, swampy, and winding to the right
                    and left round fallen<lb/> trees and quagmires. Passed the terrific house before
                    noon,<lb/> and in an hour or two descended the mountain, which is<lb/> here so
                    steep that two miles brings you to the bottom, where<lb/> there is another
                    feeding place, 12 miles from the house we<lb/> put up at for the night, after
                    crossing a branch of Lyconery<lb/> two and thirty times. Next morning reach a
                    Friends House in<lb/> the Settlement of <placeName key="muncy"
                        >Muncey</placeName>, where we seemed at home as soon as we<lb/> sat down,
                    but thought best to proceed for another near the meeting<lb/> house in the
                    afternoon. The Improvements here had been destroyed </p>
                <pb n="48"/>
                <p><gap/>ans during the last war, and some Person had been killed in the <lb/>
                    <gap/>two families of Friends, remained at their habitations with<lb/>
                    <gap/> untill <del>they were carried away</del> the heads of them were taken <lb/>
                    <gap/>after jail as suspected Person; and the door of another
                    <del>house</del><lb/> was marked in the night with the figure of a tortoise,
                    which was<lb/> afterward understood to have been an indication that they might
                    stay with<lb/> safety like a tortoise covered each in its shell. We expect to
                    leave this Place<lb/> on 2nd. Day by way of Catawissy, and I shall probably be
